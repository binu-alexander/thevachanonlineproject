He appeared, according to Luke's account, at the head of about four hundred men. He was probably one of the insurrectionary chiefs or fanatics by whom the land was overrun in the last year of Herod's reign. Josephus speaks of a Theudas who played a similar part at the time of Claudius, about A.D. 44; but the Theudas mentioned by Luke must be a different person from the one spoken of by Josephus.</li></ol>"}
