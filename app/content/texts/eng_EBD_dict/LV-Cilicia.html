Tarsus, the birth-place of Paul, was one of its chief towns, and the seat of a celebrated school of philosophy. Its luxurious climate attracted to it many Greek residents after its incorporation with the Macedonian empire. It was formed into a Roman province, B.C. 67. The Jews of Cilicia had a synagogue at Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_9">Acts 6:9</span>). Paul visited it soon after his conversion(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_21">Galatians 1:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_30">Acts 9:30</span>), and again, on his second missionary journey(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_41">15:41</span>), “he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.” It was famous for its goat’s-hair cloth, called cilicium. Paul learned in his youth the trade of making tents of this cloth.<br>
