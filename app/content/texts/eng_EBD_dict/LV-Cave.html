It was the burying-place of Sarah and of Abraham himself, also of Isaac, Rebekah, Leah, and Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_31">Genesis 49:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_13">50:13</span>).<br>The cave of Makkedah, into which the five Amorite kings retired after their defeat by Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_16,27">10:16, 27</span>).<br>The cave of Adullam (q.v.), an immense natural cavern, where David hid himself from Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_1,2">1 Samuel 22:1, 2</span>).<br>The cave of Engedi (q.v.), now called ‘Ain Jidy, i.e., the “Fountain of the Kid”, where David cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_4">24:4</span>). Here he also found a shelter for himself and his followers to the number of 600 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_29">23:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_1">24:1</span>). “On all sides the country is full of caverns which might serve as lurking-places for David and his men, as they do for outlaws at the present day.” The cave in which Obadiah hid the prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_4">1 Kings 18:4</span>) was probably in the north, but it cannot be identified.<br>The cave of Elijah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_9">1 Kings 19:9</span>), and the “cleft” of Moses on Horeb(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX33_22">Exodus 33:22</span>), cannot be determined.<br>In the time of Gideon the Israelites took refuge from the Midianites in dens and caves, such as abounded in the mountain regions of Manasseh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_2">Judges 6:2</span>).<br>Caves were frequently used as dwelling-places (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_21">Numbers 24:21</span>; Cant.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_14">2:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_16">Jeremiah 49:16</span>; Obad. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR1_3">1:3</span>). “The excavations at Deir Dubban, on the south side of the wady leading to Santa Hanneh, are probably the dwellings of the Horites,” the ancient inhabitants of Idumea Proper. The pits or cavities in rocks were also sometimes used as prisons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_22">Isaiah 24:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_14">51:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC9_11">Zechariah 9:11</span>). Those which had niches in their sides were occupied as burying-places (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK32_23">Ezekiel 32:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_38">John 11:38</span>).<br>
