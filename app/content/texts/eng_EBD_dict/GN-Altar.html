Altars were generally erected in conspicuous places(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_9">Genesis <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_9">22:9</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK6_3">Ezekiel 6:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12">2 Kings 23:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_4">16:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_8">23:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC14_13">Acts 14:13</span>). The word is used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_10">Hebrews 13:10</span> for the sacrifice offered upon it--the sacrifice Christ offered.<br>Paul found among the many altars erected in Athens one bearing the inscription, “To the unknown God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_23">Acts 17:23</span>), or rather “to an [i.e., some] unknown God.” The reason for this inscription cannot now be accurately determined. It afforded the apostle the occasion of proclaiming the gospel to the “men of Athens.” The first altar we read of is that erected by Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_20">Genesis 8:20</span>). Altars were erected by Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_7">Genesis 12:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_4">13:4</span>; 22:9), by Isaac (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_25">Genesis 26:25</span>), by Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN33_20">33:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_1,3">35:1, 3</span>), and by Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_15">Exodus 17:15</span>,“Jehovah-nissi”).<br>In the tabernacle, and afterwards in the temple, two altars were erected.<br>(1.) The altar of burnt offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_28">Exodus 30:28</span>), called also the “brasen altar” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_39">Exodus 39:39</span>) and “the table of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ML1_7">Malachi 1:7</span>).<br>This altar, as erected in the tabernacle, is described in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_1-8">Exodus 27:1-8</span>. It was a hollow square, 5 cubits in length and in breadth, and 3 cubits in height. It was made of shittim wood, and was overlaid with plates of brass.<br>Its corners were ornamented with “horns” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_12">Exodus 29:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_18">Leviticus 4:18</span>).<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_3">Exodus 27:3</span> the various utensils appertaining to the altar are enumerated. They were made of brass. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_13,14">1 Samuel 2:13, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_12">Leviticus 16:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU16_6,7">Numbers 16:6, 7</span>.) In Solomon’s temple the altar was of larger dimensions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_1">2 Chronicles 4:1</span>.<br>Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_22,64">1 Kings 8:22, 64</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_25">9:25</span>), and was made wholly of brass, covering a structure of stone or earth. This altar was renewed by Asa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R215_8">2 Chronicles 15:8</span>). It was removed by Ahaz (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_14">2 Kings 16:14</span>), and “cleansed” by Hezekiah, in the latter part of whose reign it was rebuilt. It was finally broken up and carried away by the Babylonians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_17">Jeremiah 52:17</span>).<br>After the return from captivity it was re-erected (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_3,6">Ezra 3:3, 6</span>) on the same place where it had formerly stood. (Comp. 1 Macc. <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER4_47">4:47</span>.) When Antiochus Epiphanes pillaged Jerusalem the altar of burnt offering was taken away.<br>Again the altar was erected by Herod, and remained in its place till the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans (70 A.D.).<br>The fire on the altar was not permitted to go out (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_9">Leviticus 6:9</span>).<br>In the Mosque of Omar, immediately underneath the great dome, which occupies the site of the old temple, there is a rough projection of the natural rock, of about 60 feet in its extreme length, and 50 in its greatest breadth, and in its highest part about 4 feet above the general pavement.<br>This rock seems to have been left intact when Solomon’s temple was built.<br>It was in all probability the site of the altar of burnt offering. Underneath this rock is a cave, which may probably have been the granary of Araunah’s threshing-floor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_22">1 Chronicles 21:22</span>).<br>(2.) The altar of incense (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_1-10">Exodus 30:1-10</span>), called also “the golden altar”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_38">39:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU4_11">Numbers 4:11</span>), stood in the holy place “before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony.” On this altar sweet spices were continually burned with fire taken from the brazen altar. The morning and the evening services were commenced by the high priest offering incense on this altar.<br>The burning of the incense was a type of prayer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS141_2">Psalm 141:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV5_8">Revelation 5:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV8_3,4">8:3, 4</span>).<br>This altar was a small movable table, made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX37_25,26">Exodus 37:25, 26</span>). It was 1 cubit in length and breadth, and 2 cubits in height.<br>In Solomon’s temple the altar was similar in size, but was made of cedar-wood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_20">1 Kings 6:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_48">7:48</span>) overlaid with gold. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK41_22">Ezekiel 41:22</span> it is called “the altar of wood.” (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_1-6">Exodus 30:1-6</span>.) In the temple built after the Exile the altar was restored. Antiochus Epiphanes took it away, but it was afterwards restored by Judas Maccabaeus (1 Macc. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX1_23">1:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_49">4:49</span>). Among the trophies carried away by Titus on the destruction of Jerusalem the altar of incense is not found, nor is any mention made of it in <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_">Hebrews 9</span>. It was at this altar Zacharias ministered when an angel appeared to him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_11">Luke 1:11</span>). It is the only altar which appears in the heavenly temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS6_6">Isaiah 6:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV8_3,4">Revelation 8:3,4</span>).<br>
