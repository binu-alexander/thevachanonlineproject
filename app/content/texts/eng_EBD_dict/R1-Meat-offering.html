This Hebrew word came latterly to denote an “unbloody” sacrifice, as opposed to a “bloody” sacrifice. A “drink-offering” generally accompanied it. The law regarding it is given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span>, and 6:14-23. It was a recognition of the sovereignty of God and of his bounty in giving all earthly blessings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_10-14">1 Chronicles 29:10-14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT26_5-11">Deuteronomy 26:5-11</span>). It was an offering which took for granted and was based on the offering for sin. It followed the sacrifice of blood. It was presented every day with the burnt-offering(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_40,41">Exodus 29:40, 41</span>), and consisted of flour or of cakes prepared in a special way with oil and frankincense.<br>
