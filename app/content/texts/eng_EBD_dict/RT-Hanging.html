Criminals were first strangled and then hanged (Nu. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_4">25:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_22">Deuteronomy 21:22</span>). (See 2 Samuel 21:6 for the practice of the Gibeonites.) Hanging (as a curtain). (1.) Hebrews masak, (a) before the entrance to the court of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_17">Exodus <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_17">35:17</span></span>); (b) before the door of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_36,37">26:36, 37</span>); (c) before the entrance to the most holy place, called “the veil of the covering” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_12">35:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_34">39:34</span>), as the word properly means.<br>(2.) Hebrews kelaim, tapestry covering the walls of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_9">Exodus 27:9</span>; 35:17; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_26">Numbers 3:26</span>) to the half of the height of the wall (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_18">Exodus 27:18</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_16">26:16</span>). These hangings were fastened to pillars.<br>(3.) Hebrews bottim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_7">2 Kings 23:7</span>), “hangings for the grove” (R.V., “for the Asherah”); marg., instead of “hangings,” has “tents” or “houses.” Such curtained structures for idolatrous worship are also alluded to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_16">Ezekiel 16:16</span>.<br>
