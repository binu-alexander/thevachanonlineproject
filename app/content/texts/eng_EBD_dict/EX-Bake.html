Common ovens were generally used; at other times a jar was half-filled with hot pebbles, and the dough was spread over them. Hence we read of “cakes baken on the coals” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_6">1 Kings 19:6</span>), and “baken in the oven” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_4">Leviticus 2:4</span>).
