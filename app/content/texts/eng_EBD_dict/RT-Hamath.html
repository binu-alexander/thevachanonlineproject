It is called “Hamath the great” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_2">Amos 6:2</span>, and “Hamath-zobah” in 2 Chronicles 8:3.<br>Hamath, now Hamah, had an Aramaean population, but Hittite monuments discovered there show that it must have been at one time occupied by the Hittites. It was among the conquests of the Pharaoh Thothmes III. Its king, Tou or Toi, made alliance with David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_10">2 Samuel 8:10</span>), and in B.C. 740 Azariah formed a league with it against Assyria. It was, however, conquered by the Assyrians, and its nineteen districts placed under Assyrian governors. In B.C. 720 it revolted under a certain Yahu-bihdi, whose name, compounded with that of the God of Israel(Yahu), perhaps shows that he was of Jewish origin. But the revolt was suppressed, and the people of Hamath were transported to Samaria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_24,30">2 Kings 17:24, 30</span>), where they continued to worship their God Ashima.<br>Hamah is beautifully situated on the Orontes, 32 miles north of Emesa, and 36 south of the ruins of Assamea.<br>The kingdom of Hamath comprehended the great plain lying on both banks of the Orontes from the fountain near Riblah to Assamea on the north, and from Lebanon on the west to the desert on the east. The “entrance of Hamath” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU34_8">Numbers 34:8</span>), which was the north boundary of Palestine, led from the west between the north end of Lebanon and the Nusairiyeh mountains.<br>
