After this solemn consecration of the twelve, he descended from the mountain-peak to a more level spot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_17">Luke 6:17</span>), and there he sat down and delivered the “sermon on the mount”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_-7">Matthew 5-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_20-49">Luke 6:20-49</span>) to the assembled multitude. The mountain here spoken of was probably that known by the name of the “Horns of Hattin” (Kurun Hattin), a ridge running east and west, not far from Capernaum. It was afterwards called the “Mount of Beatitudes.”
