The debtor was to deliver up as a pledge to the creditor what he could most easily dispense with (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_10,11">Deuteronomy 24:10, 11</span>).<br>(2.) A mill, or millstone, or upper garment, when given as a pledge, could not be kept over night (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_26,27">Exodus 22:26, 27</span>).<br>(3.) A debt could not be exacted during the Sabbatic year (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT15_1-15">Deuteronomy 15:1-15</span>).<br>For other laws bearing on this relation see <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_14,32,39">Leviticus 25:14, 32, 39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_25,34">Matthew 18:25, 34</span>.<br>(4.) A surety was liable in the same way as the original debtor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR11_15">Proverbs 11:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR17_18">17:18</span>).<br>
