The intention of Joseph was that the right hand of the aged patriarch should be placed on the head of the elder of the two; but Jacob set Ephraim the younger before his brother,“guiding his hands wittingly.” Before Joseph’s death, Ephraim’s family had reached the third generation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_23">Genesis 50:23</span>).<br>

In Joshua’s time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_18">Joshua 17:18</span>) these hills were densely wooded. They were intersected by well-watered, fertile valleys, referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_19">Jeremiah 50:19</span>. Joshua was buried at Timnath-heres among the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_9">Judges 2:9</span>). This region is also called the “mountains of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_21">Joshua 11:21</span>) and the “mountains of Samaria” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_5,6">Jeremiah 31:5, 6</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM3_9">Amos 3:9</span>).<br>

The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned separately (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_32-34">Numbers 1:32-34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_14,17">Joshua 17:14, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_20">1 Chronicles 7:20</span>).<br>Territory of. At the time of the first census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_32,33">Numbers 1:32, 33</span>); forty years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march (see CAMP) Ephraim’s place was on the west side of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_18-24">Numbers 2:18-24</span>). When the spies were sent out to spy the land, “Oshea the son of Nun” of this tribe signalized himself.<br>The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to Ephraim are given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS16_1-10">Joshua 16:1-10</span>. It included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. “For more than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed pre-eminence.<br>Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history that God ‘refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved’ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_67,68">Psalm 78:67, 68</span>). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled.” Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim’s jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent came to a crisis by Rehoboam’s refusal to grant certain redresses that were demanded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_">1 Kings 12</span>).<br>
