The order of the encampment (see CAMP) was preserved in the march (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_">Numbers 2</span>:17), the signal for which was the blast of two silver trumpets. Detailed regulations affecting the camp for sanitary purposes are given (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_11,12">Leviticus 4:11, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_11">6:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV8_17">8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_4,5">10:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_46">13:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV14_3">14:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_14,15">Numbers 12:14, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_19">31:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_10,12">Deuteronomy 23:10, 12</span>).<br>Criminals were executed without the camp (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_12">Leviticus 4:12</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_17,20">John 19:17, 20</span>), and there also the young bullock for a sin-offering was burnt(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_14">Leviticus 24:14</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_12">Hebrews 13:12</span>).<br>In the subsequent history of Israel frequent mention is made of their encampments in the time of war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_18">Judges 7:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_2,3,16,23">1 Samuel 13:2, 3, 16, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_3">17:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S129_1">29:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_9,24">30:9, 24</span>). The temple was sometimes called “the camp of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_2">2 Chronicles 31:2</span>, R.V.; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_28">Psalm 78:28</span>). The multitudes who flocked to David are styled “a great host (i.e., “camp;” Hebrews mahaneh), like the host of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_22">1 Chronicles 12:22</span>).<br>
