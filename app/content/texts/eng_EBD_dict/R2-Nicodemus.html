He is first noticed as visiting Jesus by night (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN3_1-21">John 3:1-21</span>) for the purpose of learning more of his doctrines, which our Lord then unfolded to him, giving prominence to the necessity of being “born again.” He is next met with in the Sanhedrin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_50-52">7:50-52</span>), where he protested against the course they were taking in plotting against Christ. Once more he is mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_39">John 19:39</span>). We hear nothing more of him. There can be little doubt that he became a true disciple.<br>
