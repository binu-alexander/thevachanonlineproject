Such persons enjoyed many privileges in common with the Jews, but still were separate from them. The relation of the Jews to strangers was regulated by special laws (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_3">Deuteronomy 23:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_14-21">24:14-21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_5">25:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT26_10-13">26:10-13</span>). A special signification is also sometimes attached to this word. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_4">Genesis 23:4</span> it denotes one resident in a foreign land; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_9">Exodus 23:9</span>, one who is not a Jew; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_10">Numbers 3:10</span>, one who is not of the family of Aaron; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS69_8">Psalm 69:8</span>, an alien or an unknown person. The Jews were allowed to purchase strangers as slaves (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_44,45">Leviticus 25:44, 45</span>), and to take usury from them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_20">Deuteronomy 23:20</span>).<br>
