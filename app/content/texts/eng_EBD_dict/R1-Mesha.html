A plain in that part of the boundaries of Arabia inhabited by the descendants of Joktan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_30">Genesis 10:30</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews meysh’a, “deliverance,” the eldest son of Caleb (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_42">1 Chronicles 2:42</span>), and brother of Jerahmeel.<br>(3.) Hebrews id, a king of Moab, the son of Chemosh-Gad, a man of great wealth in flocks and herds (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_4">2 Kings 3:4</span>). After the death of Ahab at Ramoth-Gilead, Mesha shook off the yoke of Israel; but on the ascension of Jehoram to the throne of Israel, that king sought the help of Jehoshaphat in an attempt to reduce the Moabites again to their former condition. The united armies of the two kings came unexpectedly on the army of the Moabites, and gained over them an easy victory. The whole land was devastated by the conquering armies, and Mesha sought refuge in his last stronghold, Kir-harasheth (q.v.). Reduced to despair, he ascended the wall of the city, and there, in the sight of the allied armies, offered his first-born son a sacrifice to Chemosh, the fire-God of the Moabites. This fearful spectacle filled the beholders with horror, and they retired from before the besieged city, and recrossed the Jordan laden with spoil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_25-27">2 Kings 3:25-27</span>).<br>The exploits of Mesha are recorded in the Phoenician inscription on a block of black basalt found at Dibon, in Moab, usually called the “Moabite stone” (q.v.).<br>
