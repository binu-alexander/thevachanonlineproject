Its inhabitants were fond of novelty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_21">Acts 17:21</span>), and were remarkable for their zeal in the worship of the gods. It was a sarcastic saying of the Roman satirist that it was “easier to find a God at Athens than a man.” On his second missionary journey Paul visited this city (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_15">Acts 17:15</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="H13_1">1 Thessalonians 3:1</span>), and delivered in the Areopagus his famous speech (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H117_22-31">17:22-31</span>). The altar of which Paul there speaks as dedicated “to the [properly “an”] unknown God” (23) was probably one of several which bore the same inscription. It is supposed that they originated in the practice of letting loose a flock of sheep and goats in the streets of Athens on the occasion of a plague, and of offering them up in sacrifice, at the spot where they lay down, “to the God concerned.”
