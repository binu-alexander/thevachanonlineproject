The flag or banner of the larger kind, serving for three tribes marching together. These standards, of which there were four, were worked with embroidery and beautifully ornamented (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_52">Numbers 1:52</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_2,3,10,18,25">2:2, 3, 10, 18, 25</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS2_4">2:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_4,10">6:4, 10</span>).<br>(2.) The flag borne by each separate tribe, of a smaller form. Probably it bore on it the name of the tribe to which it belonged, or some distinguishing device (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_2,34">Numbers 2:2,34</span>).<br>(3.) A lofty signal-flag, not carried about, but stationary. It was usually erected on a mountain or other lofty place. As soon as it was seen the war-trumpets were blown (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS60_4">Psalm <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS60_4">60:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_26">Isaiah 5:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_12">11:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_2">13:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_3">18:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_17">30:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_621">Jeremiah 4:6 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_7">Ezekiel 27:7</span>).<br>(4.) A “sign of fire” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR6_1">Jeremiah 6:1</span>) was sometimes used as a signal.<br>The banners and ensigns of the Roman army had idolatrous images upon them, and hence they are called the “abomination of desolation” (q.v.). The principal Roman standard, however, was an eagle. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_28">Matthew 24:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK17_37">Luke 17:37</span>, where the Jewish nation is compared to a dead body, which the eagles gather together to devour.) God’s setting up or giving a banner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS20_5">Psalm 20:5</span>; 60:4; Cant. 2:4) imports his presence and protection and aid extended to his people.<br>
