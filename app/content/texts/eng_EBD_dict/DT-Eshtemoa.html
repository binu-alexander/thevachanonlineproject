It was frequented by David and his followers during their wanderings; and he sent presents of the spoil of the Amalekites to his friends there (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_28">1 Samuel 30:28</span>). It is identified with es-Semu’a, a village about 3 1/2 miles east of Socoh, and 7 or 8 miles south of Hebron, around which there are ancient remains of the ruined city. It is the centre of the“south country” or Negeb. It is also called “Eshtemoh” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_50">Joshua 15:50</span>).<br>
