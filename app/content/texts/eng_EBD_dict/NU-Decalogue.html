These commandments were at first written on two stone slabs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX31_18">31:18</span>), which were broken by Moses throwing them down on the ground (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_19">32:19</span>). They were written by God a second time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_1">34:1</span>). The decalogue is alluded to in the New Testament five times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_17,18,19">Matthew 5:17, 18, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_19">Mark 10:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_20">Luke 18:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM7_7,8">Romans 7:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM13_9">13:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_9,10">1 Timothy 1:9, 10</span>).<br>These commandments have been divided since the days of Origen the Greek father, as they stand in the Confession of all the Reformed Churches except the Lutheran. The division adopted by Luther, and which has ever since been received in the Lutheran Church, makes the first two commandments one, and the third the second, and so on to the last, which is divided into two. “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house” being ranked as ninth, and “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife,” etc., the tenth. (See COMMANDMENTS.)
