As baking was a daily necessity, grain was also ground daily at the mills (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_10">Jeremiah 25:10</span>). The flour mingled with water was kneaded in kneading-troughs, and sometimes leaven (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_34">Exodus 12:34</span>) was added and sometimes omitted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_3">Genesis 19:3</span>). The dough was then formed into thin cakes nine or ten inches in diameter and baked in the oven.<br>Fine flour was offered by the poor as a sin-offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_11-13">Leviticus 5:11-13</span>), and also in connection with other sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_3-12">Numbers 15:3-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_7-29">28:7-29</span>).<br>
