But in the time of our Lord, and perhaps even from the days of Amos (6:4, 7), the foreign custom had been largely introduced of having broad couches, forming three sides of a small square, the guests reclining at ease on their elbows during meals, with their faces to the space within, up and down which servants passed offering various dishes, or in the absence of servants, helping themselves from dishes laid on a table set between the couches.” Geikie’s Life of Christ. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>.) (See ABRAHAM’S BOSOM; BANQUET; FEAST.)
