Although not now found in Palestine, they must have been in ancient times very numerous there. They had their lairs in the forests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR5_6">Jeremiah 5:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR12_8">12:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM3_4">Amos 3:4</span>), in the caves of the mountains (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM4_8">4:8</span>; Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM2_12">2:12</span>), and in the canebrakes on the banks of the Jordan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_19">Jeremiah 49:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_44">50:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC11_3">Zechariah 11:3</span>).<br>No fewer than at least six different words are used in the Old Testament for the lion.<br>(1.) Gor (i.e., a “suckling”), the lion’s whelp (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9">Genesis 49:9</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_38">Jeremiah 51:38</span>, etc.).<br>(2.) Kephir (i.e., “shaggy”), the young lion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_5">Judges 14:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_10">Job 4:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_13">Psalm 91:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_21">104:21</span>), a term which is also used figuratively of cruel enemies(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_10">Psalm 34:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS35_17">35:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS58_6">58:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_15">Jeremiah 2:15</span>).<br>(3.) ’Ari (i.e., the “puller” in pieces), denoting the lion in general, without reference to age or sex (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_24"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_24">Numbers 23:24</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_10">2 Samuel 17:10</span></span>, etc.).<br>(4.) Shahal (the “roarer”), the mature lion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_10">Job 4:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_13">Psalm 91:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR26_13">Proverbs 26:13</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR5_14">5:14</span>).<br>(5.) Laish, so called from its strength and bravery (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_11">Job 4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_30">Proverbs 30:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_6">Isaiah 30:6</span>). The capital of Northern Dan received its name from this word.<br>(6.) Labi, from a root meaning “to roar,” a grown lion or lioness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9">Genesis 49:9</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_24"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_24">Numbers 23:24</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_9">24:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK19_2">Ezekiel 19:2</span>; Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK2_11">2:11</span>).<br>The lion of Palestine was properly of the Asiatic variety, distinguished from the African variety, which is larger. Yet it not only attacked flocks in the presence of the shepherd, but also laid waste towns and villages (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_25,26">2 Kings 17:25, 26</span>) and devoured men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K113_24,25">1 Kings 13:24, 25</span>). Shepherds sometimes, single-handed, encountered lions and slew them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_34,35">1 Samuel 17:34, 35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM3_12">Amos 3:12</span>). Samson seized a young lion with his hands and“rent him as he would have rent a kid” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_5">Judges 14:5</span>, 6). The strength(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_18">Judges 14:18</span>), courage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_10">2 Samuel 17:10</span></span>), and ferocity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_9">Genesis 49:9</span></span></span>) of the lion were proverbial.<br>
