He is also known by the Persian name of Sheshbazzar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER1_8,11">Ezra 1:8, 11</span>). In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, he led the first band of Jews, numbering 42,360 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_64">Ezra 2:64</span>), exclusive of a large number of servants, who returned from captivity at the close of the seventy years. In the second year after the Return, he erected an altar and laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_8-13">3:8-13</span>; ch. 4-6). All through the work he occupied a prominent place, inasmuch as he was a descendant of the royal line of David.<br>
