Sometimes, though but rarely, it is spoken of as used for peaceful purposes.<br>The first mention of the chariot is when Joseph, as a mark of distinction, was placed in Pharaoh’s second state chariot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_43">Genesis 41:43</span>); and the next, when he went out in his own chariot to meet his father Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_29">46:29</span>).<br>Chariots formed part of the funeral procession of Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_9">50:9</span>). When Pharaoh pursued the Israelites he took 600 war-chariots with him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_7">Exodus 14:7</span></span>). The Canaanites in the valleys of Palestine had chariots of iron(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_18">Joshua 17:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_19">Judges 1:19</span>). Jabin, the king of Canaan, had 900 chariots(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_3">Judges 4:3</span>); and in Saul’s time the Philistines had 30,000. In his wars with the king of Zobah and with the Syrians, David took many chariots among the spoils (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_4">2 Samuel 8:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_18">10:18</span>). Solomon maintained as part of his army 1,400 chariots (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_26">1 Kings 10:26</span>), which were chiefly imported from Egypt(29). From this time forward they formed part of the armies of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_34">1 Kings 22:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_16,21">2 Kings 9:16, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_7,14">13:7, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_24">18:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_30">23:30</span>).<br>In the New Testament we have only one historical reference to the use of chariots, in the case of the Ethiopian eunuch (Acts. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_28,29,38">8:28, 29, 38</span>).<br>This word is sometimes used figuratively for hosts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_17">Psalm 68:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_17">2 Kings 6:17</span></span>). Elijah, by his prayers and his counsel, was “the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.” The rapid agency of God in the phenomena of nature is also spoken of under the similitude of a chariot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_3">Psalm 104:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS66_15">Isaiah 66:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HK3_8">Habakkuk 3:8</span>).<br>Chariot of the cherubim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R128_18">1 Chronicles 28:18</span>), the chariot formed by the two cherubs on the mercy-seat on which the Lord rides.<br>Chariot cities were set apart for storing the war-chariots in time of peace(<span class="bibleref" data-id="R21_14">2 Chronicles 1:14</span>).<br>Chariot horses were such as were peculiarly fitted for service in chariots (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K27_14">2 Kings 7:14</span>).<br>Chariots of war are described in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_7">Exodus 14:7</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_5">1 Samuel 13:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_4">2 Samuel 8:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_4">1 Chronicles 18:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_4">Joshua 11:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_3">Judges 4:3</span>, 13. They were not used by the Israelites till the time of David. Elijah was translated in a “chariot of fire”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_11">2 Kings 2:11</span>). Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_17">2 Kings 6:17</span></span>. This vision would be to Elisha a source of strength and encouragement, for now he could say, “They that be with us are more than they that be with them.”
