(2.) It was afterwards transitively applied to each of the four histories of our Lord’s life, published by those who are therefore called ‘Evangelists’, writers of the history of the gospel (the evangelion).<br>(3.) The term is often used to express collectively the gospel doctrines; and‘preaching the gospel’ is often used to include not only the proclaiming of the good tidings, but the teaching men how to avail themselves of the offer of salvation, the declaring of all the truths, precepts, promises, and threatenings of Christianity.” It is termed “the gospel of the grace of God”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_24">Acts 20:24</span>), “the gospel of the kingdom” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_23">Matthew 4:23</span>), “the gospel of Christ” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM1_16">Romans 1:16</span>), “the gospel of peace (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_15">Ephesians 6:15</span>), “the glorious gospel,” “the everlasting gospel,” “the gospel of salvation”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_13">Ephesians 1:13</span>).<br>
