It was governed by a propraetor with the title of proconsul. Paul was summoned by the vision of the “man of Macedonia” to preach the gospel there (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_9">Acts 16:9</span>). Frequent allusion is made to this event (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_5">18:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_21">19:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM15_26">Romans 15:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C21_16">2 Corinthians 1:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_9">11:9</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C24_15">4:15</span>).<br>The history of Paul’s first journey through Macedonia is given in detail in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_10-17">Acts 16:10-17</span>:15. At the close of this journey he returned from Corinth to Syria. He again passed through this country (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_1-6">20:1-6</span>), although the details of the route are not given. After many years he probably visited it for a third time (Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_24">2:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_3">1 Timothy 1:3</span>). The first convert made by Paul in Europe was (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_13-15">Acts 16:13-15</span>) Lydia (q.v.), a “seller of purple,” residing in Philippi, the chief city of the eastern division of Macedonia.<br>
