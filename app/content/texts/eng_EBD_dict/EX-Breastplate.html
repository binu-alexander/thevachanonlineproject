That piece of ancient armour that protected the breast. This word is used figuratively in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_14">Ephesians 6:14</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS59_17">Isaiah 59:17</span>.<br>(See ARMOUR.)(2.) An ornament covering the breast of the high priest, first mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_7">Exodus 25:7</span>. It was made of embroidered cloth, set with four rows of precious stones, three in each row. On each stone was engraved the name of one of the twelve tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_15-29">Exodus <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_15">28:15</span>-29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_8-21">39:8-21</span>). It was in size about ten inches square. The two upper corners were fastened to the ephod by blue ribbons. It was not to be “loosed from the ephod” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_28">Exodus 28:28</span>). The lower corners were fastened to the girdle of the priest. As it reminded the priest of his representative character, it was called the memorial (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_29">28:29</span>). It was also called the breastplate of judgment (28:15).<br>(See PRIEST.)
