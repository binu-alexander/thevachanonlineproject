Hebrews homit, among the unclean creeping things (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_30">Leviticus 11:30</span>). This was probably the sand-lizard, of which there are many species in the wilderness of Judea and the Sinai peninsula.<br>(2.) Hebrews shablul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS58_8">Psalm 58:8</span>), the snail or slug proper. Tristram explains the allusions of this passage by a reference to the heat and drought by which the moisture of the snail is evaporated. “We find,” he says, “in all parts of the Holy Land myriads of snail-shells in fissures still adhering by the calcareous exudation round their orifice to the surface of the rock, but the animal of which is utterly shrivelled and wasted, ‘melted away.’”
