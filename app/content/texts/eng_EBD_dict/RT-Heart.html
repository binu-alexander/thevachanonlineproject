</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Heart" ><div class="is"><b>HEART</b></div><br>"HEART" According to the Bible, the heart is the centre not only of spiritual activity, but of all the operations of human life. “Heart” and“soul” are often used interchangeably (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT6_5">Deuteronomy 6:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT26_16">26:16</span>; comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_37">Matthew 22:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK12_30,33">Mark 12:30, 33</span>), but this is not generally the case.<br>The heart is the “home of the personal life,” and hence a man is designated, according to his heart, wise (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K13_12">1 Kings 3:12</span>, etc.), pure (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS24_4">Psalm 24:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_8">Matthew 5:8</span>, etc.), upright and righteous (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_5,6">Genesis 20:5, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS11_2">Psalm 11:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_72">78:72</span>), pious and good (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK8_15">Luke 8:15</span>), etc. In these and such passages the word “soul” could not be substituted for “heart.” The heart is also the seat of the conscience (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM2_15">Romans 2:15</span>). It is naturally wicked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_21">Genesis 8:21</span>), and hence it contaminates the whole life and character (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_34">Matthew 12:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_18">15:18</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC8_11">Ecclesiastes 8:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS73_7">Psalm 73:7</span>).<br>Hence the heart must be changed, regenerated (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK36_26">Ezekiel 36:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK11_19">11:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_10-14">Psalm 51:10-14</span>), before a man can willingly obey God.<br>The process of salvation begins in the heart by the believing reception of the testimony of God, while the rejection of that testimony hardens the heart (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS95_8">Psalm 95:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR28_14">Proverbs 28:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R236_13">2 Chronicles 36:13</span>). “Hardness of heart evidences itself by light views of sin; partial acknowledgment and confession of it; pride and conceit; ingratitude; unconcern about the word and ordinances of God; inattention to divine providences; stifling convictions of conscience; shunning reproof; presumption, and general ignorance of divine things.”
