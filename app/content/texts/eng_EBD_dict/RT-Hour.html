It is the rendering of the Chaldee shaah, meaning a “moment,” a “look.” It is used in the New Testament frequently to denote some determinate season (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_13">Matthew 8:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_39">Luke 12:39</span>).<br>With the ancient Hebrews the divisions of the day were “morning, evening, and noon-day” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS55_17">Psalm 55:17</span>, etc.). The Greeks, following the Babylonians, divided the day into twelve hours. The Jews, during the Captivity, learned also from the Babylonians this method of dividing time.<br>When Judea became subject to the Romans, the Jews adopted the Roman mode of reckoning time. The night was divided into four watches (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_38">Luke 12:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_25">Matthew 14:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_25">13:25</span>). Frequent allusion is also made to hours(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_13">Matthew 25:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_40">26:40</span>, etc.). (See DAY.) An hour was the twelfth part of the day, reckoning from sunrise to sunset, and consequently it perpetually varied in length.<br>
