This custom, along with the use of raised tables like ours, was introduced among the Jews after the Captivity.<br>Before this they had, properly speaking, no table. That which served the purpose was a skin or piece of leather spread out on the carpeted floor.<br>Sometimes a stool was placed in the middle of this skin. (See ABRAHAMâ€™S BOSOM; BANQUET; MEALS.)
