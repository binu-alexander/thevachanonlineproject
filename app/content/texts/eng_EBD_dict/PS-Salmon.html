In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_14">Psalm 68:14</span> the change from war to peace is likened to snow on the dark mountain, as some interpret the expression.<br>Others suppose the words here mean that the bones of the slain left unburied covered the land, so that it seemed to be white as if covered with snow. The reference, however, of the psalm is probably to <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_">Joshua 11</span> and 12. The scattering of the kings and their followers is fitly likened unto the snow-flakes rapidly falling on the dark Salmon. It is the modern Jebel Suleiman.<br>
