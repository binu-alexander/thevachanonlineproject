He came to Ephesus(about A.D. 49), where he spake “boldly” in the synagogue (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_26">18:26</span>), although he did not know as yet that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah.<br>Aquila and Priscilla instructed him more perfectly in “the way of God”, i.e., in the knowledge of Christ. He then proceeded to Corinth, where he met Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_27">Acts 18:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_1">19:1</span>). He was there very useful in watering the good seed Paul had sown (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C11_12">1 Corinthians 1:12</span>), and in gaining many to Christ.<br>His disciples were much attached to him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_4-7,22">1 Corinthians 3:4-7, 22</span>). He was with Paul at Ephesus when he wrote the First Epistle to the Corinthians; and Paul makes kindly reference to him in his letter to Titus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_13">3:13</span>). Some have supposed, although without sufficient ground, that he was the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews.<br>
