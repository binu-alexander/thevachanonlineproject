A place in the extreme south of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_23">Joshua 15:23</span>). Probably the same as Kadesh-barnea (q.v.).<br>(2.) A city of Issachar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_72">1 Chronicles 6:72</span>). Possibly Tell Abu Kadeis, near Lejjun.<br>(3.) A “fenced city” of Naphtali, one of the cities of refuge (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_37">Joshua 19:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_6">Judges 4:6</span></span>). It was assigned to the Gershonite Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_32">Joshua 21:32</span>). It was originally a Canaanite royal city (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_22">Joshua 12:22</span>), and was the residence of Barak (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_6">Judges 4:6</span></span>); and here he and Deborah assembled the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali before the commencement of the conflict with Sisera in the plain of Esdraelon, “for Jehovah among the mighty” (9, 10). In the reign of Pekah it was taken by Tiglath-Pileser (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_29">2 Kings 15:29</span>). It was situated near the “plain” (rather “the oak”) of Zaanaim, and has been identified with the modern Kedes, on the hills fully four miles north-west of Lake El Huleh.<br>It has been supposed by some that the Kedesh of the narrative, where Barak assembled his troops, was not the place in Upper Galilee so named, which was 30 miles distant from the plain of Esdraelon, but Kedish, on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, 12 miles from Tabor.<br>
