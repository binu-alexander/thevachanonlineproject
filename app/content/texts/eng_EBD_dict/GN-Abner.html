He was commander-in-chief of Saul’s army (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_50">1 Samuel 14:50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_55">17:55</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S120_25">20:25</span>). He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_57">1 Samuel 17:57</span>). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_8">2 Samuel 2:8</span>). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth’s army, was fought with David’s army under Joab at Gibeon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_12">2 Samuel 2:12</span>). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was “light of foot as a wild roe,” the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_18-32">2 Samuel 2: 18-32</span>).<br>Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_27,31-39">2 Samuel 3:27, 31-39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S24_12">4:12</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_5,32">1 Kings 2:5, 32</span>). David lamented in pathetic words the death of Abner, “Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_33-38">2 Samuel 3:33-38</span>.)
