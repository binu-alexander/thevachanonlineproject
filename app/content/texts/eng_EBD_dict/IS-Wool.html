The first-fruit of wool was to be offered to the priests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_4">Deuteronomy 18:4</span>). The law prohibiting the wearing of a garment“of divers sorts, as of woollen and linen together” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11">Deuteronomy 22:11</span>) may, like some other laws of a similar character, have been intended to express symbolically the separateness and simplicity of God’s covenant people. The wool of Damascus, famous for its whiteness, was of great repute in the Tyrian market (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_18">Ezekiel 27:18</span>).<br>
