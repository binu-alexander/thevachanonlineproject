Throughout the Gospels the word “praitorion” has this meaning (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_35">Acts 23:35</span>).<br>Pilate’s official residence when he was in Jerusalem was probably a part of the fortress of Antonia.<br>The trial of our Lord was carried on in a room or office of the palace. The“whole band” spoken of by Mark were gathered together in the palace court.<br>
