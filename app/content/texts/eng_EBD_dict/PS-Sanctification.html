In other words, sanctification is the carrying on to perfection the work begun in regeneration, and it extends to the whole man (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM6_13">Romans 6:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C24_6">2 Corinthians 4:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_10">Colossians 3:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J14_7">1 John 4:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_19">1 Corinthians 6:19</span>). It is the special office of the Holy Spirit in the plan of redemption to carry on this work (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span>). Faith is instrumental in securing sanctification, inasmuch as it (1) secures union to Christ(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_20">Galatians 2:20</span>), and (2) brings the believer into living contact with the truth, whereby he is led to yield obedience “to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come.” Perfect sanctification is not attainable in this life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_46">1 Kings 8:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR20_9">Proverbs 20:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC7_20">Ecclesiastes 7:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM3_2">James 3:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J11_8">1 John 1:8</span>). See Paul’s account of himself in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM7_14-25">Romans 7:14-25</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM3_12-14">3:12-14</span>; and 1 Timothy 1:15; also the confessions of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_12,13">Psalm 19:12, 13</span>; 51), of Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS90_8">90:8</span>), of Job (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS42_5,6">42:5, 6</span>), and of Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_3-20">9:3-20</span>). “The more holy a man is, the more humble, self-renouncing, self-abhorring, and the more sensitive to every sin he becomes, and the more closely he clings to Christ. The moral imperfections which cling to him he feels to be sins, which he laments and strives to overcome. Believers find that their life is a constant warfare, and they need to take the kingdom of heaven by storm, and watch while they pray. They are always subject to the constant chastisement of their Father’s loving hand, which can only be designed to correct their imperfections and to confirm their graces. And it has been notoriously the fact that the best Christians have been those who have been the least prone to claim the attainment of perfection for themselves.”, Hodge’s Outlines.<br>
