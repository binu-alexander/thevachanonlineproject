Hebrews pattish, used by gold-beaters (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS41_7">Isaiah 41:7</span>) and by quarry-men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR23_29">Jeremiah 23:29</span>). Metaphorically of Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_23">Jeremiah 50:23</span>) or Nebuchadnezzar.<br>(2.) Hebrews makabah, a stone-cutter’s mallet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_7">1 Kings 6:7</span>), or of any workman (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_21">Judges 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_12">Isaiah 44:12</span>).<br>(3.) Hebrews halmuth, a poetical word for a workman’s hammer, found only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_26">Judges 5:26</span>, where it denotes the mallet with which the pins of the tent of the nomad are driven into the ground.<br>(4.) Hebrews mappets, rendered “battle-axe” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_20">Jeremiah 51:20</span>. This was properly a “mace,” which is thus described by Rawlinson: “The Assyrian mace was a short, thin weapon, and must either have been made of a very tough wood or (and this is more probable) of metal. It had an ornamented head, which was sometimes very beautifully modelled, and generally a strap or string at the lower end by which it could be grasped with greater firmness.”
