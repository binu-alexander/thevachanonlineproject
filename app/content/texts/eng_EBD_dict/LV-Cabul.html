A town on the eastern border of Asher (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_27">Joshua 19:27</span>), probably one of the towns given by Solomon to Hiram; the modern Kabul, some 8 miles east of Accho, on the very borders of Galilee.<br>(2.) A district in the north-west of Galilee, near to Tyre, containing twenty cities given to Hiram by Solomon as a reward for various services rendered to him in building the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_13">1 Kings 9:13</span>), and as payment of the six score talents of gold he had borrowed from him. Hiram gave the cities this name because he was not pleased with the gift, the name signifying “good for nothing.” Hiram seems afterwards to have restored these cities to Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R28_2">2 Chronicles 8:2</span>).<br>
