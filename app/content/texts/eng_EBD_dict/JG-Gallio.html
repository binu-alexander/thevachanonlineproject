He was “deputy”, i.e., proconsul, as in Revised Version, of Achaia, under the emperor Claudius, when Paul visited Corinth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_12">Acts 18:12</span>). The word used here by Luke in describing the rank of Gallio shows his accuracy. Achaia was a senatorial province under Claudius, and the governor of such a province was called a“proconsul.” He is spoken of by his contemporaries as “sweet Gallio,” and is described as a most popular and affectionate man. When the Jews brought Paul before his tribunal on the charge of persuading “men to worship God contrary to the law” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_13">18:13</span>), he refused to listen to them, and “drave them from the judgment seat” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_16">18:16</span>).<br>
