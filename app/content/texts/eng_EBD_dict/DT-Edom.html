The name of Esau (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_30">Genesis 25:30</span>, “Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage [Hebrews haadom, haadom, i.e., ‘the red pottage, the red pottage’]...Therefore was his name called Edom”, i.e., Red.<br>(2.) Idumea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_5,6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_5,6">Isaiah 34:5, 6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK35_15">Ezekiel 35:15</span>). “The field of Edom” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_3">Genesis 32:3</span>), “the land of Edom” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_">Genesis 36</span>:16</span>), was mountainous (Obad. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_8,9,19,21">1:8, 9, 19, 21</span>). It was called the land, or “the mountain of Seir,” the rough hills on the east side of the Arabah. It extended from the head of the Gulf of Akabah, the Elanitic gulf, to the foot of the Dead Sea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26">1 Kings 9:26</span></span>), and contained, among other cities, the rock-hewn Sela (q.v.), generally known by the Greek name Petra (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_7">2 Kings 14:7</span>). It is a wild and rugged region, traversed by fruitful valleys. Its old capital was Bozrah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS63_1">Isaiah 63:1</span>). The early inhabitants of the land were Horites. They were destroyed by the Edomites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_12">Deuteronomy 2:12</span>), between whom and the kings of Israel and Judah there was frequent war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_20">2 Kings 8:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R228_17">2 Chronicles 28:17</span>).<br>At the time of the Exodus they churlishly refused permission to the Israelites to pass through their land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_14-21">Numbers 20:14-21</span>), and ever afterwards maintained an attitude of hostility toward them. They were conquered by David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_14">2 Samuel 8:14</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26">1 Kings 9:26</span></span>), and afterwards by Amaziah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_11,12">2 Chronicles 25:11, 12</span>). But they regained again their independence, and in later years, during the decline of the Jewish kingdom(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_6">2 Kings 16:6</span>; R.V. marg., “Edomites”), made war against Israel. They took part with the Chaldeans when Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, and afterwards they invaded and held possession of the south of Palestine as far as Hebron. At length, however, Edom fell under the growing Chaldean power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR27_3,6">Jeremiah 27:3, 6</span>).<br>There are many prophecies concerning Edom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_5,6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_5,6">Isaiah 34:5, 6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_7-18">Jeremiah 49:7-18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_13">Ezekiel 25:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK35_1-15">35:1-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_19">Joel 3:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_11">Amos 1:11</span>; Obad.; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ML1_3,4">Malachi 1:3, 4</span>) which have been remarkably fulfilled. The present desolate condition of that land is a standing testimony to the inspiration of these prophecies.<br>After an existence as a people for above seventeen hundred years, they have utterly disappeared, and their language even is forgotten for ever. In Petra, “where kings kept their court, and where nobles assembled, there no man dwells; it is given by lot to birds, and beasts, and reptiles.” The Edomites were Semites, closely related in blood and in language to the Israelites. They dispossessed the Horites of Mount Seir; though it is clear, from <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_">Genesis 36</span>, that they afterwards intermarried with the conquered population. Edomite tribes settled also in the south of Judah, like the Kenizzites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_">Genesis 36</span>:11), to whom Caleb and Othniel belonged (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_17">Joshua 15:17</span>). The southern part of Edom was known as Teman.<br>
