The Mosaic legislation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_35">Leviticus 25:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT15_7">Deuteronomy 15:7</span>) tended to promote a spirit of charity, and to prevent the occurrence of destitution among the people. Such passages as these, <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_1">Psalm 41:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS112_9">112:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR14_31">Proverbs 14:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_2">Isaiah 10:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM2_7">Amos 2:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR5_28">Jeremiah 5:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK22_29">Ezekiel 22:29</span>, would also naturally foster the same benevolent spirit.<br>In the time of our Lord begging was common (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_46">Mark 10:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC3_2">Acts 3:2</span>). The Pharisees were very ostentatious in their almsgivings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_2">Matthew 6:2</span>). The spirit by which the Christian ought to be actuated in this duty is set forth in 1 <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN3_17">John 3:17</span>. A regard to the state of the poor and needy is enjoined as a Christian duty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_11">Luke 3:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_30">6:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_1">Matthew 6:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_36">Acts 9:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_2,4">10:2, 4</span>), a duty which was not neglected by the early Christians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_13">Luke 14:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_35">Acts 20:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_10">Galatians 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM15_25-27">Romans 15:25-27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C116_1-4">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</span>). They cared not only for the poor among themselves, but contributed also to the necessities of those at a distance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_29">Acts 11:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC24_17">24:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C29_12">2 Corinthians 9:12</span>). Our Lord and his attendants showed an example also in this (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN13_29">John 13:29</span>).<br>In modern times the “poor-laws” have introduced an element which modifies considerably the form in which we may discharge this Christian duty.<br>
