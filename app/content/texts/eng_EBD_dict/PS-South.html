In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB37_9">Job 37:9</span> the word “south” is literally “chamber,” used here in the sense of treasury (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_22">38:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS135_7">Psalm 135:7</span>). This verse is rendered in the Revised Version “out of the chamber of the south.”
