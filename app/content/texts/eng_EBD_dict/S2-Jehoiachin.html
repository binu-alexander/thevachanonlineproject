He is also called Jeconiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR24_1">Jeremiah 24:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR27_20">27:20</span>, etc.), and Coniah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_24">22:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR37_1">37:1</span>).<br>He was succeeded by his uncle, Mattaniah = Zedekiah (q.v.). He was the last direct heir to the Jewish crown. He was carried captive to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, along with the flower of the nobility, all the leading men in Jerusalem, and a great body of the general population, some thirteen thousand in all (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_12-16">2 Kings 24:12-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_28">Jeremiah 52:28</span>). After an imprisonment of thirty-seven years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_31,33">Jeremiah 52:31, 33</span>), he was liberated by Evil-merodach, and permitted to occupy a place in the king’s household and sit at his table, receiving “every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_32-34">52:32-34</span>).<br>
