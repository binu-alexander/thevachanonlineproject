The bay in which it was wrecked now bears the name of “St.<br>Paul’s Bay”, “a certain creek with a shore.” It is about 2 miles deep and 1 broad, and the whole physical condition of the scene answers the description of the shipwreck given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_">Acts 28</span>. It was originally colonized by Phoenicians (“barbarians,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_2">28:2</span>). It came into the possession of the Greeks (B.C. 736), from whom it was taken by the Carthaginians (B.C.<br>528). In B.C. 242 it was conquered by the Romans, and was governed by a Roman propraetor at the time of the shipwreck (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_">Acts 28</span>:7). Since 1800, when the French garrison surrendered to the English force, it has been a British dependency. The island is about 17 miles long and 9 wide, and about 60 in circumference. After a stay of three months on this island, during which the “barbarians” showed them no little kindness, Julius procured for himself and his company a passage in another Alexandrian corn-ship which had wintered in the island, in which they proceeded on their voyage to Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_">Acts 28</span>:13, 14).<br>
