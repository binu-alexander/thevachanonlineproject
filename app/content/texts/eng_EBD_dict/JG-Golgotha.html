It is interpreted by the evangelists as meaning “the place of a skull”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_33">Matthew 27:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_22">Mark 15:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_17">John 19:17</span>). This name represents in Greek letters the Aramaic word Gulgaltha, which is the Hebrew Gulgoleth(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_2">Numbers 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_3,24">1 Chronicles 23:3, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_35">2 Kings 9:35</span>), meaning “a skull.” It is identical with the word Calvary (q.v.). It was a little knoll rounded like a bare skull. It is obvious from the evangelists that it was some well-known spot outside the gate (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_12">Hebrews 13:12</span>), and near the city (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_26">Luke 23:26</span>), containing a “garden” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_41">John 19:41</span>), and on a thoroughfare leading into the country. Hence it is an untenable idea that it is embraced within the present “Church of the Holy Sepulchre.” The hillock above Jeremiah’s Grotto, to the north of the city, is in all probability the true site of Calvary. The skull-like appearance of the rock in the southern precipice of the hillock is very remarkable.<br>
