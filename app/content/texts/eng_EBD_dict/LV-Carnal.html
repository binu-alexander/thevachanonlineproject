They are represented as of a “carnal mind, which is enmity against God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_6,7">Romans 8:6, 7</span>). Enjoyments that minister to the wants and desires of man’s animal nature are so called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM15_27">Romans 15:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C19_11">1 Corinthians 9:11</span>). The ceremonial of the Mosaic law is spoken of as “carnal,” because it related to things outward, the bodies of men and of animals, and the purification of the flesh(<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB7_16">Hebrews 7:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_10">9:10</span>). The weapons of Christian warfare are “not carnal”, that is, they are not of man’s device, nor are wielded by human power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C210_4">2 Corinthians 10:4</span>).<br>
