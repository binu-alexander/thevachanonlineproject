For example, the case of the leper (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_,14">Leviticus 13, 14</span>), and of the house defiled by leprosy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV14_49-53">14:49-53</span>; see also <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_2-4">Matthew 8:2-4</span>). Uncleanness from touching a dead body (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU19_11">Numbers 19:11</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_4">9:4</span>; Hag. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_13">2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_27">Matthew 23:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK11_44">Luke 11:44</span>).
