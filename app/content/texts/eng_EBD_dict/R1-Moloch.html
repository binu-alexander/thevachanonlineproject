He was the consuming and destroying and also at the same time the purifying fire. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM5_26">Amos 5:26</span>,“your Moloch” of the Authorized Version is “your king” in the Revised Version (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_43">Acts 7:43</span>). Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7">1 Kings 11:7</span>) erected a high place for this idol on the Mount of Olives, and from that time till the days of Josiah his worship continued (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_10,13">2 Kings 23:10, 13</span>). In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially restored, but after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called Molech (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV18_21">Leviticus 18:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_2-5">20:2-5</span>, etc.), Milcom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_5,33">1 Kings 11:5, 33</span>, etc.), and Malcham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_5">Zephaniah 1:5</span>). This God became Chemosh among the Moabites.<br>
