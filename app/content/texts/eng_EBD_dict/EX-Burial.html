The first commercial transaction recorded is that of the purchase of a burial-place, for which Abraham weighed to Ephron “four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchants.” Thus the patriarch became the owner of a part of the land of Canaan, the only part he ever possessed.<br>When he himself died, “his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah,” beside Sarah his wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_9">Genesis 25:9</span>).<br>Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, was buried under Allon-bachuth, “the oak of weeping” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_8">Genesis 35:8</span>), near to Bethel. Rachel died, and was buried near Ephrath; “and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave” (16-20). Isaac was buried at Hebron, where he had died (27, 29). Jacob, when charging his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, said, “There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_31">49:31</span>). In compliance with the oath which he made him swear unto him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN47_29-31">47:29-31</span>), Joseph, assisted by his brethren, buried Jacob in the cave of Machpelah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_2,13">50:2, 13</span>). At the Exodus, Moses “took the bones of Joseph with him,” and they were buried in the “parcel of ground” which Jacob had bought of the sons of Hamor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_32">Joshua 24:32</span>), which became Joseph’s inheritance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN48_22">Genesis 48:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_1">1 Chronicles 5:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_5">John 4:5</span>).<br>Two burials are mentioned as having taken place in the wilderness. That of Miriam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_1">Numbers 20:1</span>), and that of Moses, “in the land of Moab”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_5,6,8">Deuteronomy 34:5, 6, 8</span>). There is no account of the actual burial of Aaron, which probably, however, took place on the summit of Mount Hor(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_28,29">Numbers 20:28, 29</span>).<br>Joshua was buried “in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_30">Joshua 24: 30</span>).<br>In Job we find a reference to burying-places, which were probably the Pyramids (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS3_14,15">3:14, 15</span>). The Hebrew word for “waste places” here resembles in sound the Egyptian word for “pyramids.” Samuel, like Moses, was honoured with a national burial (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_1">1 Samuel 25:1</span>).<br>Joab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_34">1 Kings 2:34</span>) “was buried in his own house in the wilderness.” In connection with the burial of Saul and his three sons we meet for the first time with the practice of burning the dead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S131_11-13">1 Samuel 31:11-13</span>). The same practice is again referred to by Amos (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_10">6:10</span>).<br>Absalom was buried “in the wood” where he was slain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_17,18">2 Samuel 18:17, 18</span>). The raising of the heap of stones over his grave was intended to mark abhorrence of the person buried (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_26">Joshua 7:26</span> and 8:29). There was no fixed royal burying-place for the Hebrew kings. We find several royal burials taking place, however, “in the city of David” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_10">1 Kings 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_43">11:43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_8">15:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_19,20">2 Kings 14:19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_38">15:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_31">1 Kings 14:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_50">22:50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R221_19,20">2 Chronicles 21:19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R224_25">2 Chronicles 24:25</span>, etc.). Hezekiah was buried in the mount of the sepulchres of the sons of David; “and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_33">2 Chronicles 32:33</span>).<br>Little is said regarding the burial of the kings of Israel. Some of them were buried in Samaria, the capital of their kingdom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_35">2 Kings 10:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_9">13:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_16">14:16</span>).<br>Our Lord was buried in a new tomb, hewn out of the rock, which Joseph of Arimathea had prepared for himself (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_57-60">Matthew 27:57-60</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_46">Mark 15:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_41,42">John 19:41, 42</span>).<br>The grave of Lazarus was “a cave, and a stone lay on it” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_38">John 11:38</span>).<br>Graves were frequently either natural caverns or artificial excavations formed in the sides of rocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_">Genesis 23</span>:9; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_60">Matthew 27:60</span>); and coffins were seldom used, unless when the body was brought from a distance.<br>
