Their ancestor was “Seir,” who probably gave his name to the district where he lived. They were a branch of the Hivites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_6">Genesis 14:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_20-30">36:20-30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_38,39">1 Chronicles 1:38, 39</span>).
