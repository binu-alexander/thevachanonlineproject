It has usually been supposed to have been a city of Gilead, on the east of Jordan.<br>It is probably, however, the modern Tell-el-Kaimun, on the southern slopes of Carmel, the Jokneam of Carmel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_22">Joshua 12:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_12">1 Kings 4:12</span>), since it is not at all unlikely that after he became judge, Jair might find it more convenient to live on the west side of Jordan; and that he was buried where he had lived.<br>
