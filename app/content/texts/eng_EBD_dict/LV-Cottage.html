A booth in a vineyard (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_8">Isaiah 1:8</span></span>); a temporary shed covered with leaves or straw to shelter the watchman that kept the garden.<br>These were slight fabrics, and were removed when no longer needed, or were left to be blown down in winter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB27_18">Job 27:18</span>).<br>(2.) A lodging-place (rendered “lodge” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_8">Isaiah 1:8</span></span>); a slighter structure than the “booth,” as the cucumber patch is more temporary than a vineyard (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_20">Isaiah 24:20</span>). It denotes a frail structure of boughs supported on a few poles, which is still in use in the East, or a hammock suspended between trees, in which the watchman was accustomed to sleep during summer.<br>(3.) In <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_6">Zephaniah 2:6</span> it is the rendering of the Hebrew keroth, which some suppose to denote rather “pits” (R.V. marg., “caves”) or “wells of water,” such as shepherds would sink.<br>
