In early times among the Hebrews cooking was performed by the mistress of the household (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_2-6">Genesis 18:2-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_19">Judges 6:19</span>), and the process was very expeditiously performed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_3,4,9,10">Genesis 27:3, 4, 9, 10</span>). Professional cooks were afterwards employed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S18_13">1 Samuel 8:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_23">9:23</span>). Few animals, as a rule, were slaughtered (other than sacrifices), except for purposes of hospitality(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_7">Genesis 18:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_23">Luke 15:23</span>). The paschal lamb was roasted over a fire(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_8,9">Exodus 12:8, 9</span>; 2Chronicles 35:13). Cooking by boiling was the usual method adopted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV8_31">Leviticus 8:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_23">Exodus 16:23</span>). No cooking took place on the Sabbath day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_3">Exodus 35:3</span>).<br>
