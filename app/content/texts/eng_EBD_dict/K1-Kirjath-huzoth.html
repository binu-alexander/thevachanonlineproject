Balak here received and entertained Balaam, whom he had invited from Pethor, among the “mountains of the east,” beyond the Euphrates, to lay his ban upon the Israelites, whose progress he had no hope otherwise of arresting. It was probably from the summit of Attarus, the high place near the city, that the soothsayer first saw the encampments of Israel.<br>
