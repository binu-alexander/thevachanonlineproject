Its inhabitants were Hivites(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_19">11:19</span>). It lay within the territory of Benjamin, and became a priest-city(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_25">18:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_17">21:17</span>). Here the tabernacle was set up after the destruction of Nob, and here it remained many years till the temple was built by Solomon. It is represented by the modern el-Jib, to the south-west of Ai, and about 5 1/2 miles north-north-west of Jerusalem.<br>A deputation of the Gibeonites, with their allies from three other cities(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_">Joshua 9</span>;17), visited the camp at Gilgal, and by false representations induced Joshua to enter into a league with them, although the Israelites had been specially warned against any league with the inhabitants of Canaan(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_32">Exodus 23:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_12">34:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_55">Numbers 33:55</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_2">Deuteronomy 7:2</span>). The deception practised on Joshua was detected three days later; but the oath rashly sworn “by Jehovah God of Israel” was kept, and the lives of the Gibeonites were spared. They were, however, made “bondmen” to the sanctuary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_">Joshua 9</span>:23).<br>The most remarkable incident connected with this city was the victory Joshua gained over the kings of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_16-27">Joshua 10:16-27</span>). The battle here fought has been regarded as “one of the most important in the history of the world.” The kings of southern Canaan entered into a confederacy against Gibeon (because it had entered into a league with Joshua) under the leadership of Adoni-zedec, king of Jerusalem, and marched upon Gibeon with the view of taking possession of it. The Gibeonites entreated Joshua to come to their aid with the utmost speed. His army came suddenly upon that of the Amorite kings as it lay encamped before the city. It was completely routed, and only broken remnants of their great host found refuge in the fenced cities. The five confederate kings who led the army were taken prisoners, and put to death at Makkedah (q.v.). This eventful battle of Beth-horon sealed the fate of all the cities of Southern Palestine.<br>Among the Amarna tablets is a letter from Adoni-zedec (q.v.) to the king of Egypt, written probably at Makkedah after the defeat, showing that the kings contemplated flight into Egypt.<br>This place is again brought into notice as the scene of a battle between the army of Ish-bosheth under Abner and that of David led by Joab. At the suggestion of Abner, to spare the effusion of blood twelve men on either side were chosen to decide the battle. The issue was unexpected; for each of the men slew his fellow, and thus they all perished. The two armies then engaged in battle, in which Abner and his host were routed and put to flight (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_12-17">2 Samuel 2:12-17</span>). This battle led to a virtual truce between Judah and Israel, Judah, under David, increasing in power; and Israel, under Ish-bosheth, continually losing ground.<br>Soon after the death of Absalom and David’s restoration to his throne his kingdom was visited by a grievous famine, which was found to be a punishment for Saul’s violation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_2,5">2 Samuel 21:2, 5</span>) of the covenant with the Gibeonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_">Joshua 9</span>:3-27). The Gibeonites demanded blood for the wrong that had been done to them, and accordingly David gave up to them the two sons of Rizpah (q.v.) and the five sons of Michal, and these the Gibeonites took and hanged or crucified “in the hill before the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_9">2 Samuel 21:9</span>); and there the bodies hung for six months (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_10">21:10</span>), and all the while Rizpah watched over the blackening corpses and “suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.” David afterwards removed the bones of Saul and Jonathan at Jabeshgilead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_12,13">21:12, 13</span>).<br>Here, “at the great stone,” Amasa was put to death by Joab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_5-10">2 Samuel 20:5-10</span>). To the altar of burnt-offering which was at Gibeon, Joab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_28-34">1 Kings 2:28-34</span>), who had taken the side of Adonijah, fled for sanctuary in the beginning of Solomon’s reign, and was there also slain by the hand of Benaiah.<br>Soon after he came to the throne, Solomon paid a visit of state to Gibeon, there to offer sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K13_4">1 Kings 3:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R21_3">2 Chronicles 1:3</span>). On this occasion the Lord appeared to him in a memorable dream, recorded in 1 Kings 3:5-15; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R21_7-12">2 Chronicles 1:7-12</span>. When the temple was built “all the men of Israel assembled themselves” to king Solomon, and brought up from Gibeon the tabernacle and “all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle” to Jerusalem, where they remained till they were carried away by Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_13">2 Kings 24:13</span>).<br>
