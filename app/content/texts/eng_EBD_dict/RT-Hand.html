</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Hand" ><div class="is"><b>HAND</b></div><br>"HAND" Called by Galen “the instrument of instruments.” It is the symbol of human action (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_16">Psalm 9:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_30">Job 9:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_15">Isaiah 1:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>).<br>Washing the hands was a symbol of innocence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS26_6">Psalm 26:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS73_13">73:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_24">Matthew 27:24</span>), also of sanctification (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_11">1 Corinthians 6:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_16">Isaiah 51:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS24_3,4">Psalm 24:3, 4</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS77_2">Psalm 77:2</span> the correct rendering is, as in the Revised Version, “My hand was stretched out,” etc., instead of, as in the Authorized Version, “My sore ran in the night,” etc.<br>The right hand denoted the south, and the left the north (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB23_9">Job 23:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_19">1 Samuel 23:19</span>). To give the right hand was a pledge of fidelity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_15">2 Kings 10:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER10_19">Ezra 10:19</span>); also of submission to the victors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK17_18">Ezekiel 17:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_15">Jeremiah 50:15</span>). The right hand was lifted up in taking an oath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_22">Genesis 14:22</span>, etc.). The hand is frequently mentioned, particularly the right hand, as a symbol of power and strength (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS60_5">Psalm 60:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_2">Isaiah 28:2</span>). To kiss the hand is an act of homage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_18">1 Kings 19:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB31_27">Job 31:27</span>), and to pour water on one’s hands is to serve him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_11">2 Kings 3:11</span>). The hand of God is the symbol of his power: its being upon one denotes favour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER7_6,28">Ezra 7:6, 28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_25">Isaiah 1:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_66">Luke 1:66</span>, etc.) or punishment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_3">Exodus 9:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_15">Judges 2:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_11">Acts 13:11</span>, etc.).<br>A position at the right hand was regarded as the chief place of honour and power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_9">Psalm 45:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS80_17">80:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS110_1">110:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_64">Matthew 26:64</span>).<br>
