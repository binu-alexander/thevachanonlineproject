It was called citrus, citron wood, by the Romans. It was the Callitris quadrivalvis of botanists, of the cone-bearing order of trees, and of the cypress tribe of this order.<br>The name of this wood is derived from the Greek word thuein, “to sacrifice,” and it was so called because it was burnt in sacrifices, on account of its fragrance. The wood of this tree was reckoned very valuable, and was used for making articles of furniture by the Greeks and Romans.<br>Like the cedars of Lebanon, it is disappearing from the forests of Palestine.<br>
