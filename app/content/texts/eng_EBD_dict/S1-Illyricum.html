It was traversed by Paul in his third missionary journey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM15_19">Romans 15:19</span>). It was the farthest district he had reached in preaching the gospel of Christ.<br>This reference to Illyricum is in harmony with <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_2">Acts 20:2</span>, inasmuch as the apostleâ€™s journey over the parts of Macedonia would bring him to the borders of Illyricum.<br>
