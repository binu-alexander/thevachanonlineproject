The division of animals into clean and unclean was probably founded on the practice of sacrifice. It existed before the Flood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_2">Genesis 7:2</span>). The regulations regarding such animals are recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_">Leviticus 11</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_1-21">Deuteronomy 14:1-21</span>.<br>The Hebrews were prohibited from using as food certain animal substances, such as (1) blood; (2) the fat covering the intestines, termed the caul; (3) the fat on the intestines, called the mesentery; (4) the fat of the kidneys; and (5) the fat tail of certain sheep (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_13,22">Exodus 29:13, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV3_4-9">Leviticus 3:4-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV9_19">9:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV17_10">17:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_26">19:26</span>).<br>The chief design of these regulations seems to have been to establish a system of regimen which would distinguish the Jews from all other nations. Regarding the design and the abolition of these regulations the reader will find all the details in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_24-26">Leviticus 20:24-26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_9-16">Acts 10:9-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_1-10">11:1-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_9-14">Hebrews 9:9-14</span>.<br>
