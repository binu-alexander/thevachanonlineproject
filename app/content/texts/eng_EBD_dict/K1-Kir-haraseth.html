After the death of Ahab, Mesha, king of Moab (see MOABITE STONE), threw off allegiance to the king of Israel, and fought successfully for the independence of his kingdom. After this Jehoram, king of Israel, in seeking to regain his supremacy over Moab, entered into an alliance with Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and with the king of Edom. The three kings led their armies against Mesha, who was driven back to seek refuge in Kir-haraseth. The Moabites were driven to despair. Mesha then took his eldest son, who would have reigned in his stead, and offered him as a burnt-offering on the wall of the fortress in the sight of the allied armies.<br>“There was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.” The invaders evacuated the land of Moab, and Mesha achieved the independence of his country (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_20-27">2 Kings 3:20-27</span>).<br>
