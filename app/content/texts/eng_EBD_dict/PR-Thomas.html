He was also called Didymus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_16">John 11:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_24">20:24</span>), which is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name. All we know regarding him is recorded in the fourth Gospel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_15,16">John 11:15, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_4,5">14:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_24,25,26-29">20:24, 25, 26-29</span>). From the circumstance that in the lists of the apostles he is always mentioned along with Matthew, who was the son of Alphaeus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_18">Mark 3:18</span></span>), and that these two are always followed by James, who was also the son of Alphaeus, it has been supposed that these three, Matthew, Thomas, and James, were brothers.<br>
