This Hebrew word is the first and the most generally used for a prophet. In the time of Samuel another word, ro’eh, “seer”, began to be used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_9">1 Samuel 9:9</span>). It occurs seven times in reference to Samuel. Afterwards another word, hozeh,“seer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_11">2 Samuel 24:11</span>), was employed. In 1 Ch. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S229_29">29:29</span> all these three words are used: “Samuel the seer (ro’eh), Nathan the prophet (nabi’), Gad the seer” (hozeh). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_22">Joshua 13:22</span> Balaam is called (Hebrews ) a kosem“diviner,” a word used only of a false prophet.<br>The “prophet” proclaimed the message given to him, as the “seer” beheld the vision of God. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_6,8">Numbers 12:6, 8</span>.) Thus a prophet was a spokesman for God; he spake in God’s name and by his authority (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX7_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX7_1">Exodus 7:1</span></span>). He is the mouth by which God speaks to men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR1_9">Jeremiah 1:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_16">Isaiah 51:16</span>), and hence what the prophet says is not of man but of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P21_20,21">2 Peter 1:20, 21</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB3_7">Hebrews 3:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_25">Acts 4:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_25">28:25</span>). Prophets were the immediate organs of God for the communication of his mind and will to men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_18,19">Deuteronomy 18:18, 19</span>). The whole Word of God may in this general sense be spoken of as prophetic, inasmuch as it was written by men who received the revelation they communicated from God, no matter what its nature might be. The foretelling of future events was not a necessary but only an incidental part of the prophetic office. The great task assigned to the prophets whom God raised up among the people was“to correct moral and religious abuses, to proclaim the great moral and religious truths which are connected with the character of God, and which lie at the foundation of his government.” Any one being a spokesman for God to man might thus be called a prophet. Thus Enoch, Abraham, and the patriarchs, as bearers of God’s message (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_7">Genesis 20:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX7_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX7_1">Exodus 7:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_15">Psalm 105:15</span>), as also Moses(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_10">34:10</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_13">12:13</span>), are ranked among the prophets.<br>The seventy elders of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_16-29">Numbers 11:16-29</span>), “when the spirit rested upon them, prophesied;” Asaph and Jeduthun “prophesied with a harp”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="R125_3">1 Chronicles 25:3</span>). Miriam and Deborah were prophetesses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20">Exodus 15:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_4">Judges 4:4</span>). The title thus has a general application to all who have messages from God to men.<br>But while the prophetic gift was thus exercised from the beginning, the prophetical order as such began with Samuel. Colleges, “schools of the prophets”, were instituted for the training of prophets, who were constituted, a distinct order (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_18-24">1 Samuel 19:18-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_3,15">2 Kings 2:3, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_38">4:38</span>), which continued to the close of the Old Testament. Such “schools” were established at Ramah, Bethel, Gilgal, Gibeah, and Jericho. The “sons” or“disciples” of the prophets were young men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_22">2 Kings 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_1,4">9:1, 4</span>) who lived together at these different “schools” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_38-41">4:38-41</span>). These young men were taught not only the rudiments of secular knowledge, but they were brought up to exercise the office of prophet, “to preach pure morality and the heart-felt worship of Jehovah, and to act along and co-ordinately with the priesthood and monarchy in guiding the state aright and checking all attempts at illegality and tyranny.” In New Testament times the prophetical office was continued. Our Lord is frequently spoken of as a prophet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_33">Luke 13:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_19">24:19</span>). He was and is the great Prophet of the Church. There was also in the Church a distinct order of prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C112_28">1 Corinthians 12:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_20">Ephesians 2:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_5">3:5</span>), who made new revelations from God. They differed from the “teacher,” whose office it was to impart truths already revealed.<br>Of the Old Testament prophets there are sixteen, whose prophecies form part of the inspired canon. These are divided into four groups:(1.) The prophets of the northern kingdom (Israel), viz., Hosea, Amos, Joel, Jonah.<br>(2.) The prophets of Judah, viz., Isaiah, Jeremiah, Obadiah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah.<br>(3.) The prophets of Captivity, viz., Ezekiel and Daniel.<br>(4.) The prophets of the Restoration, viz., Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.<br>
