This valley afterwards became the common receptacle for all the refuse of the city. Here the dead bodies of animals and of criminals, and all kinds of filth, were cast and consumed by fire kept always burning. It thus in process of time became the image of the place of everlasting destruction. In this sense it is used by our Lord in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_22,29,30">Matthew 5:22, 29, 30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_28">10:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_9">18:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_15,33">23:15, 33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_43,45,47">Mark 9:43, 45, 47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_5">Luke 12:5</span>. In these passages, and also in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM3_6">James 3:6</span>, the word is uniformly rendered “hell,” the Revised Version placing “Gehenna” in the margin. (See HELL; HINNOM.)
