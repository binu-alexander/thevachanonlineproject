It is represented under a variety of aspects in Scripture: (1.) “The dust shall return to the earth as it was” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</span>).<br>(2.) “Thou takest away their breath, they die” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_29">Psalm 104:29</span>).<br>(3.) It is the dissolution of “our earthly house of this tabernacle” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>); the “putting off this tabernacle” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P21_13,14">2 Peter 1:13, 14</span>).<br>(4.) Being “unclothed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_3,4">2 Corinthians 5:3, 4</span>).<br>(5.) “Falling on sleep” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS76_5">Psalm 76:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_39">Jeremiah 51:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_36">Acts 13:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P23_9">2 Peter 3:9</span>.<br>(6.) “I go whence I shall not return” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB10_21">Job 10:21</span>); “Make me to know mine end” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS39_4">Psalm 39:4</span>); “to depart” (Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS1_23">1:23</span>).<br>The grave is represented as “the gates of death” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_17">Job 38:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_13">Psalm 9:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS107_18">107:18</span>). The gloomy silence of the grave is spoken of under the figure of the “shadow of death” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_6">Jeremiah 2:6</span>).<br>Death is the effect of sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_14">Hebrews 2:14</span>), and not a “debt of nature.” It is but once (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_27">9:27</span>), universal (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_19">Genesis 3:19</span>), necessary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_28-30">Luke 2:28-30</span>). Jesus has by his own death taken away its sting for all his followers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_55-57">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</span>).<br>There is a spiritual death in trespasses and sins, i.e., the death of the soul under the power of sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_6">Romans 8:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_1,3">Ephesians 2:1, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_13">Colossians 2:13</span>).<br>The “second death” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_11">Revelation 2:11</span>) is the everlasting perdition of the wicked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV21_8">Revelation 21:8</span>), and “second” in respect to natural or temporal death.<br>THE DEATH OF CHRIST is the procuring cause incidentally of all the blessings men enjoy on earth. But specially it is the procuring cause of the actual salvation of all his people, together with all the means that lead thereto. It does not make their salvation merely possible, but certain(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_11">Matthew 18:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM5_10">Romans 5:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_4">Galatians 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_13">3:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_7">Ephesians 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_16">2:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_32-35">Romans 8:32-35</span>).<br>
