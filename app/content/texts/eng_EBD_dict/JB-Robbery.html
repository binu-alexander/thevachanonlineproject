See also 1 Samuel 27:6-10; 30; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_2">4:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_9">6:9</span>). Robbers infested Judea in our Lord’s time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_30">Luke 10:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_40">John 18:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC5_36,37">Acts 5:36, 37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_38">21:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_26">2 Corinthians 11:26</span>).<br>The words of the Authorized Version, “counted it not robbery to be equal,” etc. (Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C22_6,7">2:6, 7</span>), are better rendered in the Revised Version,“counted it not a prize to be on an equality,” etc., i.e., “did not look upon equality with God as a prize which must not slip from his grasp” = “did not cling with avidity to the prerogatives of his divine majesty; did not ambitiously display his equality with God.”“Robbers of churches” should be rendered, as in the Revised Version, “of temples.” In the temple at Ephesus there was a great treasure-chamber, and as all that was laid up there was under the guardianship of the goddess Diana, to steal from such a place would be sacrilege (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_37">Acts 19:37</span>).<br>
