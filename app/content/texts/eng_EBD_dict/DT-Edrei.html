One of the chief towns of the kingdom of Bashan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_4,5">Joshua 12:4, 5</span>). Here Og was defeated by the Israelites, and the strength of the Amorites broken (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_33-35">Numbers 21:33-35</span>). It subsequently belonged to Manasseh, for a short time apparently, and afterwards became the abode of banditti and outlaws (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_31">Joshua 13:31</span>). It has been identified with the modern Edr’a, which stands on a rocky promontory on the south-west edge of the Lejah (the Argob of the Hebrews, and Trachonitis of the Greeks). The ruins of Edr’a are the most extensive in the Hauran.<br>They are 3 miles in circumference. A number of the ancient houses still remain; the walls, roofs, and doors being all of stone. The wild region of which Edrei was the capital is thus described in its modern aspect:“Elevated about 20 feet above the plain, it is a labyrinth of clefts and crevasses in the rock, formed by volcanic action; and owing to its impenetrable condition, it has become a refuge for outlaws and turbulent characters, who make it a sort of Cave of Adullam...It is, in fact, an impregnable natural fortress, about 20 miles in length and 15 in breadth”(Porter’s Syria, etc.). Beneath this wonderful city there is also a subterranean city, hollowed out probably as a refuge for the population of the upper city in times of danger. (See BASHAN.)(2.) A town of Naphtali (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_37">Joshua 19:37</span>).<br>
