A mountain peak (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_28">Numbers 23:28</span>) to which Balak led Balaam as a last effort to induce him to pronounce a curse upon Israel.<br>When he looked on the tribes encamped in the acacia groves below him, he could not refrain from giving utterance to a remarkable benediction(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_1-9">24:1-9</span>). Balak was more than ever enraged at Balaam, and bade him flee for his life. But before he went he gave expression to that wonderful prediction regarding the future of this mysterious people, whose “goodly tents” were spread out before him, and the coming of a “Star” out of Jacob and a “Sceptre” out of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_14-17">24:14-17</span>).<br>(2.) A Moabite divinity, called also “Baal-peor” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_3,5,18">Numbers 25:3, 5, 18</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_29">Deuteronomy 3:29</span>).<br>
