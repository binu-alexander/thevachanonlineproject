He had three sons, Haran, Nahor, and Abraham, and one daughter, Sarah. He settled in “Ur of the Chaldees,” where his son Haran died, leaving behind him his son Lot. Nahor settled at Haran, a place on the way to Ur. Terah afterwards migrated with Abraham (probably his youngest son) and Lot (his grandson), together with their families, from Ur, intending to go with them to Canaan; but he tarried at Haran, where he spent the remainder of his days, and died at the age of two hundred and five years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_24-32">Genesis 11:24-32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_2">Joshua 24:2</span>). What a wonderful part the descendants of this Chaldean shepherd have played in the history of the world!
