Here the Israelites made their third encampment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_20">Exodus 13:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_6">Numbers 33:6</span>). The camp was probably a little to the west of the modern town of Ismailia. Here the Israelites were commanded to change their route(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_2">Exodus 14:2</span>), and “turn” towards the south, and encamp before Pi-hahiroth.
