A man of Mount Ephraim, whose history so far is introduced in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG17_">Judges 17</span>, apparently for the purpose of leading to an account of the settlement of the tribe of Dan in Northern Palestine, and for the purpose also of illustrating the lawlessness of the times in which he lived (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_">Judges 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG19_1-29">19:1-29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_25">21:25</span>).<br>(2.) The son of Merib-baal (Mephibosheth), <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_34,35">1 Chronicles 8:34, 35</span>.<br>(3.) The first in rank of the priests of the family of Kohathites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_20">1 Chronicles 23:20</span>).<br>(4.) A descendant of Joel the Reubenite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_5">1 Chronicles 5:5</span>).<br>(5.) “The Morasthite,” so called to distinguish him from Micaiah, the son of Imlah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_8">1 Kings 22:8</span>). He was a prophet of Judah, a contemporary of Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC1_1">Micah 1:1</span>), a native of Moresheth of Gath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC1_14,15">1:14, 15</span>). Very little is known of the circumstances of his life (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR26_18,19">Jeremiah 26:18, 19</span>).<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>MICAH</b></div><br>"MICAH", BOOK OF the sixth in order of the so-called minor prophets.<br>The superscription to this book states that the prophet exercised his office in the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham’s reign to the end of Hezekiah’s (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, “Micaiah the son of Imlah” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_28">1 Kings 22:28</span>): “Hearken, O people, every one of you.” The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke,“Hear ye,” etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of Zacharias (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_72,73">Luke 1:72, 73</span>). The prediction regarding the place “where Christ should be born,” one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC5_2">Micah <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_2">5:2</span></span>), is quoted in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6">Matthew 2:6</span></span>.<br>There are the following references to this book in the New Testament: 5:2, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6">Matthew 2:6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_42">John 7:42</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_6">7:6</span>, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_21,35,36">Matthew 10:21,35,36</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_20">7:20</span>, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_72,73">Luke 1:72,73</span>.<br>
