Mention is made of the pool of Gibeon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_13">2 Samuel 2:13</span>); the pool of Hebron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S24_12">4:12</span>); the upper pool at Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_17">2 Kings 18:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K220_20">20:20</span>); the pool of Samaria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_38">1 Kings 22:38</span>); the king’s pool (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_14">Nehemiah 2:14</span>); the pool of Siloah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_15">Nehemiah 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_6">Ecclesiastes 2:6</span>); the fishpools of Heshbon (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC7_4">7:4</span>); the “lower pool,” and the “old pool” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_9,11">Isaiah 22:9,11</span>).<br>The “pool of Bethesda” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN5_2,4,7">John 5:2,4, 7</span>) and the “pool of Siloam” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN9_7,11">John 9:7, 11</span>) are also mentioned. Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN35_7">35:7</span>) says, “The parched ground shall become a pool.” This is rendered in the Revised Version “glowing sand,” etc. (marg., “the mirage,” etc.). The Arabs call the mirage “serab,” plainly the same as the Hebrew word sarab, here rendered “parched ground.”“The mirage shall become a pool”, i.e., the mock-lake of the burning desert shall become a real lake, “the pledge of refreshment and joy.” The “pools” spoken of in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS14_23">Isaiah 14:23</span> are the marshes caused by the ruin of the canals of the Euphrates in the neighbourhood of Babylon.<br>The cisterns or pools of the Holy City are for the most part excavations beneath the surface. Such are the vast cisterns in the temple hill that have recently been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund. These underground caverns are about thirty-five in number, and are capable of storing about ten million gallons of water. They are connected with one another by passages and tunnels.<br>
