Kings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_10">1 Kings 2:10</span>) and prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_1">1 Samuel 25:1</span>) were generally buried within cities. Graves were generally grottoes or caves, natural or hewn out in rocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_16">Isaiah 22:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_60">Matthew 27:60</span>). There were family cemeteries (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN47_29">Genesis 47:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_5">50:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_37">2 Samuel 19:37</span>). Public burial-places were assigned to the poor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR26_23">Jeremiah 26:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_6">2 Kings 23:6</span>). Graves were usually closed with stones, which were whitewashed, to warn strangers against contact with them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_27">Matthew 23:27</span>), which caused ceremonial pollution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU19_16">Numbers 19:16</span>).<br>There were no graves in Jerusalem except those of the kings, and according to tradition that of the prophetess Huldah.<br>
