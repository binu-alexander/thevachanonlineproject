They are distinguished as Beth-horon “the upper” and Beth-horon “the nether.” They are about 2 miles apart, the former being about 10 miles north-west of Jerusalem.<br>Between the two places was the ascent and descent of Beth-horon, leading from Gibeon down to the western plain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_10,11">Joshua 10:10, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_13,14">18:13, 14</span>), down which the five kings of the Amorites were driven by Joshua in that great battle, the most important in which the Hebrews had been as yet engaged, being their first conflict with their enemies in the open field.<br>Jehovah interposed in behalf of Israel by a terrific hailstorm, which caused more deaths among the Canaanites than did the swords of the Israelites.<br>Beth-horon is mentioned as having been taken by Shishak, B.C. 945, in the list of his conquests, and the pass was the scene of a victory of Judas Maccabeus. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_19,25">Exodus 9:19, 25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_22,23">Job 38:22, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_12-14">Psalm 18:12-14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_30">Isaiah 30:30</span>.) The modern name of these places is Beit-ur, distinguished by el-Foka, “the upper,” and el-Tahta, “the nether.” The lower was at the foot of the pass, and the upper, 500 feet higher, at the top, west of Gibeon. (See GIBEON.)
