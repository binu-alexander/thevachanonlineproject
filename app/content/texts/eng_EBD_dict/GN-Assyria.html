It was a mountainous region lying to the north of Babylonia, extending along the Tigris as far as to the high mountain range of Armenia, the Gordiaean or Carduchian mountains.<br>It was founded in B.C. 1700 under Bel-kap-kapu, and became an independent and a conquering power, and shook off the yoke of its Babylonian masters. It subdued the whole of Northern Asia. The Assyrians were Semites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_22">Genesis 10:22</span>), but in process of time non-Semite tribes mingled with the inhabitants. They were a military people, the “Romans of the East.” Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria little is positively known.<br>In B.C. 1120 Tiglath-pileser I., the greatest of the Assyrian kings, “crossed the Euphrates, defeated the kings of the Hittites, captured the city of Carchemish, and advanced as far as the shores of the Mediterranean.” He may be regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. After this the Assyrians gradually extended their power, subjugating the states of Northern Syria. In the reign of Ahab, king of Israel, Shalmaneser II.<br>marched an army against the Syrian states, whose allied army he encountered and vanquished at Karkar. This led to Ahab’s casting off the yoke of Damascus and allying himself with Judah. Some years after this the Assyrian king marched an army against Hazael, king of Damascus. He besieged and took that city. He also brought under tribute Jehu, and the cities of Tyre and Sidon.<br>About a hundred years after this (B.C. 745) the crown was seized by a military adventurer called Pul, who assumed the name of Tiglath-pileser III. He directed his armies into Syria, which had by this time regained its independence, and took (B.C. 740) Arpad, near Aleppo, after a siege of three years, and reduced Hamath. Azariah (Uzziah) was an ally of the king of Hamath, and thus was compelled by Tiglath-pileser to do him homage and pay a yearly tribute.<br>In B.C. 738, in the reign of Menahem, king of Israel, Pul invaded Israel, and imposed on it a heavy tribute (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_19">2 Kings 15:19</span>). Ahaz, the king of Judah, when engaged in a war against Israel and Syria, appealed for help to this Assyrian king by means of a present of gold and silver (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_8">2 Kings 16:8</span>); who accordingly “marched against Damascus, defeated and put Rezin to death, and besieged the city itself.” Leaving a portion of his army to continue the siege, “he advanced through the province east of Jordan, spreading fire and sword,” and became master of Philistia, and took Samaria and Damascus. He died B.C. 727, and was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV., who ruled till B.C. 722. He also invaded Syria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_5">2 Kings 17:5</span>), but was deposed in favour of Sargon (q.v.) the Tartan, or commander-in-chief of the army, who took Samaria (q.v.) after a siege of three years, and so put an end to the kingdom of Israel, carrying the people away into captivity, B.C. 722 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_1-6,24">2 Kings 17:1-6, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_7,9">18:7, 9</span>). He also overran the land of Judah, and took the city of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_6,12,22,24,34">Isaiah 10:6, 12, 22, 24, 34</span>). Mention is next made of Sennacherib (B.C. 705), the son and successor of Sargon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_13">2 Kings 18:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_37">19:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_17,18">Isaiah 7:17, 18</span>); and then of Esar-haddon, his son and successor, who took Manasseh, king of Judah, captive, and kept him for some time a prisoner at Babylon, which he alone of all the Assyrian kings made the seat of his government (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_37">2 Kings 19:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_38">Isaiah 37:38</span>).<br>Assur-bani-pal, the son of Esarhaddon, became king, and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER4_10">Ezra 4:10</span> is referred to as Asnapper. From an early period Assyria had entered on a conquering career, and having absorbed Babylon, the kingdoms of Hamath, Damascus, and Samaria, it conquered Phoenicia, and made Judea feudatory, and subjected Philistia and Idumea. At length, however, its power declined.<br>In B.C. 727 the Babylonians threw off the rule of the Assyrians, under the leadership of the powerful Chaldean prince Merodach-baladan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K220_12">2 Kings 20:12</span>), who, after twelve years, was subdued by Sargon, who now reunited the kingdom, and ruled over a vast empire. But on his death the smouldering flames of rebellion again burst forth, and the Babylonians and Medes successfully asserted their independence (B.C. 625), and Assyria fell according to the prophecies of Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_5-19">10:5-19</span>), Nahum (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_19">3:19</span>), and Zephaniah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_13">3:13</span>), and the many separate kingdoms of which it was composed ceased to recognize the “great king” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_19">2 Kings 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS36_4">Isaiah 36:4</span>). Ezekiel (31) attests (about B.C. 586) how completely Assyria was overthrown. It ceases to be a nation. (See NINEVEH; BABYLON.)
