The material so referred to was manufactured from the papyrus, and hence its name. The papyrus (Hebrews gome) was a kind of bulrush (q.v.). It is mentioned by Job (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_11">8:11</span>) and Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN35_7">35:7</span>). It was used for many purposes. This plant(Papyrus Nilotica) is now unknown in Egypt; no trace of it can be found.<br>The unaccountable disappearance of this plant from Egypt was foretold by Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_6,7">19:6, 7</span>) as a part of the divine judgment on that land. The most extensive papyrus growths now known are in the marshes at the northern end of the lake of Merom.<br>
