Cisterns are frequently mentioned in Scripture. The scarcity of springs in Palestine made it necessary to collect rain-water in reservoirs and cisterns (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_22">Numbers 21:22</span>). (See WELL.) Empty cisterns were sometimes used as prisons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR38_6">Jeremiah 38:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM3_53">Lamentations 3:53</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS40_2">Psalm 40:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS69_15">69:15</span>). The “pit” into which Joseph was cast (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_24">Genesis 37:24</span>) was a beer or dry well. There are numerous remains of ancient cisterns in all parts of Palestine.<br>
