He repelled the invasion, slaying 600 men with an “ox goad” (q.v.). The goad was a formidable sharpointed instrument, sometimes ten feet long. He was probably contemporary for a time with Deborah and Barak (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_31">Judges 3:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_6">5:6</span>).<br>
