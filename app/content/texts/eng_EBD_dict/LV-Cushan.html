Some have, however, supposed this to be the same as Chushan-rishathaim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_8,10">Judges 3:8, 10</span>), i.e., taking the latter part of the name as a title or local appellation, Chushan “of the two iniquities”(= oppressing Israel, and provoking them to idolatry), a Mesopotamian king, identified by Rawlinson with Asshur-ris-ilim (the father of Tiglathpileser I.); but incorrectly, for the empire of Assyria was not yet founded. He held Israel in bondage for eight years.<br>
