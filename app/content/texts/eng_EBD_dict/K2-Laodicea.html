It was originally called Diospolis and then Rhoas, but afterwards Laodicea, from Laodice, the wife of Antiochus II., king of Syria, who rebuilt it. It was one of the most important and flourishing cities of Asia Minor. At a very early period it became one of the chief seats of Christianity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_1">Colossians 2:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_15">4:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_11">Revelation 1:11</span>, etc.).<br>It is now a deserted place, called by the Turks Eski-hissar or “old castle.”
