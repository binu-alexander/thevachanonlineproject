We have only two specimens from the book, (1) the words of Joshua which he spake to the Lord at the crisis of the battle of Beth-horon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_12,13">Joshua 10:12, 13</span>); and (2) “the Song of the Bow,” that beautiful and touching mournful elegy which David composed on the occasion of the death of Saul and Jonathan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_18-27">2 Samuel 1:18-27</span>).<br>
