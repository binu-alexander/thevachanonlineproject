The resurrection of the dead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_51">1 Corinthians 15:51</span>), and other doctrines which need to be explained but which cannot be fully understood by finite intelligence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_11">Matthew 13:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_25">Romans 11:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C113_2">1 Corinthians 13:2</span>); the union between Christ and his people symbolized by the marriage union(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_31,32">Ephesians 5:31, 32</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_19">6:19</span>); the seven stars and the seven candlesticks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_20">Revelation 1:20</span>); and the woman clothed in scarlet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_7">17:7</span>), are also in this sense mysteries. The anti-Christian power working in his day is called by the apostle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_7">2 Thessalonians 2:7</span>) the “mystery of iniquity.”
