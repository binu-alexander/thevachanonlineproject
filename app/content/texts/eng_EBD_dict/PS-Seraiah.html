The father of Joab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_13,14">1 Chronicles 4:13, 14</span>).<br>(2.) The grandfather of Jehu (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_35">1 Chronicles 4:35</span>).<br>(3.) One of David’s scribes or secretaries (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>).<br>(4.) A Netophathite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_8">Jeremiah 40:8</span>), a chief priest of the time of Zedekiah.<br>He was carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, and there put to death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_18,23">2 Kings 25:18, 23</span>).<br>(5.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_2">Ezra 2:2</span>.<br>(6.) Father of Ezra the scribe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER7_1">7:1</span>).<br>(7.) A ruler of the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_11">Nehemiah 11:11</span>).<br>(8.) A priest of the days of Jehoiakim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_1,12">Nehemiah 12:1, 12</span>).<br>(9.) The son of Neriah. When Zedekiah made a journey to Babylon to do homage to Nebuchadnezzar, Seraiah had charge of the royal gifts to be presented on that occasion. Jeremiah took advantage of the occasion, and sent with Seraiah a word of cheer to the exiles in Babylon, and an announcement of the doom in store for that guilty city. The roll containing this message (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_1-8">Jeremiah 50:1-8</span>) Seraiah was to read to the exiles, and then, after fixing a stone to it, was to throw it into the Euphrates, uttering, as it sank, the prayer recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_59-64"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_59">Jeremiah 51:59</span>-64</span>. Babylon was at this time in the height of its glory, the greatest and most powerful monarchy in the world. Scarcely seventy years elapsed when the words of the prophet were all fulfilled. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_59">Jeremiah 51:59</span> is rendered in the Revised Version, “Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain,” instead of “was a quiet prince,” as in the Authorized Version.<br>
