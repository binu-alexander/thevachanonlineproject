The septenary festivals were,(a) The weekly Sabbath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_">Leviticus 23</span>:1-3; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_3-30">Exodus 19:3-30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_8-11">20:8-11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX31_12">31:12</span>, etc.).<br>(b) The seventh new moon, or the feast of Trumpets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_11-15">Numbers 28:11-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU29_1-6">29:1-6</span>).<br>(c) The Sabbatical year (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_10,11">Exodus 23:10, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_2-7">Leviticus 25:2-7</span>).<br>(d) The year of jubilee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_">Leviticus 23</span>-35; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_8-16">25: 8-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_16-25">27:16-25</span>).<br>(2.) The great feasts were,(a) The Passover. (b) The feast of Pentecost, or of weeks. (c) The feast of Tabernacles, or of ingathering.<br>On each of these occasions every male Israelite was commanded “to appear before the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT27_7">Deuteronomy 27:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_9-12">Nehemiah 8:9-12</span>). The attendance of women was voluntary. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_41">Luke 2:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_7">1 Samuel 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_19">2:19</span>.) The promise that God would protect their homes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_23,24">Exodus 34:23, 24</span>) while all the males were absent in Jerusalem at these feasts was always fulfilled. “During the whole period between Moses and Christ we never read of an enemy invading the land at the time of the three festivals. The first instance on record is thirty-three years after they had withdrawn from themselves the divine protection by imbruing their hands in the Saviour’s blood, when Cestius, the Roman general, slew fifty of the people of Lydda while all the rest had gone up to the feast of Tabernacles, A.D. 66.” These festivals, besides their religious purpose, had an important bearing on the maintenance among the people of the feeling of a national unity.<br>The times fixed for their observance were arranged so as to interfere as little as possible with the industry of the people. The Passover was kept just before the harvest commenced, Pentecost at the conclusion of the corn harvest and before the vintage, the feast of Tabernacles after all the fruits of the ground had been gathered in.<br>(3.) The Day of Atonement, the tenth day of the seventh month (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_1,34">Leviticus 16:1, 34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_26-32">23:26-32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU29_7-11">Numbers 29:7-11</span>). (See ATONEMENT, DAY OF.) Of the post-Exilian festivals reference is made to the feast of Dedication(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_22">John 10:22</span>). This feast was appointed by Judas Maccabaeus in commemoration of the purification of the temple after it had been polluted by Antiochus Epiphanes. The “feast of Purim” (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET9_24-32">Esther 9:24-32</span>, was also instituted after the Exile. (Cf. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN5_1">John 5:1</span>.)
