The one I saw was of the ‘oak of Bashan,’ and measured upwards of ten feet in length. At one end was an iron spear, and at the other a piece of the same metal flattened. One can well understand how a warrior might use such a weapon with effect in the battle-field”(Porter’s Syria, etc.). (See GOAD.)
