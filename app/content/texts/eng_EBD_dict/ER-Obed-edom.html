(1.) “The Gittite” (probably so called because he was a native of Gath-rimmon), a Levite of the family of the Korhites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R126_1,4-8">1 Chronicles 26:1, 4-8</span>), to whom was specially intrusted the custody of the ark (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_18">1 Chronicles 15:18</span>). When David was bringing up the ark “from the house of Abinadab, that was in Gibeah” (probably some hill or eminence near Kirjath-jearim), and had reached Nachon’s threshing-floor, he became afraid because of the “breach upon Uzzah,” and carried it aside into the house of Obededom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_1-12">2 Samuel 6:1-12</span>). There it remained for six months, and was to him and his house the occasion of great blessing. David then removed it with great rejoicing to Jerusalem, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle he had pitched for it.<br>(2.) A Merarite Levite, a temple porter, who with his eight sons guarded the southern gate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_18">1 Chronicles 15:18</span>, 21; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R126_4,8,15">26:4, 8, 15</span>).<br>(3.) One who had charge of the temple treasures (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_24">2 Chronicles 25:24</span>).<br>
