Daemoniacs are frequently distinguished from those who are afflicted with ordinary bodily maladies(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_32">Mark 1:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_17,18">16:17, 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_17,18">Luke 6:17, 18</span>). The daemons speak in their own persons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_29">Matthew 8:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_23,24">Mark 1:23, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_7">5:7</span>). This influence is clearly distinguished from the ordinary power of corruption and of temptation over men. In the daemoniac his personality seems to be destroyed, and his actions, words, and even thoughts to be overborne by the evil spirit(Mark, l.c.; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_15">Acts 19:15</span>).<br>
