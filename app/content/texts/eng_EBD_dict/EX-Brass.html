What is designated by this word in Scripture is properly copper (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_9">Deuteronomy 8:9</span>). It was used for fetters (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21">Judges 16:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_7">2 Kings 25:7</span>), for pieces of armour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_5,6">1 Samuel 17:5, 6</span>), for musical instruments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_19">1 Chronicles 15:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C113_1">1 Corinthians 13:1</span>), and for money(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_9">Matthew 10:9</span>).<br>It is a symbol of insensibility and obstinacy in sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS48_4">Isaiah 48:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR6_28">Jeremiah 6:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK22_18">Ezekiel 22:18</span>), and of strength (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS107_16">Psalm 107:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC4_13">Micah 4:13</span>).<br>The Macedonian empire is described as a kingdom of brass (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_39">Daniel 2:39</span>).<br>The “mountains of brass” Zechariah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN6_1">6:1</span>) speaks of have been supposed to represent the immutable decrees of God.<br>The serpent of brass was made by Moses at the command of God(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_4-9">Numbers 21:4-9</span>), and elevated on a pole, so that it might be seen by all the people when wounded by the bite of the serpents that were sent to them as a punishment for their murmurings against God and against Moses. It was afterwards carried by the Jews into Canaan, and preserved by them till the time of Hezekiah, who caused it to be at length destroyed because it began to be viewed by the people with superstitious reverence(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_4">2 Kings 18:4</span>). (See NEHUSHTAN.) The brazen serpent is alluded to by our Lord in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN3_14,15">John 3:14, 15</span>. (See SERPENT.)
