At first the word goyim denoted generally all the nations of the world (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_18">Genesis 18:18</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_8">Galatians 3:8</span>).<br>The Jews afterwards became a people distinguished in a marked manner from the other goyim. They were a separate people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_23">Leviticus 20:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_14-45">26:14-45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_">Deuteronomy 28</span>), and the other nations, the Amorites, Hittites, etc., were the goyim, the heathen, with whom the Jews were forbidden to be associated in any way (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS23_7">Joshua 23:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_2">1 Kings 11:2</span>). The practice of idolatry was the characteristic of these nations, and hence the word came to designate idolaters (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS106_47">Psalm 106:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR46_28">Jeremiah 46:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_3">Lamentations 1:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS36_18">Isaiah 36:18</span>), the wicked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_5,15,17">Psalm 9:5, 15, 17</span>).<br>The corresponding Greek word in the New Testament, ethne, has similar shades of meaning. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_21">Acts 22:21</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_14">Galatians 3:14</span>, it denotes the people of the earth generally; and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_7">Matthew 6:7</span>, an idolater. In modern usage the word denotes all nations that are strangers to revealed religion.<br>
