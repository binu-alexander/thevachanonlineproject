Another is mentioned as having occurred in the days of Isaac, causing him to go to Gerar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_1">Genesis 26:1</span>, 17). But the most remarkable of all was that which arose in Egypt in the days of Joseph, which lasted for seven years(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_-45">Genesis 41-45</span>).<br>Famines were sent as an effect of Godâ€™s anger against a guilty people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_1,2">2 Kings 8:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM8_11">Amos 8:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_22-42">Deuteronomy 28:22-42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_1">2 Samuel 21:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_25-28">2 Kings 6:25-28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_3">25:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_15">Jeremiah 14:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR19_9">19:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR42_17">42:17</span>, etc.). A famine was predicted by Agabus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_28">Acts 11:28</span>). Josephus makes mention of the famine which occurred A.D. 45. Helena, queen of Adiabene, being at Jerusalem at that time, procured corn from Alexandria and figs from Cyprus for its poor inhabitants.<br>
