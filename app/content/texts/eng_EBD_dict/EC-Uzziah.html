(1.) One of Amaziah’s sons, whom the people made king of Judah in his father’s stead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_21">2 Kings 14:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_1">2 Chronicles 26:1</span>). His long reign of about fifty-two years was “the most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon.” He was a vigorous and able ruler, and “his name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_8,14">2 Chronicles 26:8, 14</span>). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_3">2 Kings 15:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_4,5">2 Chronicles 26:4, 5</span>); but toward the close of his long life “his heart was lifted up to his destruction,” and he wantonly invaded the priest’s office (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_1">2 Chronicles 26:1</span>6), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_1">2 Chronicles 26:1</span>7), saying, “It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense.” Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_19-21">26:19-21</span>), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in “a several house” to the day of his death(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_5,27">2 Kings 15:5, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_3">2 Chronicles 26:3</span>). He was buried in a separate grave“in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_7">2 Kings 15:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_23">2 Chronicles 26:23</span>). “That lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore” (Dr. Green’s Kingdom of Israel, etc.).<br>(2.) The father of Jehonathan, one of David’s overseers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_25">1 Chronicles 27:25</span>).<br>
