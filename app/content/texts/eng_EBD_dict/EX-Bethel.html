A place in Central Palestine, about 10 miles north of Jerusalem, at the head of the pass of Michmash and Ai. It was originally the royal Canaanite city of Luz (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_19">Genesis 28:19</span>). The name Bethel was at first apparently given to the sanctuary in the neighbourhood of Luz, and was not given to the city itself till after its conquest by the tribe of Ephraim. When Abram entered Canaan he formed his second encampment between Bethel and Hai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_8">Genesis 12:8</span>); and on his return from Egypt he came back to it, and again “called upon the name of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_4">13:4</span>). Here Jacob, on his way from Beersheba to Haran, had a vision of the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached unto heaven (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_10,19">28:10, 19</span>); and on his return he again visited this place, “where God talked with him” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_1-15">35:1-15</span>), and there he “built an altar, and called the place El-beth-el” (q.v.). To this second occasion of God’s speaking with Jacob at Bethel, Hosea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_4,5">12:4,5</span>) makes reference.<br>In troublous times the people went to Bethel to ask counsel of God(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_18,31">Judges 20:18, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_2">21:2</span>). Here the ark of the covenant was kept for a long time under the care of Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_26-28">20:26-28</span>). Here also Samuel held in rotation his court of justice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_16">1 Samuel 7:16</span>). It was included in Israel after the kingdom was divided, and it became one of the seats of the worship of the golden calf (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_28-33">1 Kings 12:28-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K113_1">13:1</span>). Hence the prophet Hosea (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_15">4:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_8">5:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_5,8">10:5, 8</span>) calls it in contempt Beth-aven, i.e.,“house of idols.” Bethel remained an abode of priests even after the kingdom of Israel was desolated by the king of Assyria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_28,29">2 Kings 17:28, 29</span>). At length all traces of the idolatries were extirpated by Josiah, king of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_15-18">2 Kings 23:15-18</span>); and the place was still in existence after the Captivity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_28">Ezra 2:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_32">Nehemiah 7:32</span>). It has been identified with the ruins of Beitin, a small village amid extensive ruins some 9 miles south of Shiloh.<br>(2.) Mount Bethel was a hilly district near Bethel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS16_1">Joshua 16:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_2">1 Samuel 13:2</span>).<br>(3.) A town in the south of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS8_17">Joshua 8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_16">12:16</span>).<br>
