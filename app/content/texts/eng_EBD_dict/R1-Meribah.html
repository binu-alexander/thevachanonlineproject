One of the names given by Moses to the fountain in the desert of Sin, near Rephidim, which issued from the rock in Horeb, which he smote by the divine command, “because of the chiding of the children of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_1-7">Exodus 17:1-7</span>). It was also called Massah (q.v.). It was probably in Wady Feiran, near Mount Serbal.<br>(2.) Another fountain having a similar origin in the desert of Zin, near to Kadesh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU27_14">Numbers 27:14</span>). The two places are mentioned together in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_8">Deuteronomy 33:8</span>. Some think the one place is called by the two names(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS81_7">Psalm 81:7</span>). In smiting the rock at this place Moses showed the same impatience as the people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_10-12">Numbers 20:10-12</span>). This took place near the close of the wanderings in the desert (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_1-24">Numbers 20:1-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_51">Deuteronomy 32:51</span>).<br>
