Hebrews ‘ez, the she-goat (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_9">Genesis 15:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_35">30:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_38">31:38</span>). This Hebrew word is also used for the he-goat (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_5">Exodus 12:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_23">Leviticus 4:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_15">Numbers 28:15</span>), and to denote a kid (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_17,20">Genesis 38:17, 20</span>). Hence it may be regarded as the generic name of the animal as domesticated. It literally means “strength,” and points to the superior strength of the goat as compared with the sheep.<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘attud, only in plural; rendered “rams” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_10,12">Genesis 31:10,12</span>); he-goats (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU7_17-88">Numbers 7:17-88</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_11">Isaiah 1:11</span>); goats (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14">Deuteronomy <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_14">32:14</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS50_13">Psalm 50:13</span>). They were used in sacrifice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS66_15">Psalm 66:15</span>). This word is used metaphorically for princes or chiefs in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS14_9">Isaiah 14:9</span>, and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC10_3">Zechariah 10:3</span> as leaders. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_8">Jeremiah 50:8</span>.)(3.) Hebrews gedi, properly a kid. Its flesh was a delicacy among the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_9,14,17">Genesis 27:9, 14, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_19">Judges 6:19</span>).<br>(4.) Hebrews sa’ir, meaning the “shaggy,” a hairy goat, a he-goat (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_23">2 Chronicles 29:23</span>); “a goat” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_24">Leviticus 4:24</span>); “satyr” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_21">Isaiah 13:21</span>);“devils” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV17_7">Leviticus 17:7</span>). It is the goat of the sin-offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV9_3,15">Leviticus 9:3, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_16">10:16</span>).<br>(5.) Hebrews tsaphir, a he-goat of the goats (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_21">2 Chronicles 29:21</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_5,8">Daniel 8:5, 8</span> it is used as a symbol of the Macedonian empire.<br>(6.) Hebrews tayish, a “striker” or “butter,” rendered “he-goat” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_35">Genesis 30:35</span>; 32:14).<br>(7.) Hebrews ‘azazel (q.v.), the “scapegoat” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_8,10,26">Leviticus 16:8, 10,26</span>).<br>(8.) There are two Hebrew words used to denote the undomesticated goat:, Yael, only in plural mountain goats (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_2">1 Samuel 24:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB39_1">Job 39:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_18">Psalm 104:18</span>). It is derived from a word meaning “to climb.” It is the ibex, which abounded in the mountainous parts of Moab. And ’akko, only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_5">Deuteronomy 14:5</span>, the wild goat.<br>Goats are mentioned in the New Testament in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_32,33">Matthew 25:32,33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_12,13,19">Hebrews 9:12,13, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_4">10:4</span>. They represent oppressors and wicked men(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK34_17">Ezekiel 34:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK39_18">39:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_33">Matthew 25:33</span>).<br>Several varieties of the goat were familiar to the Hebrews. They had an important place in their rural economy on account of the milk they afforded and the excellency of the flesh of the kid. They formed an important part of pastoral wealth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_10,12">Genesis 31:10, 12</span>;32:14; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_2">1 Samuel 25:2</span>).<br>
