The circumstances under which Abraham’s“steward” found her at the “city of Nahor,” in Padan-aram, are narrated in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_-27">Genesis 24-27</span>. “She can hardly be regarded as an amiable woman. When we first see her she is ready to leave her father’s house for ever at an hour’s notice; and her future life showed not only a full share of her brother Laban’s duplicity, but the grave fault of partiality in her relations to her children, and a strong will, which soon controlled the gentler nature of her husband.” The time and circumstances of her death are not recorded, but it is said that she was buried in the cave of Machpelah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_31">Genesis 49:31</span>).<br>
