A king of Hazor, at the time of the entrance of Israel into Canaan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_1-14">Joshua 11:1-14</span>), whose overthrow and that of the northern chief with whom he had entered into a confederacy against Joshua was the crowning act in the conquest of the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_21-23">11:21-23</span>; comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS14_6-15">14:6-15</span>). This great battle, fought at Lake Merom, was the last of Joshua’s battles of which we have any record. Here for the first time the Israelites encountered the iron chariots and horses of the Canaanites.<br>(2.) Another king of Hazor, called “the king of Canaan,” who overpowered the Israelites of the north one hundred and sixty years after Joshua’s death, and for twenty years held them in painful subjection. The whole population were paralyzed with fear, and gave way to hopeless despondency (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_6-11">Judges 5:6-11</span>), till Deborah and Barak aroused the national spirit, and gathering together ten thousand men, gained a great and decisive victory over Jabin in the plain of Esdraelon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_10-16">Judges 4:10-16</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS83_9">Psalm 83:9</span>). This was the first great victory Israel had gained since the days of Joshua. They never needed to fight another battle with the Canaanites(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_31">Judges 5:31</span>).<br>
