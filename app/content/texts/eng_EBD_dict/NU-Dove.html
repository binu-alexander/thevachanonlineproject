The dove was placed on the standards of the Assyrians and Babylonians in honour, it is supposed, of Semiramis(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_38">Jeremiah 25:38</span>; Vulg., “fierceness of the dove;” comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR46_16">Jeremiah 46:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_16">50:16</span>). Doves and turtle-doves were the only birds that could be offered in sacrifice, as they were clean according to the Mosaic law (Ge. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR15_9">15:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_7">Leviticus 5:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV12_6">12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_24">Luke 2:24</span>). The dove was the harbinger of peace to Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_8,10">Genesis 8:8, 10</span>). It is often mentioned as the emblem of purity(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_13">Psalm <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_13">68:13</span></span>). It is a symbol of the Holy Spirit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_2">Genesis 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_16">Matthew 3:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_10">Mark 1:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_22">Luke 3:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_32">John 1:32</span>); also of tender and devoted affection (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_15">1:15</span>; 2:14). David in his distress wished that he had the wings of a dove, that he might fly away and be at rest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS55_6-8">Psalm 55:6-8</span>).<br>There is a species of dove found at Damascus “whose feathers, all except the wings, are literally as yellow as gold” (68:13).<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>DOVE</b></div><br>"DOVE"’S DUNG (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_25">2 Kings 6:25</span>) has been generally understood literally.<br>There are instances in history of the dung of pigeons being actually used as food during a famine. Compare also the language of Rabshakeh to the Jews(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_27">2 Kings 18:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS36_12">Isaiah 36:12</span>). This name, however, is applied by the Arabs to different vegetable substances, and there is room for the opinion of those who think that some such substance is here referred to, as, e.g., the seeds of a kind of millet, or a very inferior kind of pulse, or the root of the ornithogalum, i.e., bird-milk, the star-of-Bethlehem.<br>
