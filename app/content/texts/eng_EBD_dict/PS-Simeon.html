The second son of Jacob by Leah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_33">Genesis 29:33</span>).<br>He was associated with Levi in the terrible act of vengeance against Hamor and the Shechemites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_25,26">34:25, 26</span>). He was detained by Joseph in Egypt as a hostage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN42_24">42:24</span>). His father, when dying, pronounced a malediction against him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_5-7">49:5-7</span>). The words in the Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_6">49:6</span>), “they digged down a wall,” ought to be, as correctly rendered in the Revised Version,“they houghed an ox.”(2.) An aged saint who visited the temple when Jesus was being presented before the Lord, and uttered lofty words of thankgiving and of prophecy(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_29-35">Luke 2:29-35</span>).<br>(3.) One of the ancestors of Joseph (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_30">Luke 3:30</span>).<br>(4.) Surnamed Niger, i.e., “black,” perhaps from his dark complexion, a teacher of some distinction in the church of Antioch (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_1-3">Acts 13:1-3</span>). It has been supposed that this was the Simon of Cyrene who bore Christ’s cross.<br>Note the number of nationalities represented in the church at Antioch.<br>(5.) James (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_14">Acts 15:14</span>) thus designates the apostle Peter (q.v.).<br>

They gradually dwindled in number, and sank into a position of insignificance among the other tribes. They decreased in the wilderness by about two-thirds (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_23">Numbers 1:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_14">26:14</span>). Moses pronounces no blessing on this tribe. It is passed by in silence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_">Deuteronomy 33</span>).<br>This tribe received as their portion a part of the territory already allotted to Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_1-9">Joshua 19:1-9</span>). It lay in the south-west of the land, with Judah on the east and Dan on the north; but whether it was a compact territory or not cannot be determined. The subsequent notices of this tribe are but few (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_24-43">1 Chronicles 4:24-43</span>). Like Reuben on the east of Jordan, this tribe had little influence on the history of Israel.<br>
