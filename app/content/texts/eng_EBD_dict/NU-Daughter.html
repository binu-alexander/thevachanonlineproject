A niece or any female descendant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_12">Genesis 20:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_48">24:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_6">28:6</span>). (2.) Women as natives of a place, or as professing the religion of a place; as, “the daughters of Zion” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_16">Isaiah 3:16</span>), “daughters of the Philistines” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_20">2 Samuel 1:20</span>). (3.) Small towns and villages lying around a city are its “daughters,” as related to the metropolis or mother city. Tyre is in this sense called the daughter of Sidon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS23_12">Isaiah 23:12</span>). (4.) The people of Jerusalem are spoken of as “the daughters of Zion” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_22">Isaiah 37:22</span>). (5.) The daughters of a tree are its boughs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_22">Genesis 49:22</span>). (6.) The “daughters of music” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_4">Ecclesiastes 12:4</span>) are singing women.<br>
