It corresponds generally with what is now known as the Soudan (i.e., the land of the blacks). This country was known to the Hebrews, and is described in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_1">Isaiah 18:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP3_10">Zephaniah 3:10</span>. They carried on some commercial intercourse with it(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_14">Isaiah 45:14</span></span>).<br>Its inhabitants were descendants of Ham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_6">Genesis 10:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR13_23">Jeremiah 13:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_2">Isaiah 18:2</span>, “scattered and peeled,” A.V.; but in R.V., “tall and smooth”).<br>Herodotus, the Greek historian, describes them as “the tallest and handsomest of men.” They are frequently represented on Egyptian monuments, and they are all of the type of the true negro. As might be expected, the history of this country is interwoven with that of Egypt.<br>Ethiopia is spoken of in prophecy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_31"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_31">Psalm 68:31</span></span>; 87:4; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_14">Isaiah 45:14</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK30_4-9">Ezekiel 30:4-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN11_43">Daniel 11:43</span>; Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_8-10">3:8-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HK3_7">Habakkuk 3:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_12">Zephaniah 2:12</span>).<br>
