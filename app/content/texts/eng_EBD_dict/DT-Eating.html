In the time of our Lord they would not eat with Samaritans (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_9">John 4:9</span>), and were astonished that he ate with publicans and sinners (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_11">Matthew 9:11</span>). The Hebrews originally sat at table, but afterwards adopted the Persian and Chaldean practice of reclining (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_36-50">Luke 7:36-50</span>). Their principal meal was at noon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_16">Genesis 43:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K120_16">1 Kings 20:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_14">Ruth 2:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_12">Luke 14:12</span>). The word “eat” is used metaphorically in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR15_16">Jeremiah 15:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_1">Ezekiel 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV10_9">Revelation 10:9</span>. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN6_53-58">John 6:53-58</span>, “eating and drinking” means believing in Christ. Women were never present as guests at meals (q.v.).<br>
