The Revised Version in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_28">John 1:28</span> has this word instead of Bethabara, on the authority of the oldest manuscripts. It appears to have been the name of a place on the east of Jordan.<br>(2.) A village on the south-eastern slope of the Mount of Olives (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK11_1">Mark 11:1</span>), about 2 miles east of Jerusalem, on the road to Jericho. It derived its name from the number of palm-trees which grew there. It was the residence of Lazarus and his sisters. It is frequently mentioned in connection with memorable incidents in the life of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_17">Matthew 21:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_6">26:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK11_1">Mark 11:1</span>1, 12; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_3">14:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_50">Luke 24:50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_1">John 11:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_1">12:1</span>). It is now known by the name of el-Azariyeh, i.e., “place of Lazarus,” or simply Lazariyeh. Seen from a distance, the village has been described as“remarkably beautiful, the perfection of retirement and repose, of seclusion and lovely peace.” Now a mean village, containing about twenty families.<br>
