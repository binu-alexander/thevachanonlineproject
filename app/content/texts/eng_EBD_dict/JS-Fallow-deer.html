This animal, called in Hebrew yahmur, from a word meaning “to be red,” is regarded by some as the common fallow-deer, the Cervus dama, which is said to be found very generally over Western and Southern Asia. It is called “fallow” from its pale-red or yellow colour.<br>Some interpreters, however, regard the name as designating the bubale, Antelope bubale, the “wild cow” of North Africa, which is about the size of a stag, like the hartebeest of South Africa. A species of deer has been found at Mount Carmel which is called yahmur by the Arabs. It is said to be similar to the European roebuck.<br>
