When offered in sacrifice, they were not divided as other victims were (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_10">Genesis 15:10</span>). They are mentioned also as an article of food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_11">Deuteronomy 14:11</span>). The art of snaring wild birds is referred to (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS124_7">Psalm 124:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR1_17">Proverbs 1:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_23">7:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR5_27">Jeremiah 5:27</span>). Singing birds are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_12">Psalm 104:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_4">Ecclesiastes 12:4</span>. Their timidity is alluded to (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC11_11">11:11</span>). The reference in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS84_3">Psalm 84:3</span> to the swallow and the sparrow may be only a comparison equivalent to, “What her house is to the sparrow, and her nest to the swallow, that thine altars are to my soul.”
