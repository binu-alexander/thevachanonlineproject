The Jews from Jerusalem fled to this place after the death of Gedaliah (q.v.), and settled there for a time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_16">Jeremiah 2:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR43_7">43:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR44_1">44:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR46_14">46:14</span>). A platform of brick-work, which there is every reason to believe was the pavement at the entry of Pharaoh’s palace, has been discovered at this place. “Here,” says the discoverer, Mr. Petrie, “the ceremony described by Jeremiah [<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR43_8-10">43:8-10</span>;“brick-kiln”, i.e., pavement of brick] took place before the chiefs of the fugitives assembled on the platform, and here Nebuchadnezzar spread his royal pavilion” (R.V., “brickwork”).<br>
