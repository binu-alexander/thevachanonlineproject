When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house.<br>This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK19_12-27">Luke 19:12-27</span>). At Er-riha (Jericho) there is a large, venerable looking square tower, which goes by the traditional name of the House of Zacchaeus.<br>
