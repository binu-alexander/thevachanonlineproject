It is nearly impossible to teach an Arab servant to knock at your door. They give warning at the outer gate either by calling or knocking. To stand and call is a very common and respectful mode. Thus Moses commanded the holder of a pledge to stand without and call to the owner to come forth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_10">Deuteronomy 24:10</span>). This was to avoid the violent intrusion of cruel creditors. Peter stood knocking at the outer door (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_13,16">Acts 12:13, 16</span>), and the three men sent to Joppa by Cornelius made inquiry and‘stood before the gate’ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_17,18">10:17, 18</span>). The idea is that the guard over your privacy is to be placed at the entrance.” Knocking is used as a sign of importunity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_7,8">Matthew 7:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_25">Luke 13:25</span>), and of the coming of Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_36">Luke 12:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_20">Revelation 3:20</span>).<br>
