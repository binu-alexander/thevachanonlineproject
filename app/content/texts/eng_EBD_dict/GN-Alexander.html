A relative of Annas the high priest, present when Peter and John were examined before the Sanhedrim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_6">Acts 4:6</span>).<br>(2.) A man whose father, Simon the Cyrenian, bore the cross of Christ(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_21">Mark 15:21</span>).<br>(3.) A Jew of Ephesus who took a prominent part in the uproar raised there by the preaching of Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_33">Acts 19:33</span>). The Jews put him forward to plead their cause before the mob. It was probably intended that he should show that he and the other Jews had no sympathy with Paul any more than the Ephesians had. It is possible that this man was the same as the following.<br>(4.) A coppersmith who, with Hymenaeus and others, promulgated certain heresies regarding the resurrection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_19">1 Timothy 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_14">2 Timothy 4:14</span>), and made shipwreck of faith and of a good conscience. Paul excommunicated him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_20">1 Timothy 1:20</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C15_5">1 Corinthians 5:5</span>).<br>
