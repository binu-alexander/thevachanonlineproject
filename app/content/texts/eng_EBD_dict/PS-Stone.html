This word is also used figuratively of believers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P12_4,5">1 Peter 2:4, 5</span>), and of the Messiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS118_22">Psalm 118:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_16">Isaiah 28:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_42">Matthew 21:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_11">Acts 4:11</span>, etc.). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_45">Daniel 2:45</span> it refers also to the Messiah. He is there described as“cut out of the mountain.” (See ROCK.) A “heart of stone” denotes great insensibility (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_37">1 Samuel 25:37</span>).<br>Stones were set up to commemorate remarkable events, as by Jacob at Bethel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_18">Genesis 28:18</span></span>), at Padan-aram (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_4">35:4</span>), and on the occasion of parting with Laban (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_45-47">31:45-47</span>); by Joshua at the place on the banks of the Jordan where the people first “lodged” after crossing the river (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_8">Joshua 6:8</span>), and also in “the midst of Jordan,” where he erected another set of twelve stones (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS4_1-9">4:1-9</span>); and by Samuel at “Ebenezer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_12">1 Samuel 7:12</span></span>).<br>
