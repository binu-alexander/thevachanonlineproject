Hebrews hoah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_9">2 Kings 14:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB31_40">Job 31:40</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB41_2">Job 41:2</span> the Hebrew word is rendered “thorn,” but in the Revised Version “hook.” It is also rendered “thorn” in 2 Chronicles 33:11; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR26_9">Proverbs 26:9</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR2_2">2:2</span>;“brambles” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_13">Isaiah 34:13</span>. It is supposed to be a variety of the wild plum-tree, but by some it is regarded as the common thistle, of which there are many varieties in Palestine.<br>(2.) Hebrews dardar, meaning “a plant growing luxuriantly” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_18">Genesis 3:18</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_8">10:8</span>); Gr. tribolos, “a triple point” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB6_8">Hebrews 6:8</span>,“brier,” R.V. “thistle”). This was probably the star-thistle, called by botanists Centaurea calcitropa, or “caltrops,” a weed common in corn-fields. (See THORNS.)
