The Jews, after the Captivity, were reguired to dismiss the foreign women they had married contrary to the law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER10_11-19">Ezra 10:11-19</span>). Christ limited the permission of divorce to the single case of adultery. It seems that it was not uncommon for the Jews at that time to dissolve the union on very slight pretences (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_31,32">Matthew 5:31, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_1-9">19:1-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_2-12">Mark 10:2-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_18">Luke 16:18</span>). These precepts given by Christ regulate the law of divorce in the Christian Church.<br>
