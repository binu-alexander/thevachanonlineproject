Joseph and Mary were providentially led to go up to Bethlehem at this period, and there Christ was born (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_1,6">Matthew 2:1, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_1,7">Luke 2:1, 7</span>). The exact year or month or day of his birth cannot, however, now be exactly ascertained. We know, however, that it took place in the “fulness of the time” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_4">Galatians 4:4</span>), i.e., at the fittest time in the world’s history. Chronologists are now generally agreed that the year 4 before the Christian era was the year of Christ’s nativity, and consequently that he was about four years old in the year 1 A.D.<br>
