Hebrews seor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_15,19">Exodus 12:15, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_7">13:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_11">Leviticus 2:11</span></span>), the remnant of dough from the preceding baking which had fermented and become acid.<br>(2.) Hebrews hamets, properly “ferment.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_3">Numbers 6:3</span>, “vinegar of wine” is more correctly “fermented wine.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_7">Exodus 13:7</span>, the proper rendering would be, “Unfermented things [Hebrews matstsoth] shall be consumed during the seven days; and there shall not be seen with thee fermented things [hamets], and there shall not be seen with thee leavened mass [seor] in all thy borders.” The chemical definition of ferment or yeast is “a substance in a state of putrefaction, the atoms of which are in a continual motion.” The use of leaven was strictly forbidden in all offerings made to the Lord by fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_11">Leviticus 2:11</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_12">7:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV8_2">8:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_15">Numbers 6:15</span>). Its secretly penetrating and diffusive power is referred to in 1 Corinthians 5:6. In this respect it is used to illustrate the growth of the kingdom of heaven both in the individual heart and in the world (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_33">Matthew 13:33</span>). It is a figure also of corruptness and of perverseness of heart and life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_6,11">Matthew 16:6, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK8_15">Mark 8:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C15_7,8">1 Corinthians 5:7, 8</span>).<br>
