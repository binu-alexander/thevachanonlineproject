In 2 Kings 6:5 it is the translation of a word used with reference to its being made of iron. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_12">Isaiah 44:12</span> the Revised Version renders by “axe” the Hebrew maatsad, which means a “hewing” instrument. In the Authorized Version it is rendered “tongs.” It is also used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR10_3">Jeremiah 10:3</span>, and rendered “axe.” The“battle-axe” (army of Medes and Persians) mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_20">Jeremiah 51:20</span> was probably, as noted in the margin of the Revised Version, a “maul” or heavy mace. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS74_6">Psalm 74:6</span> the word so rendered means “feller.” (See the figurative expression in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_10">Matthew 3:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_9">Luke 3:9</span>.)
