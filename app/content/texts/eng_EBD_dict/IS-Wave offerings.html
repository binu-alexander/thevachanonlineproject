They then became the property of the priests. The first-fruits, a sheaf of barley, offered at the feast of Pentecost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_17-20">Leviticus 23:17-20</span>), and wheat-bread, the first-fruits of the second harvest, offered at the Passover(10-14), were wave-offerings.<br>
