It occurs only once (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_11">Mark 7:11</span>). It means a gift or offering consecrated to God. Anything over which this word was once pronounced was irrevocably dedicated to the temple. Land, however, so dedicated might be redeemed before the year of jubilee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_16-24">Leviticus 27:16-24</span>). Our Lord condemns the Pharisees for their false doctrine, inasmuch as by their traditions they had destroyed the commandment which requires children to honour their father and mother, teaching them to find excuse from helping their parents by the device of pronouncing“Corban” over their goods, thus reserving them to their own selfish use.<br>
