This name is, however, generally used as the title of that portion of the tribe which was set apart for the subordinate offices of the sanctuary service (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_4">1 Kings 8:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_70">Ezra 2:70</span>), as assistants to the priests.<br>When the Israelites left Egypt, the ancient manner of worship was still observed by them, the eldest son of each house inheriting the priest’s office. At Sinai the first change in this ancient practice was made. A hereditary priesthood in the family of Aaron was then instituted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_1">Exodus 28:1</span>). But it was not till that terrible scene in connection with the sin of the golden calf that the tribe of Levi stood apart and began to occupy a distinct position (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_">Exodus 32</span>). The religious primogeniture was then conferred on this tribe, which henceforth was devoted to the service of the sanctuary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_11-13">Numbers 3:11-13</span>). They were selected for this purpose because of their zeal for the glory of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_">Exodus 32</span>:26), and because, as the tribe to which Moses and Aaron belonged, they would naturally stand by the lawgiver in his work.<br>The Levitical order consisted of all the descendants of Levi’s three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; whilst Aaron, Amram’s son (Amram, son of Kohat), and his issue constituted the priestly order.<br>The age and qualification for Levitical service are specified in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU4_3,23,30,39,43,47">Numbers 4:3, 23, 30, 39, 43, 47</span>.<br>They were not included among the armies of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_47">Numbers 1:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_33">2:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_62"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_62">26:62</span></span>), but were reckoned by themselves. They were the special guardians of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_51">Numbers 1:51</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_22-24">18:22-24</span>). The Gershonites pitched their tents on the west of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_23">3:23</span>), the Kohathites on the south(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_29">3:29</span>), the Merarites on the north (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_35">3:35</span>), and the priests on the east(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_38">3:38</span>). It was their duty to move the tent and carry the parts of the sacred structure from place to place. They were given to Aaron and his sons the priests to wait upon them and do work for them at the sanctuary services(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU8_19">Numbers 8:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_2-6">18:2-6</span>).<br>As being wholly consecrated to the service of the Lord, they had no territorial possessions. Jehovah was their inheritance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_20">Numbers 18:20</span>; 26:62; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT10_9">Deuteronomy 10:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_1,2">18:1, 2</span>), and for their support it was ordained that they should receive from the other tribes the tithes of the produce of the land. Forty-eight cities also were assigned to them, thirteen of which were for the priests “to dwell in”, i.e., along with their other inhabitants.<br>Along with their dwellings they had “suburbs”, i.e., “commons”, for their herds and flocks, and also fields and vineyards (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_2">Numbers 35:2</span>-5). Nine of these cities were in Judah, three in Naphtali, and four in each of the other tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_">Joshua 21</span>). Six of the Levitical cities were set apart as “cities of refuge” (q.v.). Thus the Levites were scattered among the tribes to keep alive among them the knowledge and service of God. (See PRIEST.)
