The “coats of skins” prepared by God for Adam and Eve were probably nothing more than aprons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_21">Genesis 3:21</span>). This tunic was sometimes woven entire without a seam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_23">John 19:23</span>); it was also sometimes of “many colours” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_3">Genesis 37:3</span>; R.V.<br>marg., “a long garment with sleeves”). The “fisher’s coat” of <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7">John 21:7</span> was obviously an outer garment or cloak, as was also the “coat” made by Hannah for Samuel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_19">1 Samuel 2:19</span>).
