All the land traffic between the east and the west passed through it. Menahem undertook an expedition against this city, and “smote Tiphsah and all that were therein” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_16">2 Kings 15:16</span>). This expedition implied a march of some 300 miles from Tirzah if by way of Tadmor, and about 400 if by way of Aleppo; and its success showed the strength of the Israelite kingdom, for it was practically a defiance to Assyria. Conder, however, identifies this place with Khurbet Tafsah, some 6 miles west of Shechem.<br>
