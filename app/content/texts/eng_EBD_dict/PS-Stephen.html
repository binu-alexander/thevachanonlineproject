He was the first Christian martyr. His personal character and history are recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_">Acts 6</span>. “He fell asleep” with a prayer for his persecutors on his lips (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_60">7:60</span>). Devout men carried him to his grave (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_2">8:2</span>).<br>It was at the feet of the young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, that those who stoned him laid their clothes (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT17_5-7">Deuteronomy 17:5-7</span>) before they began their cruel work. The scene which Saul then witnessed and the words he heard appear to have made a deep and lasting impression on his mind (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_19,20">Acts 22:19, 20</span>).<br>The speech of Stephen before the Jewish ruler is the first apology for the universalism of the gospel as a message to the Gentiles as well as the Jews.<br>It is the longest speech contained in the Acts, a place of prominence being given to it as a defence.<br>
