The expression “valley of Achor” probably became proverbial for that which caused trouble, and when Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS65_10">Isaiah 65:10</span>) refers to it he uses it in this sense: “The valley of Achor, a place for herds to lie down in;” i.e., that which had been a source of calamity would become a source of blessing.<br>Hosea also (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_15">2:15</span>) uses the expression in the same sense: “The valley of Achor for a door of hope;” i.e., trouble would be turned into joy, despair into hope. This valley has been identified with the Wady Kelt.<br>
