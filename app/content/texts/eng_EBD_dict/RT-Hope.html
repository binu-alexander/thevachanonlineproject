It is joined to faith and love, and is opposed to seeing or possessing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_24">Romans 8:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J13_2">1 John 3:2</span>). “Hope is an essential and fundamental element of Christian life, so essential indeed, that, like faith and love, it can itself designate the essence of Christianity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P13_15">1 Peter 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_23">Hebrews 10:23</span>). In it the whole glory of the Christian vocation is centred(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_18">Ephesians 1:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_4">4:4</span>).” Unbelievers are without this hope (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_12">Ephesians 2:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H14_13">1 Thessalonians 4:13</span>). Christ is the actual object of the believer’s hope, because it is in his second coming that the hope of glory will be fulfilled (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_1">1 Timothy 1:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_27">Colossians 1:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT2_13">Titus 2:13</span>). It is spoken of as “lively”, i.e., a living, hope, a hope not frail and perishable, but having a perennial life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_3">1 Peter 1:3</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM5_2">Romans 5:2</span> the “hope” spoken of is probably objective, i.e.,“the hope set before us,” namely, eternal life (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM12_12">12:12</span>). In 1 <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN3_3">John 3:3</span> the expression “hope in him” ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version,“hope on him,” i.e., a hope based on God.<br>
