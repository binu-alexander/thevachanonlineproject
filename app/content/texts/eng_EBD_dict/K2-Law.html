The Law of Nature is the will of God as to human conduct, founded on the moral difference of things, and discoverable by natural light (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM1_20">Romans 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM2_14,15">2:14, 15</span>). This law binds all men at all times. It is generally designated by the term conscience, or the capacity of being influenced by the moral relations of things.<br>(2.) The Ceremonial Law prescribes under the Old Testament the rites and ceremonies of worship. This law was obligatory only till Christ, of whom these rites were typical, had finished his work (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB7_9,11">Hebrews 7:9, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_1">10:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_16">Ephesians 2:16</span>). It was fulfilled rather than abrogated by the gospel.<br>(3.) The Judicial Law, the law which directed the civil policy of the Hebrew nation.<br>(4.) The Moral Law is the revealed will of God as to human conduct, binding on all men to the end of time. It was promulgated at Sinai. It is perfect (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_7">Psalm 19:7</span>), perpetual (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_17,18">Matthew 5:17, 18</span>), holy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM7_12">Romans 7:12</span>), good, spiritual (14), and exceeding broad (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_96">Psalm 119:96</span>). Although binding on all, we are not under it as a covenant of works (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_17">Galatians 3:17</span>). (See COMMANDMENTS.)(5.) Positive Laws are precepts founded only on the will of God. They are right because God commands them.<br>(6.) Moral positive laws are commanded by God because they are right.<br>
