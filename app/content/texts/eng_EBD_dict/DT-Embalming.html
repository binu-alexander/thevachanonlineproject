This art was practised by the Egyptians from the earliest times, and there brought to great perfection. This custom probably originated in the belief in the future reunion of the soul with the body. The process became more and more complicated, and to such perfection was it carried that bodies embalmed thousands of years ago are preserved to the present day in the numberless mummies that have been discovered in Egypt.<br>The embalming of Jacob and Joseph was according to the Egyptian custom, which was partially followed by the Jews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R216_14">2 Chronicles 16:14</span>), as in the case of king Asa, and of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_39,40">John 19:39, 40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_56">Luke 23:56</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_1">24:1</span>).
