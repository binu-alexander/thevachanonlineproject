First mentioned as a principal ingredient in the holy anointing oil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_23">Exodus 30:23</span>). It formed part of the gifts brought by the wise men from the east, who came to worship the infant Jesus(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_11">Matthew 2:11</span>). It was used in embalming (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_39">John 19:39</span>), also as a perfume(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ET2_12">Esther 2:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_8">Psalm 45:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_17">Proverbs 7:17</span>). It was a custom of the Jews to give those who were condemned to death by crucifixion “wine mingled with myrrh” to produce insensibility. This drugged wine was probably partaken of by the two malefactors, but when the Roman soldiers pressed it upon Jesus “he received it not” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_23">Mark 15:23</span>). (See GALL.) This was the gum or viscid white liquid which flows from a tree resembling the acacia, found in Africa and Arabia, the Balsamodendron myrrha of botanists. The “bundle of myrrh” in Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_13">1:13</span> is rather a “bag” of myrrh or a scent-bag.<br>(2.) Another word lot is also translated “myrrh” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_25">Genesis 37:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_11">43:11</span>; R.V., marg., “or ladanum”). What was meant by this word is uncertain. It has been thought to be the chestnut, mastich, stacte, balsam, turpentine, pistachio nut, or the lotus. It is probably correctly rendered by the Latin word ladanum, the Arabic ladan, an aromatic juice of a shrub called the Cistus or rock rose, which has the same qualities, though in a slight degree, of opium, whence a decoction of opium is called laudanum. This plant was indigenous to Syria and Arabia.<br>
