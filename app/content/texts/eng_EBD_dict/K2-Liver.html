In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK21_21">Ezekiel 21:21</span> there is allusion, in the statement that the king of Babylon “looked upon the liver,” to one of the most ancient of all modes of divination. The first recorded instance of divination (q.v.) is that of the teraphim of Laban. By the teraphim the LXX. and Josephus understood “the liver of goats.” By the “caul above the liver,” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_9">Leviticus 4:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_4">7:4</span>, etc., some understand the great lobe of the liver itself.<br>
