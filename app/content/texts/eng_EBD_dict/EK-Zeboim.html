One of the “five cities of the plain” of Sodom, generally coupled with Admah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_19">Genesis 10:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_2">14:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_23">Deuteronomy 29:23</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT11_8">11:8</span>). It had a king of its own (Shemeber), and was therefore a place of some importance. It was destroyed along with the other cities of the plain.<br>(2.) A valley or rugged glen somewhere near Gibeah in Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_18">1 Samuel 13:18</span>). It was probably the ravine now bearing the name Wady Shakh-ed-Dub’a, or “ravine of the hyena,” north of Jericho.<br>(3.) A place mentioned only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_34">Nehemiah 11:34</span>, inhabited by the Benjamites after the Captivity.<br>
