At the time of Absalomâ€™s revolt he deserted David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_9">Psalm 41:9</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS55_12-14">55:12-14</span>) and espoused the cause of Absalom(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_12">2 Samuel 15:12</span>). David sent his old friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of Ahithophel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_31-37">2 Samuel 15:31-37</span>). This end was so far gained that Ahithophel saw he had no longer any influence, and accordingly he at once left the camp of Absalom and returned to Giloh, his native place, where, after arranging his wordly affairs, he hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_1-23">2 Samuel 17:1-23</span>). He was the type of Judas (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_9">Psalm 41:9</span></span>).<br>
