(1.) The son of Cushi, and great-grandson of Hezekiah, and the ninth in the order of the minor prophets. He prophesied in the days of Josiah, king of Judah(B.C. 641-610), and was contemporary with Jeremiah, with whom he had much in common. The book of his prophecies consists of:(a) An introduction (1:1-6), announcing the judgment of the world, and the judgment upon Israel, because of their transgressions.<br>(b) The description of the judgment (1:7-18).<br>(c) An exhortation to seek God while there is still time (2:1-3).<br>(d) The announcement of judgment on the heathen (2:4-15).<br>(e) The hopeless misery of Jerusalem (3:1-7).<br>(f) The promise of salvation (3:8-20).<br>(2.) The son of Maaseiah, the “second priest” in the reign of Zedekiah, often mentioned in Jeremiah as having been sent from the king to inquire(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR21_1">Jeremiah 21:1</span>) regarding the coming woes which he had denounced, and to entreat the prophet’s intercession that the judgment threatened might be averted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR29_25,26,29">Jeremiah 29:25, 26, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR37_3">37:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_24">52:24</span>). He, along with some other captive Jews, was put to death by the king of Babylon “at Riblah in the land of Hamath” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_21">2 Kings 25:21</span>).<br>(3.) A Kohathite ancestor of the prophet Samuel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_36">1 Chronicles 6:36</span>).<br>(4.) The father of Josiah, the priest who dwelt in Jerusalem when Darius issued the decree that the temple should be rebuilt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_10">Zechariah 6:10</span>).<br>
