Probably it is the same person who is again mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM16_13">Romans 16:13</span> as a disciple at Rome, whose mother also was a Christian held in esteem by the apostle. Mark mentions him along with his brother Alexander as persons well known to his readers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_21">Mark 15:21</span></span>).<br>
