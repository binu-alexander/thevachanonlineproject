All Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_21">1 Kings 10: 21</span>). The cups mentioned in the New Testament were made after Roman and Greek models, and were sometimes of gold(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4">Revelation 17:4</span></span>).<br>The art of divining by means of a cup was practiced in Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN44_2-17">Genesis 44:2-17</span>), and in the East generally.<br>The “cup of salvation” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS116_13">Psalm 116:13</span>) is the cup of thanksgiving for the great salvation. The “cup of consolation” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR16_7">Jeremiah 16:7</span>) refers to the custom of friends sending viands and wine to console relatives in mourning(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_6">Proverbs 31:6</span>). In 1 Corinthians 10:16, the “cup of blessing” is contrasted with the “cup of devils” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_21">1 Corinthians 10:21</span>). The sacramental cup is the“cup of blessing,” because of blessing pronounced over it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_27">Matthew 26:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_17">Luke 22:17</span>). The “portion of the cup” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS11_6">Psalm 11:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS16_5">16:5</span>) denotes one’s condition of life, prosperous or adverse. A “cup” is also a type of sensual allurement (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_7">Jeremiah 51:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_31">Proverbs 23:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4">Revelation 17:4</span></span>). We read also of the “cup of astonishment,” the “cup of trembling,” and the “cup of God’s wrath” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8">Psalm 75:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_17">Isaiah 51:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_15">Jeremiah 25:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM4_21">Lamentations 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_32">Ezekiel 23:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV16_19">Revelation 16:19</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_39,42">Matthew 26:39, 42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_11">John 18:11</span>). The cup is also the symbol of death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_28">Matthew 16:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_1">Mark 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_9">Hebrews 2:9</span>).<br>
