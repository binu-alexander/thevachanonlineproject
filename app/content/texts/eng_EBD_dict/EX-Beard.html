Hence the import of Ezekiel’s (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_1-4">5:1-4</span>) description of the “razor” i.e., the agents of an angry providence being used against the guilty nation of the Jews. It was a part of a Jew’s daily toilet to anoint his beard with oil and perfume (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS133_2">Psalm 133:2</span>). Beards were trimmed with the most fastidious care (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_24">2 Samuel 19:24</span>), and their neglet was an indication of deep sorrow (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS15_2">Isaiah 15:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_5">Jeremiah 41:5</span>). The custom was to shave or pluck off the hair as a sign of mourning (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS50_6">Isaiah 50:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_37">Jeremiah 48:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER9_3">Ezra 9:3</span>). The beards of David’s ambassadors were cut off by hanun (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_4">2 Samuel 10:4</span>) as a mark of indignity.<br>On the other hand, the Egyptians carefully shaved the hair off their faces, and they compelled their slaves to do so also (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_14">Genesis 41:14</span>).<br>
