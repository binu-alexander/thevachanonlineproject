Three kinds of divination are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK21_21">Ezekiel 21:21</span>, by arrows, consulting with images (the teraphim), and by examining the entrails of animals sacrificed. The practice of this art seems to have been encouraged in ancient Egypt. Diviners also abounded among the aborigines of Canaan and the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_6">Isaiah 2:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_">1 Samuel 28</span>). At a later period multitudes of magicians poured from Chaldea and Arabia into the land of Israel, and pursued their occupations (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS8_19">Isaiah 8:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_6">2 Kings 21:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R233_6">2 Chronicles 33:6</span>). This superstition widely spread, and in the time of the apostles there were “vagabond Jews, exorcists”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_13">Acts 19:13</span>), and men like Simon Magus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_9">Acts 8:9</span>), Bar-Jesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_6,8">13:6, 8</span>), and other jugglers and impostors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_19">19:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T23_13">2 Timothy 3:13</span>). Every species and degree of this superstition was strictly forbidden by the law of Moses(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_18">Exodus 22:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_26,31">Leviticus 19:26, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_27">20:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_10,11">Deuteronomy 18:10, 11</span>).<br>But beyond these various forms of superstition, there are instances of divination on record in the Scriptures by which God was pleased to make known his will.<br>(1.) There was divination by lot, by which, when resorted to in matters of moment, and with solemnity, God intimated his will (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_13">Joshua 7:13</span>). The land of Canaan was divided by lot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_55,56">Numbers 26:55, 56</span>); Achan’s guilt was detected (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_16-19">Joshua 7:16-19</span>), Saul was elected king (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_20,21">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</span>), and Matthias chosen to the apostleship, by the solem lot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_26">Acts 1:26</span>). It was thus also that the scape-goat was determined (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_8-10">Leviticus 16:8-10</span>).<br>(2.) There was divination by dreams (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_6">Genesis 20:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT13_1,3">Deuteronomy 13:1, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_13,15">Judges 7:13, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT1_20">Matthew 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_12,13,19,22">2:12, 13, 19, 22</span>). This is illustrated in the history of Joseph (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_25-32">Genesis 41:25-32</span>) and of Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_27">2:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_19-28">4:19-28</span>).<br>(3.) By divine appointment there was also divination by the Urim and Thummim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU27_21">Numbers 27:21</span>), and by the ephod.<br>(4.) God was pleased sometimes to vouch-safe direct vocal communications to men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_10">Deuteronomy 34:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_4">Exodus 3:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_3">4:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_14,15">Deuteronomy 4:14, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_12">1 Kings 19:12</span>). He also communed with men from above the mercy-seat (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_22">Exodus 25:22</span>), and at the door of the tabernacle(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_42,43">Exodus 29:42, 43</span>).<br>(5.) Through his prophets God revealed himself, and gave intimations of his will (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_17">2 Kings 13:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_63,64">Jeremiah 51:63, 64</span>).<br>
