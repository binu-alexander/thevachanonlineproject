Here we have its original charter, which was confirmed by our Lord, as the basis on which all regulations are to be framed(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_4,5">Matthew 19:4, 5</span>). It is evident that monogamy was the original law of marriage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_5">Matthew 19:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_16">1 Corinthians 6:16</span>). This law was violated in after times, when corrupt usages began to be introduced (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_19">Genesis 4:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN6_2">6:2</span>). We meet with the prevalence of polygamy and concubinage in the patriarchal age (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN16_1-4">Genesis 16:1-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_21-24">22:21-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_8,9">28:8, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_23-30">29:23-30</span>, etc.).<br>Polygamy was acknowledged in the Mosaic law and made the basis of legislation, and continued to be practised all down through the period of Jewish histroy to the Captivity, after which there is no instance of it on record.<br>It seems to have been the practice from the beginning for fathers to select wives for their sons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_3">Genesis 24:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_6">38:6</span>). Sometimes also proposals were initiated by the father of the maiden (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_21">Exodus 2:21</span>). The brothers of the maiden were also sometimes consulted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_51">Genesis 24:51</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_11">34:11</span>), but her own consent was not required. The young man was bound to give a price to the father of the maiden (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_15">31:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_12">34:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_16,17">Exodus 22:16, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_23,25">1 Samuel 18:23, 25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT4_10">Ruth 4:10</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_2">3:2</span>) On these patriarchal customs the Mosaic law made no change.<br>In the pre-Mosaic times, when the proposals were accepted and the marriage price given, the bridegroom could come at once and take away his bride to his own house (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_63-67">Genesis 24:63-67</span>). But in general the marriage was celebrated by a feast in the house of the bride’s parents, to which all friends were invited (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_22,27">29:22, 27</span>); and on the day of the marriage the bride, concealed under a thick veil, was conducted to her future husband’s home.<br>Our Lord corrected many false notions then existing on the subject of marriage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_23-30">Matthew 22:23-30</span>), and placed it as a divine institution on the highest grounds. The apostles state clearly and enforce the nuptial duties of husband and wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_18,19">Colossians 3:18, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P13_1-7">1 Peter 3:1-7</span>). Marriage is said to be “honourable” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_4">Hebrews 13:4</span>), and the prohibition of it is noted as one of the marks of degenerate times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T14_3">1 Timothy 4:3</span>).<br>The marriage relation is used to represent the union between God and his people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS54_5">Isaiah 54:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR3_1-14">Jeremiah 3:1-14</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_9,20">2:9, 20</span>). In the New Testament the same figure is employed in representing the love of Christ to his saints(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_25-27">Ephesians 5:25-27</span>). The Church of the redeemed is the “Bride, the Lamb’s wife” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV19_7-9">Revelation 19:7-9</span>).<br>
