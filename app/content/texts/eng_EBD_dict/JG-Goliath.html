A famous giant of Gath, who for forty days openly defied the armies of Israel, but was at length slain by David with a stone from a sling (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_4">1 Samuel 17:4</span>). He was probably descended from the Rephaim who found refuge among the Philistines after they were dispersed by the Ammonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_20,21">Deuteronomy 2:20, 21</span>). His height was “six cubits and a span,” which, taking the cubit at 21 inches, is equal to 10 1/2 feet.<br>David cut off his head (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_51">1 Samuel 17:51</span>) and brought it to Jerusalem, while he hung the armour which he took from him in his tent. His sword was preserved at Nob as a religious trophy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_9">21:9</span>). David’s victory over Goliath was the turning point in his life. He came into public notice now as the deliverer of Israel and the chief among Saul’s men of war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_5">18:5</span>), and the devoted friend of Jonathan.<br>(2.) In 2 Samuel 21:19 there is another giant of the same name mentioned as slain by Elhanan. The staff of his apear “was like a weaver’s beam.” The Authorized Version interpolates the words “the brother of” from 1 Chronicles 20:5, where this giant is called Lahmi.<br>
