It was at one time a very prosperous and populous island, having a “hundred cities.” The character of the people is described in Paul’s quotation from “one of their own poets” (Epimenides) in his epistle to Titus: “The Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="TT1_12">Titus 1:12</span>). Jews from Crete were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_11">Acts 2:11</span>). The island was visited by Paul on his voyage to Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_">Acts 27</span>). Here Paul subsequently left Titus(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_5">1:5</span>) “to ordain elders.” Some have supposed that it was the original home of the Caphtorim (q.v.) or Philistines.<br>
