In the Old Testament this is used to denote (1) a proverb (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_12">1 Samuel 10:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_13">24:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R27_20">2 Chronicles 7:20</span>), (2) a prophetic utterance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_7">Numbers 23:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK20_49">Ezekiel 20:49</span>), (3) an enigmatic saying(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_2">Psalm 78:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR1_6">Proverbs 1:6</span>). In the New Testament, (1) a proverb (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_17">Mark 7:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK4_23">Luke 4:23</span>), (2) a typical emblem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_9">Hebrews 9:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_19">11:19</span>), (3) a similitude or allegory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_15">Matthew 15:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_32">24:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_23">Mark 3:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_36">Luke 5:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_7">14:7</span>); (4) ordinarily, in a more restricted sense, a comparison of earthly with heavenly things, “an earthly story with a heavenly meaning,” as in the parables of our Lord.<br>Instruction by parables has been in use from the earliest times. A large portion of our Lord’s public teaching consisted of parables. He himself explains his reasons for this in his answer to the inquiry of the disciples,“Why speakest thou to them in parables?” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_13-15"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_13">Matthew 13:13</span>-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK4_11,12">Mark 4:11, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK8_9,10">Luke 8:9, 10</span>). He followed in so doing the rule of the divine procedures, as recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_13">Matthew 13:13</span>.<br>The parables uttered by our Lord are all recorded in the synoptical (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The fourth Gospel contains no parable properly so called, although the illustration of the good shepherd (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_1-16">John 10:1-16</span>) has all the essential features of a parable.
