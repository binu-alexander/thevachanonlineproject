This tree yielded oil which was highly valued. The best oil was from olives that were plucked before being fully ripe, and then beaten or squeezed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_20">Deuteronomy 24:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS17_6">Isaiah 17:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_13">24:13</span>). It was called “beaten,” or “fresh oil” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_20">Exodus 27:20</span>). There were also oil-presses, in which the oil was trodden out by the feet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC6_15">Micah 6:15</span>).<br>James (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC3_12">3:12</span>) calls the fruit “olive berries.” The phrase “vineyards and olives” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG15_5">Judges 15:5</span>, A.V.) should be simply “olive-yard,” or“olive-garden,” as in the Revised Version. (See OIL.)
