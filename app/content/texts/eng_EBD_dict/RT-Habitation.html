Justice and judgment are the habitation of God’s throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_14">Psalm 89:14</span>, Hebrews mekhon, “foundation”), because all his acts are founded on justice and judgment. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_5,13">Psalm 132:5, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_22">Ephesians 2:22</span>, of Canaan, Jerusalem, and the temple as God’s habitation.) God inhabits eternity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS57_15">Isaiah 57:15</span>), i.e., dwells not only among men, but in eternity, where time is unknown; and “the praises of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS22_3">Psalm 22:3</span>), i.e., he dwells among those praises and is continually surrounded by them.<br>
