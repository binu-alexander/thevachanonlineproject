Dogs were used by the Hebrews as a watch for their houses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS56_10">Isaiah 56:10</span>), and for guarding their flocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB30_1">Job 30:1</span>). There were also then as now troops of semi-wild dogs that wandered about devouring dead bodies and the offal of the streets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_11">1 Kings 14:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_4">16:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_19,23">21:19, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_38">22:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS59_6,14">Psalm 59:6, 14</span>).<br>As the dog was an unclean animal, the terms “dog,” “dog’s head,” “dead dog,” were used as terms of reproach or of humiliation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_14">1 Samuel 24:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_8">2 Samuel 3:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S29_8">9:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_9">16:9</span>). Paul calls false apostles “dogs” (Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_2">3:2</span>). Those who are shut out of the kingdom of heaven are also so designated(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV22_15">Revelation 22:15</span>). Persecutors are called “dogs” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS22_16">Psalm 22:16</span>). Hazael’s words, “Thy servant which is but a dog” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_13">2 Kings 8:13</span>), are spoken in mock humility=impossible that one so contemptible as he should attain to such power.<br>
