It has been calculated that in Western Syria and Palestine from two thousand to two thousand five hundred plants are found, of which about five hundred probably are British wild-flowers. Their beauty is often alluded to (Cant. 2:12; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_28">Matthew <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM6_2">6:2</span>8</span>).<br>They are referred to as affording an emblem of the transitory nature of human life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB14_2">Job 14:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS103_15">Psalm 103:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_1">Isaiah 28:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_6">40:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_10">James 1:10</span>).<br>Gardens containing flowers and fragrant herbs are spoken of (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM4_16">4:16</span>; 6:2).<br>
