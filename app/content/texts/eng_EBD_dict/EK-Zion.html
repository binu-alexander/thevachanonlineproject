It was the south-eastern hill of Jerusalem.<br>When David took it from the Jebusites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_63">Joshua 15:63</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_7">2 Samuel 5:7</span>) he built on it a citadel and a palace, and it became “the city of David” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_1">1 Kings 8:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_21,31">2 Kings 19:21, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R111_5">1 Chronicles 11:5</span>). In the later books of the Old Testament this name was sometimes used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS87_2">Psalm 87:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS149_2">149:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS33_14">Isaiah 33:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_1">Joel 2:1</span>) to denote Jerusalem in general, and sometimes God’s chosen Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_18">Psalm 51:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS87_5">87:5</span>).<br>In the New Testament (see SION) it is used sometimes to denote the Church of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB12_22">Hebrews 12:22</span>), and sometimes the heavenly city(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV14_1">Revelation 14:1</span>).<br>
