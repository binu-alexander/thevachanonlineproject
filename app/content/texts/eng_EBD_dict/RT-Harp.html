It was invented by Jubal (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_21">Genesis 4:21</span>). Some think the word kinnor denotes the whole class of stringed instruments. It was used as an accompaniment to songs of cheerfulness as well as of praise to God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_27">Genesis 31:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_23">1 Samuel 16:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_28">2 Chronicles 20:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS33_2">Psalm 33:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS137_2">137:2</span>).<br>In Solomon’s time harps were made of almug-trees (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_11,12">1 Kings 10:11, 12</span>). In 1 Chronicles 15:21 mention is made of “harps on the Sheminith;” Revised Version, “harps set to the Sheminith;” better perhaps “harps of eight strings.” The soothing effect of the music of the harp is referred to 1 Samuel 16:16, 23; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_10">18:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_9">19:9</span>. The church in heaven is represented as celebrating the triumphs of the Redeemer “harping with their harps”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV14_2">Revelation 14:2</span>).<br>
