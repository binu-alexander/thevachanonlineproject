It was applied to “lees” from the custom of allowing wine to stand on the lees that it might thereby be better preserved (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS25_6">Isaiah 25:6</span>). “Men settled on their lees” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_12">Zephaniah 1:12</span>) are men “hardened or crusted.” The image is derived from the crust formed at the bottom of wines long left undisturbed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_11">Jeremiah 48:11</span>). The effect of wealthy undisturbed ease on the ungodly is hardening. They become stupidly secure (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS55_19">Psalm 55:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_1">Amos 6:1</span>). To drink the lees (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8">Psalm 75:8</span>) denotes severe suffering.<br>
