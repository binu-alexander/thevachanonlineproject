He died before his father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_27">Genesis 11:27</span>), in Ur of the Chaldees.<br>(2.) Hebrews haran, i.e., “parched;” or probably from the Accadian charana, meaning “a road.” A celebrated city of Western Asia, now Harran, where Abram remained, after he left Ur of the Chaldees, till his father Terah died (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_31,32">Genesis 11:31, 32</span>), when he continued his journey into the land of Canaan. It is called “Charran” in the LXX. and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_2">Acts 7:2</span>.
