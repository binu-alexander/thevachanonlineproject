It was one of the chief seats of the worship of Dagon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_5">1 Samuel 5:5</span>). It belonged to the tribe of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47">Joshua 15:47</span></span>), but it never came into their actual possession. It was an important city, as it stood on the highroad from Egypt to Palestine, and hence was strongly fortified (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_6">2 Chronicles 26:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_1">Isaiah 20:1</span>). Uzziah took it, but fifty years after his death it was taken by the Assyrians (B.C. 758). According to Sargon’s record, it was captured by him in B.C. 711. The only reference to it in the New Testament, where it is called Azotus, is in the account of Philip’s return from Gaza (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_40">Acts 8:40</span>). It is now called Eshdud.<br>
