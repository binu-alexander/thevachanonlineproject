(1.) Son of Eleazar, the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_25">Exodus 6:25</span>). While yet a youth he distinguished himself at Shittim by his zeal against the immorality into which the Moabites had tempted the people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_1-9">Numbers 25:1-9</span>), and thus “stayed the plague” that had broken out among the people, and by which twenty-four thousand of them perished. For his faithfulness on that occasion he received the divine approbation (10-13). He afterwards commanded the army that went out against the Midianites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_6-8">31:6-8</span>). When representatives of the people were sent to expostulate with the two and a half tribes who, just after crossing Jordan, built an altar and departed without giving any explanation, Phinehas was their leader, and addressed them in the words recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS22_16-20">Joshua 22:16-20</span>. Their explanation follows. This great altar was intended to be all ages only a witness that they still formed a part of Israel. Phinehas was afterwards the chief adviser in the war with the Benjamites. He is commemorated in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS106_30,31">Psalm 106:30, 31</span>. (See ED.)(2.) One of the sons of Eli, the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_3">1 Samuel 1:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_12">2:12</span>). He and his brother Hophni were guilty of great crimes, for which destruction came on the house of Eli (31). He died in battle with the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S14_4,11">1 Samuel 4:4, 11</span>); and his wife, on hearing of his death, gave birth to a son, whom she called “Ichabod,” and then she died (19-22).<br>
