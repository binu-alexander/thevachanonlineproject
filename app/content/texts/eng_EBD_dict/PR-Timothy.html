His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned as eminent for their piety (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>). We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_1">Acts 16:1</span>). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul’s second visit to Lystra (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_2">16:2</span>), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul’s first visit to that place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T23_11">2 Timothy 3:11</span>). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his “own son in the faith,” arranged that he should become his companion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_3">Acts 16:3</span>), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T14_14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_14">Acts 17:14</span>). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_15">17:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H13_2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>). We next find him at Corinth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H11_1">1 Thessalonians <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_1">1:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H21_1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span>) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_22">Acts 19:22</span>), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_4">20:4</span>), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (Phil. 1:1), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_23">Hebrews 13:23</span>). During the apostle’s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>). According to tradition, after the apostle’s death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr’s grave.<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>TIMOTHY</b></div><br>"TIMOTHY", FIRST EPISTLE TO Paul in this epistle speaks of himself as having left Ephesus for Macedonia (1:3), and hence not Laodicea, as mentioned in the subscription; but probably Philippi, or some other city in that region, was the place where this epistle was written. During the interval between his first and second imprisonments he probably visited the scenes of his former labours in Greece and Asia, and then found his way into Macedonia, whence he wrote this letter to Timothy, whom he had left behind in Ephesus.<br>It was probably written about A.D. 66 or 67.<br>The epistle consists mainly, (1) of counsels to Timothy regarding the worship and organization of the Church, and the responsibilities resting on its several members; and (2) of exhortation to faithfulness in maintaining the truth amid surrounding errors.<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>TIMOTHY</b></div><br>"TIMOTHY", SECOND EPISTLE TO was probably written a year or so after the first, and from Rome, where Paul was for a second time a prisoner, and was sent to Timothy by the hands of Tychicus. In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (comp. Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="T22_22">2:22</span>). He was anticipating that “the time of his departure was at hand” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>), and he exhorts his “son Timothy” to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_6-15">1:6-15</span>), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_1-5">4:1-5</span>), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead.<br>
