Hebrews midhbar, denoting not a barren desert but a district or region suitable for pasturing sheep and cattle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS65_12">Psalm 65:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_11">Isaiah 42:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR23_10">Jeremiah 23:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL1_19">Joel 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_22">2:22</span>); an uncultivated place. This word is used of the wilderness of Beersheba (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_14">Genesis 21:14</span>), on the southern border of Palestine; the wilderness of the Red Sea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_18">Exodus 13:18</span>); of Shur (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_22">15:22</span>), a portion of the Sinaitic peninsula; of Sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_1">17:1</span>), Sinai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_38">Leviticus 7:38</span>), Moab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_8">Deuteronomy <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_8">2:8</span></span>), Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_16">Judges 1:16</span>), Ziph, Maon, En-gedi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_14,24">1 Samuel 23:14, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_1">24:1</span>), Jeruel and Tekoa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_16,20">2 Chronicles 20:16, 20</span>), Kadesh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS29_8">Psalm 29:8</span>).<br>“The wilderness of the sea” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS21_1">Isaiah 21:1</span>). Principal Douglas, referring to this expression, says: “A mysterious name, which must be meant to describe Babylon (see especially ver. 9), perhaps because it became the place of discipline to God’s people, as the wilderness of the Red Sea had been (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK20_35">Ezekiel 20:35</span>). Otherwise it is in contrast with the symbolic title in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_1">Isaiah 22:1</span>. Jerusalem is the “valley of vision,” rich in spiritual husbandry; whereas Babylon, the rival centre of influence, is spiritually barren and as restless as the sea (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS57_20">57:20</span>).” A Short Analysis of the O.T.<br>(2.) Jeshimon, a desert waste (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_10">Deuteronomy 32:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_7">Psalm 68:7</span>).<br>(3.) ‘Arabah, the name given to the valley from the Dead Sea to the eastern branch of the Red Sea. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_1">Deuteronomy 1:1</span>; 2:8, it is rendered “plain”(R.V., “Arabah”).<br>(4.) Tziyyah, a “dry place” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_17">Psalm 78:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_41">105:41</span>).<br>(5.) Tohu, a “desolate” place, a place “waste” or “unoccupied”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_10">Deuteronomy 32:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB12_24">Job 12:24</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_2">Genesis 1:2</span>, “without form”). The wilderness region in the Sinaitic peninsula through which for forty years the Hebrews wandered is generally styled “the wilderness of the wanderings.” This entire region is in the form of a triangle, having its base toward the north and its apex toward the south. Its extent from north to south is about 250 miles, and at its widest point it is about 150 miles broad. Throughout this vast region of some 1,500 square miles there is not a single river. The northern part of this triangular peninsula is properly the“wilderness of the wanderings” (et-Tih). The western portion of it is called the “wilderness of Shur” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_22">Exodus 15:22</span>), and the eastern the “wilderness of Paran.” The “wilderness of Judea” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_1">Matthew 3:1</span>) is a wild, barren region, lying between the Dead Sea and the Hebron Mountains. It is the “Jeshimon” mentioned in 1 Samuel 23:19.<br>
