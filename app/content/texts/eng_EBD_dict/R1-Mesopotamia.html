In the Old Testament it is mentioned also under the name “Padan-aram;” i.e., the plain of Aram, or Syria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_20">Genesis 25:20</span>). The northern portion of this fertile plateau was the original home of the ancestors of the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_">Genesis 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_2">Acts 7:2</span>).<br>From this region Isaac obtained his wife Rebecca (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_10">Genesis 24:10</span>, 15), and here also Jacob sojourned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_2-7">28:2-7</span>) and obtained his wives, and here most of his sons were born (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_26">35:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_15">46:15</span>). The petty, independent tribes of this region, each under its own prince, were warlike, and used chariots in battle.<br>They maintained their independence till after the time of David, when they fell under the dominion of Assyria, and were absorbed into the empire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_13">2 Kings 19:13</span>).<br>
