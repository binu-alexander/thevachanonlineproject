A man of Beeroth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S24_2">2 Samuel 4:2</span>), one of the four Gibeonite cities. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_17">Joshua 9:17</span>.)(2.) A Syrian idol, mentioned only in 2 Kings 5:18.<br>(3.) One of the “uttermost cities” of Judah, afterwards given to Simeon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_21,32">Joshua 15:21, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_7">19:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_32">1 Chronicles 4:32</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_32">Joshua 15:32</span> Ain and Rimmon are mentioned separately, but in 19:7 and <span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_32">1 Chronicles 4:32</span>(comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_29">Nehemiah 11:29</span>) the two words are probably to be combined, as forming together the name of one place, Ain-Rimmon=the spring of the pomegranate. It has been identified with Um er-Rumamin, about 13 miles south-west of Hebron.<br>(4.) “Rock of,” to which the Benjamites fled (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_45,47">Judges 20:45, 47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_13">21:13</span>), and where they maintained themselves for four months after the fearful battle at Gibeah, in which they were almost exterminated, 600 only surviving out of about 27,000. It is the present village of Rummon, “on the very edge of the hill country, with a precipitous descent toward the Jordan valley,” supposed to be the site of Ai.<br>
