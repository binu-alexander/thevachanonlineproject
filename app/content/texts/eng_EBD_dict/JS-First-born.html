His son did not succeed or survive his father, but died early. The son’s tomb has been found at Thebes unfinished, showing it was needed earlier than was expected. Some of the records on the tomb are as follows: “The son whom Menephtah loves; who draws towards him his father’s heart, the singer, the prince of archers, who governed Egypt on behalf of his father. Dead.”

</html><br><div class="is"><b>FIRST-BORN</b></div><br>"FIRST-BORN", REDEMPTION OF From the beginning the office of the priesthood in each family belonged to the eldest son. But when the extensive plan of sacrificial worship was introduced, requiring a company of men to be exclusively devoted to this ministry, the primitive office of the first-born was superseded by that of the Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_11-13">Numbers 3:11-13</span>), and it was ordained that the first-born of man and of unclean animals should henceforth be redeemed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_15">18:15</span>).<br>The laws concerning this redemption of the first-born of man are recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_12-15"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_12">Exodus 13:12</span>-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_29">22:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_20">34:20</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_45">Numbers 3:45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU8_17">8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_16">18:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV12_2,4">Leviticus 12:2, 4</span>.<br>The first-born male of every clean animal was to be given up to the priest for sacrifice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_6">Deuteronomy 12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_12">Exodus 13:12</span>; 34:20; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_15-17">Numbers 18:15-17</span>).<br>But the first-born of unclean animals was either to be redeemed or sold and the price given to the priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_11-13,27">Leviticus 27:11-13, 27</span>). The first-born of an ass, if not redeemed, was to be put to death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_13">Exodus 13:13</span>; 34:20).<br>

God claimed that the first-born males of man and of animals should be consecrated to him, the one as a priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_22,24">Exodus 19:22, 24</span>), representing the family to which he belonged, and the other to be offered up in sacrifice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_4">Genesis 4:4</span>).<br>
