</html><br><div class="is"><b>JOEL</b></div><br>"JOEL", BOOK OF Joel was probably a resident in Judah, as his commission was to that people. He makes frequent mention of Judah and Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_14">1:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_1,15,32">2:1, 15, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_1,12,17,20,21">3:1, 12, 17, 20, 21</span>).<br>He probably flourished in the reign of Uzziah (about B.C. 800), and was contemporary with Amos and Isaiah.<br>The contents of this book are, (1.) A prophecy of a great public calamity then impending over the land, consisting of a want of water and an extraordinary plague of locusts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_1-2">1:1-2</span>:11). (2.) The prophet then calls on his countrymen to repent and to turn to God, assuring them of his readiness to forgive (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_12-17">2:12-17</span>), and foretelling the restoration of the land to its accustomed fruitfulness (18-26). (3.) Then follows a Messianic prophecy, quoted by Peter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_39">Acts 2:39</span>). (4.) Finally, the prophet foretells portents and judgments as destined to fall on the enemies of God (ch. 3, but in the Hebrew text 4).<br>
