This is also the rendering of melits, meaning “an interpreter,” in 2 Chronicles 32:31; and of malak, a“messenger,” in 2 Chronicles 35:21; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_4">Isaiah 30:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS33_7">33:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK17_15">Ezekiel 17:15</span>. This is the name used by the apostle as designating those who are appointed by God to declare his will (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_20">Ephesians 6:20</span>).<br>The Hebrews on various occasions and for various purposes had recourse to the services of ambassadors, e.g., to contract alliances (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_4">Joshua 9:4</span></span>), to solicit favours (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_14">Numbers 20:14</span>), to remonstrate when wrong was done(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_12">Judges 11:12</span>), to condole with a young king on the death of his father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_2">2 Samuel 10:2</span>), and to congratulate a king on his accession to the throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_1">1 Kings 5:1</span>).<br>To do injury to an ambassador was to insult the king who sent him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_5">2 Samuel 10:5</span>).<br>
