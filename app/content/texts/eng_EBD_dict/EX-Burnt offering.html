Such were the sacrifices offered by Abel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_3,4">Genesis 4:3, 4</span>, here called minhah; i.e., “a gift”), Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_20">Genesis 8:20</span>), Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_2,7,8,13">Genesis 22:2, 7, 8, 13</span>), and by the Hebrews in Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX10_25">Exodus 10:25</span>).<br>The law of Moses afterwards prescribed the occasions and the manner in which burnt sacrifices were to be offered. There were “the continual burnt offering” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_38-42"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_">Exodus 29</span>:38-42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_9-13">Leviticus 6:9-13</span>), “the burnt offering of every sabbath,” which was double the daily one (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_9,10">Numbers 28:9, 10</span>), “the burnt offering of every month” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_11-15">28:11-15</span>), the offerings at the Passover (19-23), at Pentecost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_16">Leviticus 23:16</span>), the feast of Trumpets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_23-25">23:23-25</span>), and on the day of Atonement (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_">Leviticus 16</span>).<br>On other occasions special sacrifices were offered, as at the consecration of Aaron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_">Exodus 29</span>) and the dedication of the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_5,62-64">1 Kings 8:5, 62-64</span>).<br>Free-will burnt offerings were also permitted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV1_13">Leviticus 1:13</span>), and were offered at the accession of Solomon to the throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_21">1 Chronicles 29:21</span>), and at the reformation brought about by Hezekiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_31-35">2 Chronicles 29: 31-35</span>).<br>These offerings signified the complete dedication of the offerers unto God.<br>This is referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM12_1">Romans 12:1</span>.
