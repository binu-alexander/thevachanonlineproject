To the rearing and management of them the inhabitants chiefly devoted themselves (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_13">Deuteronomy 8:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_21">12:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_5">1 Samuel 11:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S112_3">12:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS144_14">Psalm 144:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR3_24">Jeremiah 3:24</span>). They may be classified as,(1.) Neat cattle. Many hundreds of these were yearly consumed in sacrifices or used for food. The finest herds were found in Bashan, beyond Jordan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_4">Numbers 32:4</span>). Large herds also pastured on the wide fertile plains of Sharon. They were yoked to the plough (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_19">1 Kings 19:19</span>), and were employed for carrying burdens (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_40"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_40">1 Chronicles 12:40</span></span>). They were driven with a pointed rod (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_31">Judges 3:31</span>) or goad (q.v.).<br>According to the Mosaic law, the mouths of cattle employed for the threshing-floor were not to be muzzled, so as to prevent them from eating of the provender over which they trampled (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_4">Deuteronomy 25:4</span>).<br>Whosoever stole and sold or slaughtered an ox must give five in satisfaction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_1">Exodus 22:1</span>); but if it was found alive in the possession of him who stole it, he was required to make double restitution only (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_4">22:4</span>). If an ox went astray, whoever found it was required to bring it back to its owner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_4">23:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_1,4">Deuteronomy 22:1, 4</span>). An ox and an ass could not be yoked together in the plough (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span>).<br>(2.) Small cattle. Next to herds of neat cattle, sheep formed the most important of the possessions of the inhabitants of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16">Genesis 12:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_5">13:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_14">26:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_27">21:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_2,3">29:2, 3</span>). They are frequently mentioned among the booty taken in war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_32">Numbers 31:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_21">Joshua 6:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_32">1 Samuel 14:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_3">15:3</span>). There were many who were owners of large flocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_2">1 Samuel 25:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_2">2 Samuel 12:2</span>, comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_3">Job 1:3</span>). Kings also had shepherds “over their flocks”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_31">1 Chronicles 27:31</span>), from which they derived a large portion of their revenue (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_29">2 Samuel 17:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_40"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_40">1 Chronicles 12:40</span></span>). The districts most famous for their flocks of sheep were the plain of Sharon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS65_10">Isaiah 65: 10</span>), Mount Carmel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC7_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MC7_14">Micah 7:14</span></span>), Bashan and Gilead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC7_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MC7_14">Micah 7:14</span></span>). In patriarchal times the flocks of sheep were sometimes tended by the daughters of the owners. Thus Rachel, the daughter of Laban, kept her father’s sheep(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_9">Genesis 29:9</span>); as also Zipporah and her six sisters had charge of their father Jethro’s flocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_16">Exodus 2:16</span>). Sometimes they were kept by hired shepherds (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_12">John 10:12</span></span>), and sometimes by the sons of the family (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_11">1 Samuel 16:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_15">17:15</span>). The keepers so familiarized their sheep with their voices that they knew them, and followed them at their call. Sheep, but more especially rams and lambs, were frequently offered in sacrifice. The shearing of sheep was a great festive occasion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_4">1 Samuel 25:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S213_23">2 Samuel 13:23</span>). They were folded at night, and guarded by their keepers against the attacks of the lion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC5_8">Micah 5:8</span>), the bear (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_34">1 Samuel 17:34</span>), and the wolf(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_16">Matthew 10:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_12">John 10:12</span></span>). They were liable to wander over the wide pastures and go astray (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_176">Psalm 119:176</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS53_6">Isaiah 53:6</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS4_16">4:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_12">Matthew 18:12</span>).<br>Goats also formed a part of the pastoral wealth of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_9">Genesis 15:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_14">32:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_31">37:31</span>). They were used both for sacrifice and for food(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_4">Deuteronomy 14:4</span>), especially the young males (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_9,14,17">Genesis 27:9, 14, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_19">Judges 6:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_15">13:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_20">1 Samuel 16:20</span>). Goat’s hair was used for making tent cloth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_7">Exodus 26:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX36_14">36:14</span>), and for mattresses and bedding (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_13,16">1 Samuel 19:13, 16</span>).
