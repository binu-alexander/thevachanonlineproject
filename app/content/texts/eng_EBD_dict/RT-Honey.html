Hebrews ya’ar, occurs only 1 Samuel 14:25, 27, 29; Cant.<br>5:1, where it denotes the honey of bees. Properly the word signifies a forest or copse, and refers to honey found in woods.<br>(2.) Nopheth, honey that drops (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_10">Psalm 19:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR5_3">Proverbs 5:3</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR4_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR4_11">4:11</span></span>).<br>(3.) Debash denotes bee-honey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_8">Judges 14:8</span>); but also frequently a vegetable honey distilled from trees (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_11">Genesis 43:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_17">Ezekiel 27:17</span>). In these passages it may probably mean “dibs,” or syrup of grapes, i.e., the juice of ripe grapes boiled down to one-third of its bulk.<br>(4.) Tsuph, the cells of the honey-comb full of honey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR16_24">Proverbs 16:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_10">Psalm 19:10</span></span>).<br>(5.) “Wild honey” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_4">Matthew 3:4</span>) may have been the vegetable honey distilled from trees, but rather was honey stored by bees in rocks or in trees (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_13">Deuteronomy 32:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS81_16">Psalm 81:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_25-29">1 Samuel 14:25-29</span>).<br>Canaan was a “land flowing with milk and honey” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_8">Exodus 3:8</span>). Milk and honey were among the chief dainties in the earlier ages, as they are now among the Bedawin; and butter and honey are also mentioned among articles of food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_15">Isaiah 7:15</span>). The ancients used honey instead of sugar(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_103">Psalm 119:103</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR24_13">Proverbs 24:13</span>); but when taken in great quantities it caused nausea, a fact referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR25_16,17">Proverbs 25:16, 17</span> to inculcate moderation in pleasures. Honey and milk also are put for sweet discourse(Cant. 4:11).<br>
