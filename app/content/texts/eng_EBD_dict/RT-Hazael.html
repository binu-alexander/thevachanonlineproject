The Assyrians soon after his accession to the throne came against him and defeated him with very great loss; and three years afterwards again invaded Syria, but on this occasion Hazael submitted to them. He then turned his arms against Israel, and ravaged “all the land of Gilead,” etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_33">2 Kings 10:33</span>), which he held in a degree of subjection to him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_3-7,22">13:3-7, 22</span>). He aimed at the subjugation also of the kingdom of Judah, when Joash obtained peace by giving him “all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord, and in the king’s house” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K212_18">2 Kings 12:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R224_24">2 Chronicles 24:24</span>). He reigned about forty-six years (B.C.886-840), and was succeeded on the throne by his son Ben-hadad (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_22-25">2 Kings 13:22-25</span>), who on several occasions was defeated by Jehoash, the king of Israel, and compelled to restore all the land of Israel his father had taken.<br>
