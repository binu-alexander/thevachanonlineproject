A “beer” was a deep shaft, bored far under the rocky surface by the art of man, which contained water which percolated through the strata in its sides. Such wells were those of Jacob and Beersheba, etc. (see <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_19,25,30,31">Genesis 21:19, 25, 30, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_11">24:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_15,18-25,32">26:15, 18-25, 32</span>, etc.). In the Pentateuch this word beer, so rendered, occurs twenty-five times.<br>
