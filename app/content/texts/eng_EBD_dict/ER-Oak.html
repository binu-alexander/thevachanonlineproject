The LXX.<br>renders by “terebinth.” In the plural form this word occurs in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_29">Isaiah 1:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS57_5">57:5</span> (A.V. marg. and R.V., “among the oaks”); <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS61_3">61:3</span> (“trees”). The word properly means strongly, mighty, and hence a strong tree.<br>(2.) ‘Elah, <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_4">Genesis 35:4</span>, “under the oak which was by Shechem” (R.V.<br>marg., “terebinth”). <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS6_13">Isaiah 6:13</span>, A.V., “teil-tree;” R.V., “terebinth.” <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_30">Isaiah 1:30</span>, R.V. marg., “terebinth.” Absalom in his flight was caught in the branches of a “great oak” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_9">2 Samuel 18:9</span>; R.V. marg., “terebinth”).<br>(3.) ‘Elon, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_11">Judges 4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_6">9:6</span> (R.V., “oak;” A.V., following the Targum,“plain”) properly the deciduous species of oak shedding its foliage in autumn.<br>(4.) ‘Elan, only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN4_11,14,20">Daniel 4:11,14,20</span>, rendered “tree” in Nebuchadnezzar’s dream. Probably some species of the oak is intended.<br>(5.) ‘Allah, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_26">Joshua 24:26</span>. The place here referred to is called Allon-moreh(“the oak of Moreh,” as in R.V.) in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_6">Genesis 12:6</span> and 35:4.<br>(6.) ‘Allon, always rendered “oak.” Probably the evergreen oak (called also ilex and holm oak) is intended. The oak woods of Bashan are frequently alluded to (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_13">Isaiah 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_6">Ezekiel 27:6</span>). Three species of oaks are found in Palestine, of which the “prickly evergreen oak” (Quercus coccifera) is the most abundant. “It covers the rocky hills of Palestine with a dense brushwood of trees from 8 to 12 feet high, branching from the base, thickly covered with small evergreen rigid leaves, and bearing acorns copiously.” The so-called Abraham’s oak at Hebron is of this species. Tristram says that this oak near Hebron “has for several centuries taken the place of the once renowned terebinth which marked the site of Mamre on the other side of the city. The terebinth existed at Mamre in the time of Vespasian, and under it the captive Jews were sold as slaves. It disappeared about A.D.<br>330, and no tree now marks the grove of Mamre. The present oak is the noblest tree in Southern Palestine, being 23 feet in girth, and the diameter of the foliage, which is unsymmetrical, being about 90 feet.” (See HEBRON; TEIL-TREE.)
