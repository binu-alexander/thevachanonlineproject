A son of Salu, slain by Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, because of his wickedness in bringing a Midianitish woman into his tent (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_6-15">Numbers 25:6-15</span>).<br>(2.) Murdered Elah at Tirzah, and succeeded him on the throne of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_8-10">1 Kings 16:8-10</span>). He reigned only seven days, for Omri, whom the army elected as king, laid siege to Tirzah, whereupon Zimri set fire to the palace and perished amid its ruins (11-20). Omri succeeded to the throne only after four years of fierce war with Tibni, another claimant to the throne.<br>
