In <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_24-27">Matthew 17:24-27</span> the word denotes the temple rate (the “didrachma,” the “half-shekel,” as rendered by the R.V.) which was required to be paid for the support of the temple by every Jew above twenty years of age (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_12">Exodus 30:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K212_4">2 Kings 12:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R224_6,9">2 Chronicles 24:6, 9</span>). It was not a civil but a religious tax.<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_17">Matthew 22:17</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK12_14">Mark 12:14</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_22">Luke 20:22</span>, the word may be interpreted as denoting the capitation tax which the Romans imposed on the Jewish people. It may, however, be legitimately regarded as denoting any tax whatever imposed by a foreign power on the people of Israel. The “tribute money” shown to our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_19">Matthew 22:19</span>) was the denarius, bearing Caesar’s superscription. It was the tax paid by every Jew to the Romans.<br>(See PENNY.)
