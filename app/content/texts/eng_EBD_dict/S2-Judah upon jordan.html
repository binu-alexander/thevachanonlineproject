It has been suggested that, following the Masoretic punctuation, the expression should read thus,“and Judah; the Jordan was toward the sun-rising.” The sixty cities(Havoth-jair, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_41">Numbers 32:41</span>) on the east of Jordan were reckoned as belonging to Judah, because Jair, their founder, was a Manassite only on his mother’s side, but on his father’s side of the tribe of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_5,21-23">1 Chronicles 2:5, 21-23</span>).<br>
