Viewed generally, it is benevolence; as exercised with respect to the miseries of his creatures it is mercy, pity, compassion, and in the case of impenitent sinners, long-suffering patience; as exercised in communicating favour on the unworthy it is grace.<br>“Goodness and justice are the several aspects of one unchangeable, infinitely wise, and sovereign moral perfection. God is not sometimes merciful and sometimes just, but he is eternally infinitely just and merciful.” God is infinitely and unchangeably good (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP3_17">Zephaniah 3:17</span>), and his goodness is incomprehensible by the finite mind (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_35,36">Romans 11: 35, 36</span>).<br>“God’s goodness appears in two things, giving and forgiving.”
