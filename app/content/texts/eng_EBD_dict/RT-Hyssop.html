It is spoken of as a plant “springing out of the wall” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_33">1 Kings 4:33</span>).<br>Many conjectures have been formed as to what this plant really was. Some contend that it was a species of marjoram (origanum), six species of which are found in Palestine. Others with more probability think that it was the caper plant, the Capparis spinosa of Linnaeus. This plant grew in Egypt, in the desert of Sinai, and in Palestine. It was capable of producing a stem three or four feet in length (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_48">Matthew 27:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_36">Mark 15:36</span>.
