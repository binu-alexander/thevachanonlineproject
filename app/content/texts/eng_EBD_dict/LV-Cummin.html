Its fruit is mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_25,27">Isaiah 28:25, 27</span>. In the New Testament it is mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_23">Matthew 23:23</span>, where our Lord pronounces a “woe” on the scribes and Pharisees, who were zealous in paying tithes of “mint and anise and cummin,” while they omitted the weightier matters of the law.”“It is used as a spice, both bruised, to mix with bread, and also boiled, in the various messes and stews which compose an Oriental banquet.” Tristram, Natural History.<br>
