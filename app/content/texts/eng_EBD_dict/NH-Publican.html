In order to collect the taxes, the publicans employed subordinates (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_27">5:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_1">15:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_10">18:10</span>), who, for their own ends, were often guilty of extortion and peculation. In New Testament times these taxes were paid to the Romans, and hence were regarded by the Jews as a very heavy burden, and hence also the collectors of taxes, who were frequently Jews, were hated, and were usually spoken of in very opprobrious terms. Jesus was accused of being a “friend of publicans and sinners” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_34">Luke 7:34</span>).<br>
