The son of Zebedee and Salome; an elder brother of John the apostle. He was one of the twelve. He was by trade a fisherman, in partnership with Peter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20">Matthew 20:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_56">27:56</span>). With John and Peter he was present at the transfiguration (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_2">Mark 9:2</span>), at the raising of Jairus’s daughter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_37-43">Mark 5:37-43</span>), and in the garden with our Lord(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_33">14:33</span>). Because, probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were called Boanerges, i.e., “sons of thunder.” He was the first martyr among the apostles, having been beheaded by King Herod Agrippa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_1,2">Acts 12:1, 2</span>), A.D. 44. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20-23">20:20-23</span>).<br>(2.) The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas, “the brother” or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_18,19">Galatians 1:18, 19</span>), called James “the Less,” or “the Little,” probably because he was of low stature. He is mentioned along with the other apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_3">Matthew 10:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_18">Mark 3:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_15">Luke 6:15</span>). He had a separate interview with our Lord after his resurrection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span>), and is mentioned as one of the apostles of the circumcision (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_13">Acts 1:13</span>). He appears to have occupied the position of head of the Church at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council held to consider the case of the Gentiles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_13-29">15:13-29</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_18-24">21:18-24</span>). This James was the author of the epistle which bears his name.<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>JAMES</b></div><br>"JAMES", EPISTLE OF (1.) Author of, was James the Less, the Lord’s brother, one of the twelve apostles. He was one of the three pillars of the Church (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_9">Galatians 2:9</span>).<br>(2.) It was addressed to the Jews of the dispersion, “the twelve tribes scattered abroad.”(3.) The place and time of the writing of the epistle were Jerusalem, where James was residing, and, from internal evidence, the period between Paul’s two imprisonments at Rome, probably about A.D. 62.<br>(4.) The object of the writer was to enforce the practical duties of the Christian life. “The Jewish vices against which he warns them are, formalism, which made the service of God consist in washings and outward ceremonies, whereas he reminds them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_2">1:2</span>7</span>) that it consists rather in active love and purity; fanaticism, which, under the cloak of religious zeal, was tearing Jerusalem in pieces (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_20">1:20</span>); fatalism, which threw its sins on God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_13">1:13</span>); meanness, which crouched before the rich (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_2">2:2</span>); falsehood, which had made words and oaths play-things (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_2-12">3:2-12</span>); partisanship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_14">3:14</span>); evil speaking (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_11">4:11</span>); boasting (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_16">4:16</span>); oppression (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_4">5:4</span>). The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good works (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_22-25">1:22-25</span>), patience under provocation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_17">3:17</span>), patience under oppression (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_7">5:7</span>), patience under persecution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_10">5:10</span>); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_8">5:8</span>).”“Justification by works,” which James contends for, is justification before man, the justification of our profession of faith by a consistent life. Paul contends for the doctrine of “justification by faith;” but that is justification before God, a being regarded and accepted as just by virtue of the righteousness of Christ, which is received by faith.<br>
