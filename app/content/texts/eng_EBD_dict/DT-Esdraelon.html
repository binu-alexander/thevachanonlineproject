It is drained by “that ancient river” the Kishon, which flows westward to the Mediterranean. From the foot of Mount Tabor it branches out into three valleys, that on the north passing between Tabor and Little Hermon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_14">Judges 4:14</span>); that on the south between Mount Gilboa and En-gannim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_27">2 Kings 9:27</span>); while the central portion, the“valley of Jezreel” proper, runs into the Jordan valley (which is about 1,000 feet lower than Esdraelon) by Bethshean. Here Gideon gained his great victory over the Midianites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_1-25">Judges 7:1-25</span>). Here also Barak defeated Sisera, and Saul’s army was defeated by the Philistines, and king Josiah, while fighting in disguise against Necho, king of Egypt, was slain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R235_20-27">2 Chronicles 35:20-27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_-29">2 Kings 23-29</span>). This plain has been well called the“battle-field of Palestine.” “It has been a chosen place for encampment in every contest carried on in this country, from the days of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyrians, in the history of whose wars with Arphaxad it is mentioned as the Great Plain of Esdraelon, until the disastrous march of Napoleon Bonaparte from Egypt into Syria. Jews, Gentiles, Saracens, Crusaders, Frenchmen, Egyptians, Persians, Druses, Turks, and Arabs, warriors out of every nation which is under heaven, have pitched their tents in the plain, and have beheld the various banners of their nations wet with the dews of Tabor and Hermon” (Dr. Clark).<br>
