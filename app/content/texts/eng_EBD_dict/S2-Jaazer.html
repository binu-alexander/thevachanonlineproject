It was allotted to the Merarite Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_39">21:39</span>). In David’s time it was occupied by the Hebronites, i.e., the descendants of Kohath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R126_31">1 Chronicles 26:31</span>). It is mentioned in the “burdens” proclaimed over Moab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS16_8,9">Isaiah 16:8, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_32">Jeremiah 48:32</span>). Its site is marked by the modern ruin called Sar or Seir, about 10 miles west of Amman, and 12 from Heshbon. “The vineyards that once covered the hill-sides are gone; and the wild Bedawin from the eastern desert make cultivation of any kind impossible.”
