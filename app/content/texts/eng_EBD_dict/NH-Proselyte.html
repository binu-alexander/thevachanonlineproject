</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Proselyte" ><div class="is"><b>PROSELYTE</b></div><br>"PROSELYTE "is used in the LXX. for “stranger” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_2">1 Chronicles 22:2</span></span>), i.e., a comer to Palestine; a sojourner in the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_48">Exodus 12:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_10">20:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_21">22:21</span>), and in the New Testament for a convert to Judaism. There were such converts from early times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS56_3">Isaiah 56:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH10_28">Nehemiah 10:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET8_17">Esther 8:17</span>). The law of Moses made specific regulations regarding the admission into the Jewish church of such as were not born Israelites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_10">Exodus 20:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_12">23:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19,48">12:19, 48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT5_14">Deuteronomy 5:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_11,14">16:11, 14</span>, etc.). The Kenites, the Gibeonites, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites were thus admitted to the privileges of Israelites. Thus also we hear of individual proselytes who rose to positions of prominence in Israel, as of Doeg the Edomite, Uriah the Hittite, Araunah the Jebusite, Zelek the Ammonite, Ithmah and Ebedmelech the Ethiopians.<br>In the time of Solomon there were one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred strangers in the land of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_2">1 Chronicles 22:2</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R22_17,18">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</span>). And the prophets speak of the time as coming when the strangers shall share in all the privileges of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK47_22">Ezekiel 47:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_2">Isaiah 2:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_10">11:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS56_3-6">56:3-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC4_1">Micah 4:1</span>). Accordingly, in New Testament times, we read of proselytes in the synagogues, (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_2,7">Acts 10:2, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_42,43,50">13:42, 43, 50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_4">17:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_7">18:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_5">Luke 7:5</span>). The “religious proselytes” here spoken of were proselytes of righteousness, as distinguished from proselytes of the gate.<br>The distinction between “proselytes of the gate” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_10">Exodus 20:10</span></span>) and“proselytes of righteousness” originated only with the rabbis. According to them, the “proselytes of the gate” (half proselytes) were not required to be circumcised nor to comply with the Mosaic ceremonial law. They were bound only to conform to the so-called seven precepts of Noah, viz., to abstain from idolatry, blasphemy, bloodshed, uncleaness, the eating of blood, theft, and to yield obedience to the authorities. Besides these laws, however, they were required to abstain from work on the Sabbath, and to refrain from the use of leavened bread during the time of the Passover.<br>The “proselytes of righteousness”, religious or devout proselytes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_43">Acts <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_43">13:43</span></span>), were bound to all the doctrines and precepts of the Jewish economy, and were members of the synagogue in full communion.<br>The name “proselyte” occurs in the New Testament only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_15">Matthew 23:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_10">Acts 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_5">6:5</span>; 13:43. The name by which they are commonly designated is that of “devout men,” or men “fearing God” or “worshipping God.”
