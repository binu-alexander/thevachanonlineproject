These meals were in the days of Christ usually called “suppers,” after the custom of the Romans, and were partaken of toward the close of the day. It was usual to send a second invitation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_3">Matthew 22:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_17">Luke 14:17</span>) to those who had been already invited. When the whole company was assembled, the master of the house shut the door with his own hands (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_25">Luke 13:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_10">Matthew 25:10</span>).<br>The guests were first refreshed with water and fragrant oil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_38">Luke 7:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_4">Mark 7:4</span>). A less frequent custom was that of supplying each guest with a robe to be worn during the feast (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_8">Ecclesiastes 9:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_4,5">Revelation 3:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_11">Matthew 22:11</span>). At private banquets the master of the house presided; but on public occasions a “governor of the feast” was chosen (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN2_8">John 2:8</span>).<br>The guests were placed in order according to seniority (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_33">Genesis 43:33</span>), or according to the rank they held (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR25_6,7">Proverbs 25:6,7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_6">Matthew 23:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_7">Luke 14:7</span>).<br>As spoons and knives and forks are a modern invention, and were altogether unknown in the East, the hands alone were necessarily used, and were dipped in the dish, which was common to two of the guests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN13_26">John 13:26</span>). In the days of our Lord the guests reclined at table; but the ancient Israelites sat around low tables, cross-legged, like the modern Orientals.<br>Guests were specially honoured when extra portions were set before them(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_34">Genesis 43:34</span>), and when their cup was filled with wine till it ran over(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS23_5">Psalm 23:5</span>). The hands of the guests were usually cleaned by being rubbed on bread, the crumbs of which fell to the ground, and were the portion for dogs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_27">Matthew 15:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_21">Luke 16:21</span>).<br>At the time of the three annual festivals at Jerusalem family banquets were common. To these the “widow, and the fatherless, and the stranger” were welcome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_11">Deuteronomy 16:11</span>). Sacrifices also included a banquet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_15">Exodus 34:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_23">Judges 16:23</span>). Birthday banquets are mentioned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN40_20">Genesis 40:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_6">Matthew 14:6</span>). They were sometimes protracted, and attended with revelry and excess (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_8">Genesis 21:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_22">29:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_2,36">1 Samuel 25:2,36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S213_23">2 Samuel 13:23</span>). Portions were sometimes sent from the table to poorer friends(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_10">Nehemiah 8:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET9_19,22">Esther 9:19, 22</span>).
