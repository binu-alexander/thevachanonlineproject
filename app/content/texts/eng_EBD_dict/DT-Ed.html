The words are literally rendered:“And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad named the altar. It is a witness between us that Jehovah is God.” This great altar stood probably on the east side of the Jordan, in the land of Gilead, “over against the land of Canaan.” After the division of the Promised Land, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, on returning to their own settlements on the east of Jordan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS22_1-6">Joshua 22:1-6</span>), erected a great altar, which they affirmed, in answer to the challenge of the other tribes, was not for sacrifice, but only as a witness (‘Ed) or testimony to future generations that they still retained the same interest in the nation as the other tribes.<br>
