This word is used of Elijah’s mantle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_13,19">1 Kings 19:13, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_8,13">2 Kings 2:8, 13</span>, etc.), which was probably a sheepskin. It appears to have been his only garment, a strip of skin or leather binding it to his loins. ’Addereth twice occurs with the epithet “hairy” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_25">Genesis 25:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC13_4">Zechariah 13:4</span>, R.V.). It is the word denoting the “goodly Babylonish garment” which Achan coveted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_21">Joshua 7:21</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews me’il, frequently applied to the “robe of the ephod” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_4,31">Exodus 28:4, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV8_7">Leviticus 8:7</span>), which was a splendid under tunic wholly of blue, reaching to below the knees. It was woven without seam, and was put on by being drawn over the head. It was worn not only by priests but by kings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_4">1 Samuel 24:4</span>), prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_27">15:27</span>), and rich men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_20">Job 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB2_12">2:12</span>).<br>This was the “little coat” which Samuel’s mother brought to him from year to year to Shiloh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_19">1 Samuel 2:19</span>), a miniature of the official priestly robe.<br>(3.) Semikah, “a rug,” the garment which Jael threw as a covering over Sisera (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_18">Judges 4:18</span>). The Hebrew word occurs nowhere else in Scripture.<br>(4.) Maataphoth, plural, only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span>, denoting a large exterior tunic worn by females. (See DRESS.)
