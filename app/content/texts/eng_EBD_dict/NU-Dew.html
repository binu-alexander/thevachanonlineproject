From May till October rain is unknown, the sun shining with unclouded brightness day after day. The heat becomes intense, the ground hard, and vegetation would perish but for the moist west winds that come each night from the sea. The bright skies cause the heat of the day to radiate very quickly into space, so that the nights are as cold as the day is the reverse, a peculiarity of climate from which poor Jacob suffered thousands of years ago (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_40">Genesis 31:40</span>). To this coldness of the night air the indispensable watering of all plant-life is due. The winds, loaded with moisture, are robbed of it as they pass over the land, the cold air condensing it into drops of water, which fall in a gracious rain of mist on every thirsty blade. In the morning the fog thus created rests like a sea over the plains, and far up the sides of the hills, which raise their heads above it like so many islands. At sunrise, however, the scene speedily changes. By the kindling light the mist is transformed into vast snow-white clouds, which presently break into separate masses and rise up the mountain-sides, to disappear in the blue above, dissipated by the increasing heat. These are ‘the morning clouds and the early dew that go away’ of which Hosea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN6_4">6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_3">13:3</span>) speaks so touchingly” (Geikie’s The Holy Land, etc., i., p. 72). Dew is a source of great fertility (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_28">Genesis 27:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_13">Deuteronomy 33:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC8_12">Zechariah 8:12</span>), and its withdrawal is regarded as a curse from God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_21">2 Samuel 1:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_1">1 Kings 17:1</span>). It is the symbol of a multitude (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_12">2 Samuel 17:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS110_3">Psalm 110:3</span>); and from its refreshing influence it is an emblem of brotherly love and harmony (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS133_3">Psalm 133:3</span>), and of rich spiritual blessings (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS14_5">14:5</span>).<br>
