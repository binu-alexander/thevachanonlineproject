The son of Shaphan, and one of the Levites of the temple in the time of Jehoiakim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_10">Jeremiah 36:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K222_12">2 Kings 22:12</span>). Baruch read aloud to the people from Gemariahâ€™s chamber, and again in the hearing of Gemariah and other scribes, the prophecies of Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_11-20">Jeremiah 36:11-20</span>), which filled him with terror. He joined with others in entreating the king not to destroy the roll of the prophecies which Baruch had read (21-25).<br>(2.) The son of Hilkiah, who accompanied Shaphan with the tribute-money from Zedekiah to Nebuchadnezzar, and was the bearer at the same time of a letter from Jeremiah to the Jewish captives at Babylon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR29_3,4">Jeremiah 29:3, 4</span>).<br>
