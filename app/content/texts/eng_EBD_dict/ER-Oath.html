God is represented as taking an oath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB6_16-18">Hebrews 6:16-18</span>), so also Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_64">Matthew 26:64</span>), and Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_1">Romans 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_20">Galatians 1:20</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_8">1:8</span>). The precept, “Swear not at all,” refers probably to ordinary conversation between man and man(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_34,37">Matthew 5:34,37</span>). But if the words are taken as referring to oaths, then their intention may have been to show “that the proper state of Christians is to require no oaths; that when evil is expelled from among them every yea and nay will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow.”
