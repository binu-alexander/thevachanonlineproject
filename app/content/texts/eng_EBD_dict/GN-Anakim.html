They dwelt in the south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of Hebron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_2">Genesis 23:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_13">Joshua 15:13</span>). In the days of Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_5,6">Genesis 14:5, 6</span>) they inhabited the region afterwards known as Edom and Moab, east of the Jordan. They were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of Palestine before the Canaanites, a Cushite tribe from Babel, and of the same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian shepherd kings. Their formidable warlike appearance, as described by the spies sent to search the land, filled the Israelites with terror. They seem to have identified them with the Nephilim, the “giants” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN6_4">Genesis 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_33"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_33">Numbers 13:33</span></span>) of the antediluvian age. There were various tribes of Anakim(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_14">Joshua 15:14</span>). Joshua finally expelled them from the land, except a remnant that found a refuge in the cities of Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_22">Joshua 11:22</span>). The Philistine giants whom David encountered (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_15-22">2 Samuel 21:15-22</span>) were descendants of the Anakim. (See GIANTS.)
