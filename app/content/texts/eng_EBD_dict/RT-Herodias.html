While residing at Rome with her husband Herod Philip I. and her daughter, Herod Antipas fell in with her during one of his journeys to that city. She consented to leave her husband and become his wife. Some time after, Herod met John the Baptist, who boldly declared the marriage to be unlawful. For this he was “cast into prison,” in the castle probably of Machaerus (q.v.), and was there subsequently beheaded.<br>
