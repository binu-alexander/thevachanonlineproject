The first mention of it is in the history of Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_20">Genesis 9:20</span>). It is afterwards frequently noticed both in the Old and New Testaments, and in the ruins of terraced vineyards there are evidences that it was extensively cultivated by the Jews. It was cultivated in Palestine before the Israelites took possession of it. The men sent out by Moses brought with them from the Valley of Eshcol a cluster of grapes so large that “they bare it between two upon a staff” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_23">Numbers 13: 23</span>). The vineyards of En-gedi (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_14">1:14</span>), Heshbon, Sibmah, Jazer, Elealeh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS16_8-10">Isaiah 16:8-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_32,34">Jeremiah 48:32, 34</span>), and Helbon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_18">Ezekiel 27:18</span>), as well as of Eshcol, were celebrated.<br>The Church is compared to a vine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS80_8">Psalm 80:8</span>), and Christ says of himself, “I am the vine” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN15_1">John 15:1</span>). In one of his parables also (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_33">Matthew 21:33</span>) our Lord compares his Church to a vineyard which “a certain householder planted, and hedged round about,” etc.<br>Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_1">10:1</span> is rendered in the Revised Version, “Israel is a luxuriant vine, which putteth forth his fruit,” instead of “Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself,” of the Authorized Version.<br>
