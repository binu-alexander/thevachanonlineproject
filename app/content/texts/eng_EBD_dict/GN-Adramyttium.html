The ship in which Paul embarked at Caesarea belonged to this city (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_2">Acts 27:2</span>). He was conveyed in it only to Myra, in Lycia, whence he sailed in an Alexandrian ship to Italy. It was a rare thing for a ship to sail from any port of Palestine direct for Italy.
