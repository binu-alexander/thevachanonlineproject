The Lord dwelt in the cloud upon the mercy-seat (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_12">1 Kings 8:12</span>), the cloud of glory. When the psalmist (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS97_2">Psalm 97:2</span>) describes the inscrutable nature of God’s workings among the sons of men, he says, “Clouds and darkness are round about him.” God dwells in thick darkness.<br>Darkness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_9,10">Isaiah 13:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_29">Matthew 24:29</span>) also is a symbol of the judgments that attend on the coming of the Lord. It is a symbol of misery and adversity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB18_6">Job 18:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS107_10">Psalm 107:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS8_22">Isaiah 8:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK30_18">Ezekiel 30:18</span>). The“day of darkness” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_2">Joel 2:2</span>, caused by clouds of locusts, is a symbol of the obscurity which overhangs all divine proceedings. “Works of darkness” are impure actions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_11">Ephesians 5:11</span>). “Outer darkness” refers to the darkness of the streets in the East, which are never lighted up by any public or private lamps after nightfall, in contrast with the blaze of cheerful light in the house. It is also a symbol of ignorance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_2">Isaiah 9:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS60_2">60:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_23">Matthew 6:23</span>) and of death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB10_21">Job 10:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB17_13">17:13</span>).<br>
