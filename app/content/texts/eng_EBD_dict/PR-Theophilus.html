Nothing beyond this is known of him. From the fact that Luke applies to him the title “most excellent”, the same title Paul uses in addressing Felix (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_26">Acts 23:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC24_3">24:3</span>) and Festus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC26_25">26:25</span>), it has been concluded that Theophilus was a person of rank, perhaps a Roman officer.<br>
