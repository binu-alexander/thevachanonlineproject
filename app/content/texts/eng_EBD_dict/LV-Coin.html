They made use of uncoined shekels or talents of silver, which they weighed out(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_16">Genesis 23:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX38_24">Exodus 38:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_12">2 Samuel 18:12</span>). Probably the silver ingots used in the time of Abraham may have been of a fixed weight, which was in some way indicated on them. The “pieces of silver” paid by Abimelech to Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_16">Genesis 20:16</span>), and those also for which Joseph was sold(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_28">37:28</span>), were proably in the form of rings. The shekel was the common standard of weight and value among the Hebrews down to the time of the Captivity. Only once is a shekel of gold mentioned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_25">1 Chronicles 21:25</span>).<br>The “six thousand of gold” mentioned in the transaction between Naaman and Gehazi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_5">2 Kings 5:5</span>) were probably so many shekels of gold. The“piece of money” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB42_11">Job 42:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN33_19">Genesis 33:19</span> (marg., “lambs”) was the Hebrew kesitah, probably an uncoined piece of silver of a certain weight in the form of a sheep or lamb, or perhaps having on it such an impression. The same Hebrew word is used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_32">Joshua 24:32</span>, which is rendered by Wickliffe “an hundred yonge scheep.”
