Here the tower of Babel was built (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_1-6">Genesis 11:1-6</span>), and the city of Babylon. The name occurs later in Jewish history (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_11">Isaiah 11:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC5_11">Zechariah 5:11</span>). Shinar was apparently first peopled by Turanian tribes, who tilled the land and made bricks and built cities. Then tribes of Semites invaded the land and settled in it, and became its rulers. This was followed in course of time by an Elamite invasion; from which the land was finally delivered by Khammurabi, the son of Amarpel (“Amraphel, king of Shinar,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_1">Genesis 14:1</span>), who became the founder of the new empire of Chaldea. (See AMRAPHEL.)
