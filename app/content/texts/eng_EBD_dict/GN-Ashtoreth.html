These names often occur in the plural(Ashtaroth, Baalim), probably as indicating either different statues or different modifications of the deities. This deity is spoken of as Ashtoreth of the Zidonians. She was the Ishtar of the Accadians and the Astarte of the Greeks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR44_17">Jeremiah 44:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_5,33">1 Kings 11:5, 33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13">2 Kings 23:13</span>). There was a temple of this goddess among the Philistines in the time of Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S131_10">1 Samuel 31:10</span>). Under the name of Ishtar, she was one of the great deities of the Assyrians. The Phoenicians called her Astarte. Solomon introduced the worship of this idol (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_33">1 Kings 11:33</span>). Jezebel’s 400 priests were probably employed in its service (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_19">1 Kings 18:19</span>). It was called the “queen of heaven” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR44_25">Jeremiah 44:25</span>).<br>
