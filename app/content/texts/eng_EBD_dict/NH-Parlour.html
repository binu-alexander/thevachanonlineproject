It corresponds to what the Turks call a kiosk, as in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_20">Judges 3:20</span> (the“summer parlour”), or as in the margin of the Revised Version (“the upper chamber of cooling”), a small room built on the roof of the house, with open windows to catch the breeze, and having a door communicating with the outside by which persons seeking an audience may be admitted. While Eglon was resting in such a parlour, Ehud, under pretence of having a message from God to him, was admitted into his presence, and murderously plunged his dagger into his body (21, 22).<br>The “inner parlours” in 1 Chronicles 28:11 were the small rooms or chambers which Solomon built all round two sides and one end of the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_5">1 Kings 6:5</span>), “side chambers;” or they may have been, as some think, the porch and the holy place.<br>In 1 Samuel 9:22 the Revised Version reads “guest chamber,” a chamber at the high place specially used for sacrificial feasts.<br>
