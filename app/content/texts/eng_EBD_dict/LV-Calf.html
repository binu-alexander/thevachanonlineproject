The “fatted calf” was regarded as the choicest of animal food; it was frequently also offered as a special sacrifice(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_24">1 Samuel 28:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_4">Amos 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_23">Luke 15:23</span>). The words used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR34_18,19">Jeremiah 34:18, 19</span>, “cut the calf in twain,” allude to the custom of dividing a sacrifice into two parts, between which the parties ratifying a covenant passed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_9,10,17,18">Genesis 15:9, 10, 17, 18</span>). The sacrifice of the lips, i.e., priase, is called “the calves of our lips” (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_2">14:2</span>, R.V., “as bullocks the offering of our lips.” Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_15">Hebrews 13:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS116_7">Psalm 116:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_11">Jeremiah 33:11</span>).<br>The golden calf which Aaron made (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_4">Exodus 32:4</span>) was probably a copy of the God Moloch rather than of the God Apis, the sacred ox or calf of Egypt. The Jews showed all through their history a tendency toward the Babylonian and Canaanitish idolatry rather than toward that of Egypt.<br>Ages after this, Jeroboam, king of Israel, set up two idol calves, one at Dan, and the other at Bethel, that he might thus prevent the ten tribes from resorting to Jerusalem for worship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_28">1 Kings 12:28</span>). These calves continued to be a snare to the people till the time of their captivity. The calf at Dan was carried away in the reign of Pekah by Tiglath-pileser, and that at Bethel ten years later, in the reign of Hoshea, by Shalmaneser (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_29">2 Kings 15:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_33">17:33</span>). This sin of Jeroboam is almost always mentioned along with his name (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_28">2 Kings 15:28</span> etc.).<br>
