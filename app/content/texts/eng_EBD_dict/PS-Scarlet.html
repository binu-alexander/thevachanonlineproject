It was one of the colours of the ephod (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_6">Exodus 28:6</span>), the girdle (8), and the breastplate (15) of the high priest. It is also mentioned in various other connections (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS2_18">Joshua 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_24">2 Samuel 1:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM4_5">Lamentations 4:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NM2_3">Nahum 2:3</span>). A scarlet robe was in mockery placed on our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_28">Matthew 27:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_11">Luke 23:11</span>). “Sins as scarlet” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18">Isaiah 1:18</span>), i.e., as scarlet robes “glaring and habitual.” Scarlet and crimson were the firmest of dyes, and thus not easily washed out.<br>
