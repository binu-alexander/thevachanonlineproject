It is identified with the village called Nein, standing on the north-western slope of Jebel ed-Duhy (=the “hill Moreh” = “Little hermon”), about 4 miles from Tabor and 25 southwest of Capernaum. At the foot of the slope on which it stands is the great plain of Esdraelon.<br>This was the first miracle of raising the dead our Lord had wrought, and it excited great awe and astonishment among the people.<br>
