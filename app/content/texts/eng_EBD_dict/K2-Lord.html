</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Lord" ><div class="is"><b>LORD</b></div><br>"LORD" There are various Hebrew and Greek words so rendered.<br>(1.) Hebrews Jehovah, has been rendered in the English Bible LORD, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of the God of the Hebrews. The form “Jehovah” is retained only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_3">Exodus 6:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS83_18">Psalm 83:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS12_2">Isaiah 12:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS26_4">26:4</span>, both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘adon, means one possessed of absolute control. It denotes a master, as of slaves (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_14,27">Genesis 24:14, 27</span>), or a ruler of his subjects (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_8">45:8</span>), or a husband, as Lord of his wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_12">18:12</span>).<br>The old plural form of this Hebrew word is ’adonai. From a superstitious reverence for the name “Jehovah,” the Jews, in reading their Scriptures, whenever that name occurred, always pronounced it ’Adonai.<br>(3.) Greek kurios, a supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this is invariably used for “Jehovah” and “‘Adonai.”(4.) Hebrews ba’al, a master, as having domination. This word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to persons skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen deities. “The men of Shechem,” literally “the baals of Shechem” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_2,3">Judges 9:2, 3</span>). These were the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to a condition of vassalage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS16_10">Joshua 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_13">17:13</span>).<br>(5.) Hebrews seren, applied exclusively to the “lords of the Philistines”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_3">Judges 3:3</span>). The LXX. render it by satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as at a later period (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10">1 Samuel 21:10</span>), under a kingly government. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_3">Joshua 13:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_18">1 Samuel 6:18</span>.) There were five such lordships, viz., Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.<br>

There is every reason to conclude that John thus used the name. (See SABBATH.)

</html><br><div class="is"><b>LORD</b></div><br>"LORD"’S PRAYER the name given to the only form of prayer Christ taught his disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_9-13">Matthew 6:9-13</span>). The closing doxology of the prayer is omitted by Luke (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_2-4">11:2-4</span>), also in the R.V. of <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_13">Matthew 6:13</span>. This prayer contains no allusion to the atonement of Christ, nor to the offices of the Holy Spirit. “All Christian prayer is based on the Lord’s Prayer, but its spirit is also guided by that of His prayer in Gethsemane and of the prayer recorded <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN17_">John 17</span>. The Lord’s Prayer is the comprehensive type of the simplest and most universal prayer.”

</html><br><div class="is"><b>LORD</b></div><br>"LORD"’S SUPPER (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C111_20">1 Corinthians 11:20</span>), called also “the Lord’s table”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_21">10:21</span>), “communion,” “cup of blessing” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_16">10:16</span>), and “breaking of bread”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_42">Acts 2:42</span>).<br>In the early Church it was called also “eucharist,” or giving of thanks(comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_27">Matthew 26:27</span>), and generally by the Latin Church “mass,” a name derived from the formula of dismission, Ite, missa est, i.e., “Go, it is discharged.” The account of the institution of this ordinance is given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_26-29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_26-29">Matthew 26:26-29</span></span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_22-25">Mark 14:22-25</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_19,20">Luke 22:19, 20</span>, and 1 Corinthians 11:24-26. It is not mentioned by John.<br>It was designed, (1.) To commemorate the death of Christ: “This do in remembrance of me.” (2.) To signify, seal, and apply to believers all the benefits of the new covenant. In this ordinance Christ ratifies his promises to his people, and they on their part solemnly consecrate themselves to him and to his entire service. (3.) To be a badge of the Christian profession. (4.) To indicate and to promote the communion of believers with Christ. (5.) To represent the mutual communion of believers with each other.<br>The elements used to represent Christ’s body and blood are bread and wine. The kind of bread, whether leavened or unleavened, is not specified.<br>Christ used unleavened bread simply because it was at that moment on the paschal table. Wine, and no other liquid, is to be used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_26-29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_26-29">Matthew 26:26-29</span></span>).<br>Believers “feed” on Christ’s body and blood, (1) not with the mouth in any manner, but (2) by the soul alone, and (3) by faith, which is the mouth or hand of the soul. This they do (4) by the power of the Holy Ghost.<br>This “feeding” on Christ, however, takes place not in the Lord’s Supper alone, but whenever faith in him is exercised.<br>This is a permanent ordinance in the Church of Christ, and is to be observed “till he come” again.<br>
