To express the idea that the Egyptians considered themselves as defiled when they ate with strangers(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_32">Genesis 43:32</span>). The Jews subsequently followed the same practice, holding it unlawful to eat or drink with foreigners (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_28">John 18:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_28">Acts 10:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_3">11:3</span>).<br>(2.) Every shepherd was “an abomination” unto the Egyptians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_34">Genesis 46:34</span>). This aversion to shepherds, such as the Hebrews, arose probably from the fact that Lower and Middle Egypt had formerly been held in oppressive subjection by a tribe of nomad shepherds (the Hyksos), who had only recently been expelled, and partly also perhaps from this other fact that the Egyptians detested the lawless habits of these wandering shepherds.<br>(3.) Pharaoh was so moved by the fourth plague, that while he refused the demand of Moses, he offered a compromise, granting to the Israelites permission to hold their festival and offer their sacrifices in Egypt. This permission could not be accepted, because Moses said they would have to sacrifice “the abomination of the Egyptians” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_26">Exodus 8:26</span>); i.e., the cow or ox, which all the Egyptians held as sacred, and which they regarded it as sacrilegious to kill.<br>(4.) Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX11_31">11:31</span>), in that section of his prophecies which is generally interpreted as referring to the fearful calamities that were to fall on the Jews in the time of Antiochus Epiphanes, says, “And they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.” Antiochus Epiphanes caused an altar to be erected on the altar of burnt-offering, on which sacrifices were offered to Jupiter Olympus. (Comp. 1 Macc. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX1_57">1:57</span>). This was the abomination of the desolation of Jerusalem. The same language is employed in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN9_27">Daniel 9:27</span> (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_15">Matthew 24:15</span>), where the reference is probably to the image-crowned standards which the Romans set up at the east gate of the temple (A.D. 70), and to which they paid idolatrous honours. “Almost the entire religion of the Roman camp consisted in worshipping the ensign, swearing by the ensign, and in preferring the ensign before all other gods.” These ensigns were an “abomination” to the Jews, the “abomination of desolation.” This word is also used symbolically of sin in general (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS66_3">Isaiah 66:3</span>); an idol(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_19">44:19</span>); the ceremonies of the apostate Church of Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4">Revelation 17:4</span>); a detestable act (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK22_11">Ezekiel 22:11</span>).<br>
