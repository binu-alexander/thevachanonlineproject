On re-opening it, Isaac gave it the same name (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_31-33">Genesis 26:31-33</span>). It was a favourite place of abode of both of these patriarchs(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_33-22">21:33-22</span>:1, 19; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_33">26:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_10">28:10</span>). It is mentioned among the “cities” given to the tribe of Simeon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_2">Joshua 19:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_28">1 Chronicles 4:28</span>). From Dan to Beersheba, a distance of about 144 miles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_1">Judges 20:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_2">1 Chronicles 21:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_2">2 Samuel 24:2</span>), became the usual way of designating the whole Promised Land, and passed into a proverb. After the return from the Captivity the phrase is narrowed into “from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_30">Nehemiah 11:30</span>). The kingdom of the ten tribes extended from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R219_4">2 Chronicles 19:4</span>). The name is not found in the New Testament. It is still called by the Arabs Bir es-Seba, i.e., “well of the seven”, where there are to the present day two principal wells and five smaller ones. It is nearly midway between the southern end of the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean.<br>
