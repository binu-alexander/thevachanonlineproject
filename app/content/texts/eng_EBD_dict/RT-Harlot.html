Hebrews zonah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_31">Genesis 34:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_15">38:15</span>). In verses 21, 22 the Hebrew word used in kedeshah, i.e., a woman consecrated or devoted to prostitution in connection with the abominable worship of Asherah or Astarte, the Syrian Venus. This word is also used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_17">Deuteronomy 23:17</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_14">4:14</span>. Thus Tamar sat by the wayside as a consecrated kedeshah.<br>It has been attempted to show that Rahab, usually called a “harlot”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS2_1">Joshua 2:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_17">6:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_31"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_31">Hebrews 11:31</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_25">James 2:25</span></span>), was only an innkeeper.<br>This interpretation, however, cannot be maintained.<br>Jephthah’s mother is called a “strange woman” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_2">Judges 11:2</span>). This, however, merely denotes that she was of foreign extraction.<br>In the time of Solomon harlots appeared openly in the streets, and he solemnly warns against association with them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_12">Proverbs 7:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR9_14">9:14</span>. See also <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR3_2">Jeremiah 3:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_24,25,31">Ezekiel 16:24, 25, 31</span>). The Revised Version, following the LXX., has “and the harlots washed,” etc., instead of the rendering of the Authorized Version, “now they washed,” of 1 Kings 22:38.<br>To commit fornication is metaphorically used for to practice idolatry(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR3_1">Jeremiah 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_15">Ezekiel 16:15</span>; Hos. throughout); hence Jerusalem is spoken of as a harlot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_21">Isaiah 1:21</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews nokriyah, the “strange woman” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_1">1 Kings 11:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR5_20">Proverbs 5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_5">7:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_27">23:27</span>). Those so designated were Canaanites and other Gentiles(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS23_13">Joshua 23:13</span>). To the same class belonged the “foolish”, i.e., the sinful,“woman.” In the New Testament the Greek pornai, plural, “harlots,” occurs in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_31,32">Matthew 21:31,32</span>, where they are classed with publicans; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_30">Luke 15:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_15,16">1 Corinthians 6:15,16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_31"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_31">Hebrews 11:31</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_25">James 2:25</span></span>. It is used symbolically in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_1,5,15,16">Revelation 17:1, 5, 15, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV19_2">19:2</span>.<br>
