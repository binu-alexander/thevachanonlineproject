Here Nebuchadnezzar had his head-quarters in his campaign against Jerusalem, and here also Necho fixed his camp after he had routed Josiah’s army at Megiddo (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_29-35">2 Kings 23:29-35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_6,20,21">25:6, 20, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_5">Jeremiah 39:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_10">52:10</span>). It was on the great caravan road from Palestine to Carchemish, on the Euphrates. It is described (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU34_11">Numbers 34:11</span>) as “on the eastern side of Ain.” A place still called el Ain, i.e., “the fountain”, is found in such a position about 10 miles distant. (See JERUSALEM.)
