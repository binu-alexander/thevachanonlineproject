He seems to have reigned but two years (B.C. 562-560). Influenced probably by Daniel, he showed kindness to Jehoiachin, who had been a prisoner in Babylon for thirty-seven years. He released him, and “spoke kindly to him.” He was murdered by Nergal-sharezer=Neriglissar, his brother-in-law, who succeeded him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_3,13">Jeremiah 39:3, 13</span>).<br>
