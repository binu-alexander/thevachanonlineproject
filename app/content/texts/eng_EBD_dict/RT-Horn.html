The horns of the altar of burnt offerings were to be smeared with the blood of the slain bullock (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_12">29:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_7-18">Leviticus 4:7-18</span>). The criminal, when his crime was accidental, found an asylum by laying hold of the horns of the altar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_50">1 Kings 1:50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_28">2:28</span>).<br>The word also denotes the peak or summit of a hill (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_1">Isaiah 5:1</span>, where the word “hill” is the rendering of the same Hebrew word).<br>This word is used metaphorically also for strength (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_17">Deuteronomy 33:17</span>) and honour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB16_15">Job 16:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM2_3">Lamentations 2:3</span>). Horns are emblems of power, dominion, glory, and fierceness, as they are the chief means of attack and defence with the animals endowed with them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_5,9">Daniel 8:5, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_1">1 Samuel 2:1</span>; 16:1, 13; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_39"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_39">1 Kings 1:39</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_11">22:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_4,5">Joshua 6:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_5,10">Psalm 75:5, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_17">132:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_69"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_69">Luke 1:69</span></span>, etc.). The expression “horn of salvation,” applied to Christ, means a salvation of strength, or a strong Saviour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_69"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_69">Luke 1:69</span></span>). To have the horn“exalted” denotes prosperity and triumph (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_17,24">Psalm 89:17, 24</span>). To “lift up” the horn is to act proudly (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_21">Zechariah 1:21</span>).<br>Horns are also the symbol of royal dignity and power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_25">Jeremiah 48:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_18">Zechariah 1:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_24">Daniel 8:24</span>).<br>
