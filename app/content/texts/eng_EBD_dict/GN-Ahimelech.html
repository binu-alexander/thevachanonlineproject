He descended from Eli in the line of Ithamar. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_16">1 Chronicles 18:16</span> he is called Abimelech, and is probably the same as Ahiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_3,18">1 Samuel 14:3, 18</span>). He was the twelfth high priest, and officiated at Nob, where he was visited by David (to whom and his companions he gave five loaves of the showbread) when he fled from Saul(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_1-9">1 Samuel 21:1-9</span>). He was summoned into Saulâ€™s presence, and accused, on the information of Doeg the Edomite, of disloyalty because of his kindness to David; whereupon the king commanded that he, with the other priests who stood beside him (86 in all), should be put to death. This sentence was carried into execution by Doeg in the most cruel manner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_9-23">1 Samuel 22:9-23</span>). Possibly Abiathar had a son also called Ahimelech, or the two names, as some think, may have been accidentally transposed in 2 Samuel 8:17; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_16">1 Chronicles 18:16</span>, marg.; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_3,6,31">24:3, 6, 31</span>.<br>
