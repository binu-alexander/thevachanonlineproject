The burning of the body was affixed by the law of Moses as a penalty to certain crimes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_14">Leviticus 20:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV21_9">21:9</span>).<br>To leave the dead unburied was regarded with horror (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K113_22">1 Kings 13:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_11">14:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_4">16:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_24">21:24</span>, etc.).<br>In the earliest times of which we have record kinsmen carried their dead to the grave (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_9">Genesis 25:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_29">35:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_31">Judges 16:31</span>), but in later times this was done by others (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_16">Amos 6:16</span>).<br>Immediately after decease the body was washed, and then wrapped in a large cloth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_37">Acts 9:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_59">Matthew 27:59</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_46">Mark 15:46</span>). In the case of persons of distinction, aromatics were laid on the folds of the cloth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_39">John 19:39</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_7">John 12:7</span>).<br>As a rule the burial (q.v.) took place on the very day of the death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC5_6,10">Acts 5:6, 10</span>), and the body was removed to the grave in an open coffin or on a bier (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_14">Luke 7:14</span>). After the burial a funeral meal was usually given (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_35">2 Samuel 3:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR16_5,7">Jeremiah 16:5, 7</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR9_4">9:4</span>).<br>
