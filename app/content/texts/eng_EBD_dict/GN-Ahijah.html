One of the sons of Bela(<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_7">1 Chronicles 8:7</span>, R.V.). In A.V. called “Ahiah.”(2.) One of the five sons of Jerahmeel, who was great-grandson of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_25">1 Chronicles 2:25</span>).<br>(3.) Son of Ahitub (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_3,18">1 Samuel 14:3, 18</span>), Ichabod’s brother; the same probably as Ahimelech, who was high priest at Nob in the reign of Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_11">1 Samuel 22:11</span>). Some, however, suppose that Ahimelech was the brother of Ahijah, and that they both officiated as high priests, Ahijah at Gibeah or Kirjath-jearim, and Ahimelech at Nob.<br>(4.) A Pelonite, one of David’s heroes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R111_36">1 Chronicles 11:36</span>); called also Eliam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_34">2 Samuel 23:34</span>).<br>(5.) A Levite having charge of the sacred treasury in the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R126_20">1 Chronicles 26:20</span>).<br>(6.) One of Solomon’s secretaries (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_3">1 Kings 4:3</span>).<br>(7.) A prophet of Shiloh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_29">1 Kings 11:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_2">14:2</span>), called the “Shilonite,” in the days of Rehoboam. We have on record two of his remarkable prophecies, <span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_31-39">1 Kings 11:31-39</span>, announcing the rending of the ten tribes from Solomon; and 1 Kings 14:6-16, delivered to Jeroboam’s wife, foretelling the death of Abijah the king’s son, the destruction of Jeroboam’s house, and the captivity of Israel “beyond the river.” Jeroboam bears testimony to the high esteem in which he was held as a prophet of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_2,3">1 Kings 14:2,3</span>).<br>
