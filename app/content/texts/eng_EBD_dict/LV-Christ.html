It denotes that he was anointed or consecrated to his great redemptive work as Prophet, Priest, and King of his people. He is Jesus the Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_3">Acts 17:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_5">18:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_42">Matthew 22:42</span>), the Anointed One. He is thus spoken of by Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT61_1">61:1</span>), and by Daniel(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_24-26">9:24-26</span>), who styles him “Messiah the Prince.” The Messiah is the same person as “the seed of the woman” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_15">Genesis 3:15</span>), “the seed of Abraham” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_18">Genesis 22:18</span>), the “Prophet like unto Moses” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT18_15">Deuteronomy 18:15</span>), “the priest after the order of Melchizedek”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS110_4">Psalm 110:4</span>), “the rod out of the stem of Jesse” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_1,10">Isaiah 11:1, 10</span>), the“Immanuel,” the virgin’s son (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_14">Isaiah 7:14</span>), “the branch of Jehovah” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS4_2">Isaiah 4:2</span>), and “the messenger of the covenant” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ML3_1">Malachi 3:1</span>). This is he “of whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.” The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB5_4">Hebrews 5:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_2-4">Isaiah 11:2-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS49_6">49:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN5_37">John 5:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_22">Acts 2:22</span>).<br>To believe that “Jesus is the Christ” is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C112_3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J15_1">1 John 5:1</span>).<br>
