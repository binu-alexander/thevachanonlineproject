Here no water could be found for the people to drink, and in their impatience they were ready to stone Moses, as if he were the cause of their distress. At the command of God Moses smote “the rock in Horeb,” and a copious stream flowed forth, enough for all the people. After this the Amalekites attacked the Israelites while they were here encamped, but they were utterly defeated (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_1,8-16">Exodus 17:1, 8-16</span>). They were the “first of the nations” to make war against Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_20">Numbers 24:20</span>).<br>Leaving Rephidim, the Israelites advanced into the wilderness of Sinai(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_1,2">Exodus 19:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_14,15">Numbers 33:14, 15</span>), marching probably through the two passes of the Wady Solaf and the Wady esh-Sheikh, which converge at the entrance to the plain er-Rahah, the “desert of Sinai,” which is two miles long and about half a mile broad. (See SINAI; MERIBAH.)
