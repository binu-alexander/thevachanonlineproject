But that seems to have been only a temporary arrangement which Moses made. This council is with greater probability supposed to have originated among the Jews when they were under the domination of the Syrian kings in the time of the Maccabees.<br>The name is first employed by the Jewish historian Josephus. This“council” is referred to simply as the “chief priests and elders of the people” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_3,47,57,59"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_3">Matthew 26:3</span>, 47, 57, 59</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_1,3,12,20">27:1, 3, 12, 20</span>, etc.), before whom Christ was tried on the charge of claiming to be the Messiah. Peter and John were also brought before it for promulgating heresy (Acts. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_1-23">4:1-23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_17-41">5:17-41</span>); as was also Stephen on a charge of blasphemy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_12-15">6:12-15</span>), and Paul for violating a temple by-law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_30">22:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_1-10">23:1-10</span>).<br>The Sanhedrin is said to have consisted of seventy-one members, the high priest being president. They were of three classes (1) the chief priests, or heads of the twenty-four priestly courses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_">1 Chronicles 24</span>), (2) the scribes, and (3) the elders. As the highest court of judicature, “in all causes and over all persons, ecclesiastical and civil, supreme,” its decrees were binding, not only on the Jews in Palestine, but on all Jews wherever scattered abroad. Its jurisdiction was greatly curtailed by Herod, and afterwards by the Romans. Its usual place of meeting was within the precincts of the temple, in the hall “Gazith,” but it sometimes met also in the house of the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_3">Matthew 26:3</span>), who was assisted by two vice-presidents.<br>
