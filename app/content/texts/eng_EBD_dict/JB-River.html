Hebrews ‘aphik, properly the channel or ravine that holds water (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S222_16">2 Samuel 22:16</span>), translated “brook,” “river,” “stream,” but not necessarily a perennial stream (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK6_3">Ezekiel 6:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_12">31:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK32_6">32:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK34_13">34:13</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews nahal, in winter a “torrent,” in summer a “wady” or valley(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_23">Genesis 32:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_24">Deuteronomy 2:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_16">3:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_28">Isaiah 30:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM2_18">Lamentations 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK47_9">Ezekiel 47:9</span>).<br>These winter torrents sometimes come down with great suddenness and with desolating force. A distinguished traveller thus describes his experience in this matter:, “I was encamped in Wady Feiran, near the base of Jebel Serbal, when a tremendous thunderstorm burst upon us. After little more than an hour’s rain, the water rose so rapidly in the previously dry wady that I had to run for my life, and with great difficulty succeeded in saving my tent and goods; my boots, which I had not time to pick up, were washed away. In less than two hours a dry desert wady upwards of 300 yards broad was turned into a foaming torrent from 8 to 10 feet deep, roaring and tearing down and bearing everything upon it, tangled masses of tamarisks, hundreds of beautiful palmtrees, scores of sheep and goats, camels and donkeys, and even men, women, and children, for a whole encampment of Arabs was washed away a few miles above me. The storm commenced at five in the evening; at half-past nine the waters were rapidly subsiding, and it was evident that the flood had spent its force.” (Comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_27">Matthew 7:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_49">Luke 6:49</span>.)(3.) Nahar, a “river” continuous and full, a perennial stream, as the Jordan, the Euphrates (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_10">Genesis 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_18">15:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_7">Deuteronomy 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS66_6">Psalm 66:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK10_15">Ezekiel 10:15</span>).<br>(4.) Tel’alah, a conduit, or water-course (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_32">1 Kings 18:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_17">2 Kings 18:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K220_20">20:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_25">Job 38:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_4">Ezekiel 31:4</span>).<br>(5.) Peleg, properly “waters divided”, i.e., streams divided, throughout the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS1_3">Psalm 1:3</span>); “the rivers [i.e., ‘divisions’] of waters” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB20_17">Job 20:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB29_6">29:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR5_16">Proverbs 5:16</span>).<br>(6.) Ye’or, i.e., “great river”, probably from an Egyptian word (Aur), commonly applied to the Nile (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_1-3">Genesis 41:1-3</span>), but also to other rivers(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB28_10">Job 28:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS33_21">Isaiah 33:21</span>).<br>(7.) Yubhal, “a river” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR17_8">Jeremiah 17:8</span>), a full flowing stream.<br>(8.) ‘Ubhal, “a river” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_2">Daniel 8:2</span>).<br>
