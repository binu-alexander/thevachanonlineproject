The chief of these are, (1.) A Levite descended from Gershom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_30">Judges 18:30</span>). His history is recorded in 17:7-13 and 18:30. The Rabbins changed this name into Manasseh “to screen the memory of the great lawgiver from the stain of having so unworthy an apostate among his near descendants.” He became priest of the idol image at Dan, and this office continued in his family till the Captivity.<br>(2.) The eldest son of king Saul, and the bosom friend of David. He is first mentioned when he was about thirty years of age, some time after his father’s accession to the throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_2">1 Samuel 13:2</span>). Like his father, he was a man of great strength and activity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_23">2 Samuel 1:23</span>), and excelled in archery and slinging (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_2">1 Chronicles 12:2</span>;<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_22">2 Samuel 1:22</span>). The affection that evidently subsisted between him and his father was interrupted by the growth of Saul’s insanity. At length, “in fierce anger,” he left his father’s presence and cast in his lot with the cause of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S120_34">1 Samuel 20:34</span>).<br>After an eventful career, interwoven to a great extent with that of David, he fell, along with his father and his two brothers, on the fatal field of Gilboa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S131_2,8">1 Samuel 31:2, 8</span>). He was first buried at Jabesh-gilead, but his remains were afterwards removed with those of his father to Zelah, in Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_12-14">2 Samuel 21:12-14</span>). His death was the occasion of David’s famous elegy of “the Song of the Bow” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_17-27">2 Samuel 1:17-27</span>). He left one son five years old, Merib-baal, or Mephibosheth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S24_4">2 Samuel 4:4</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_34">1 Chronicles 8:34</span>).<br>(3.) Son of the high priest Abiathar, and one who adhered to David at the time of Absalom’s rebellion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_27,36">2 Samuel 15:27, 36</span>). He is the last descendant of Eli of whom there is any record.<br>(4.) Son of Shammah, and David’s nephew, and also one of his chief warriors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_21">2 Samuel 21:21</span>). He slew a giant in Gath.<br>
