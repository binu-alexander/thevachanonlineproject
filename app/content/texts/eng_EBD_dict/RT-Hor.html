One of the mountains of the chain of Seir or Edom, on the confines of Idumea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_22-29">Numbers 20:22-29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_37"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_37">33:37</span></span>). It was one of the stations of the Israelites in the wilderness (33:37), which they reached in the circuitous route they were obliged to take because the Edomites refused them a passage through their territory. It was during the encampment here that Aaron died (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_37-41">Numbers 33:37-41</span>). (See AARON.) The Israelites passed this mountain several times in their wanderings. It bears the modern name of Jebel Harun, and is the highest and most conspicious of the whole range. It stands about midway between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic gulf. It has two summits, in the hallow between which it is supposed that Aaron died. Others, however, suppose that this mountain is the modern Jebel Madurah, on the opposite, i.e., the western, side of the Arabah.<br>(2.) One of the marks of the northern boundary of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU34_7,8">Numbers 34:7, 8</span>). Nowhere else mentioned. Perhaps it is one of the peaks of Lebanon.<br>
