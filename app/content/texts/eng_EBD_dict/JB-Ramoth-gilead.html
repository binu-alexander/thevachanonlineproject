Here Ahab, who joined Jehoshaphat in an endeavour to rescue it from the hands of the king of Syria, was mortally wounded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_1-36">1 Kings 22:1-36</span>). A similar attempt was afterwards made by Ahaziah and Joram, when the latter was wounded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_28">2 Kings 8:28</span>). In this city Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, was anointed by one of the sons of the prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_1,4">9:1, 4</span>).<br>It has with probability been identified with Reimun, on the northern slope of the Jabbok, about 5 miles west of Jerash or Gerasa, one of the cities of Decapolis. Others identify it with Gerosh, about 25 miles north-east of es-Salt, with which also many have identified it. (See RAMATH-MIZPEH.)
