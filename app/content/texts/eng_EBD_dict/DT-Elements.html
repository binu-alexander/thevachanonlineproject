In this sense it is used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_3,9">Galatians 4:3, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_8,20">Colossians 2:8, 20</span>, where the expressions, “elements of the world,” “week and beggarly elements,” denote that state of religious knowledge existing among the Jews before the coming of Christ, the rudiments of religious teaching. They are “of the world,” because they are made up of types which appeal to the senses. They are “weak,” because insufficient; and “beggarly,” or “poor,” because they are dry and barren, not being accompanied by an outpouring of spiritual gifts and graces, as the gospel is.<br>
