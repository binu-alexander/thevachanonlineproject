The sister of David, and wife of Jether an Ishmaelite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_16,17">1 Chronicles 2:16,17</span>). She was the mother of Amasa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_25">2 Samuel 17:25</span>).<br>(2.) The wife of the churlish Nabal, who dwelt in the district of Carmel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_3">1 Samuel 25:3</span>). She showed great prudence and delicate management at a critical period of her husband’s life. She was “a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance.” After Nabal’s death she became the wife of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_14-42">1 Samuel 25:14-42</span>), and was his companion in all his future fortunes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_3">1 Samuel 27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_5">30:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_2">2 Samuel 2:2</span>). By her David had a son called Chileab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_3">2 Samuel 3:3</span>), elsewhere called Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_1">1 Chronicles 3:1</span>).<br>
