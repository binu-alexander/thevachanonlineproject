Here our Lord wrought his first miracle, the turning of water into wine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN2_1-11">John 2:1-11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_46">4:46</span>). It is also mentioned as the birth-place of Nathanael (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_2">21:2</span>). It is not mentioned in the Old Testament. It has been identified with the modern Kana el-Jelil, also called Khurbet Kana, a place 8 or 9 miles north of Nazareth. Others have identified it with Kefr Kenna, which lies on the direct road to the Sea of Galilee, about 5 miles north-east of Nazareth, and 12 in a direct course from Tiberias. It is called “Cana of Galilee,” to distinguish it from Cana of Asher (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_28">Joshua 19:28</span>).<br>
