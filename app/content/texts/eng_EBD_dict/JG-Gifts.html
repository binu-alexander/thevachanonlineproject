These were the result of the extraordinary operation of the Spirit, as on the day of Pentecost. They were the gifts of speaking with tongues, casting out devils, healing, etc.<br>(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_17,18">Mark 16:17, 18</span>), usually communicated by the medium of the laying on of the hands of the apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_17">Acts 8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_6">19:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T14_14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>). These charismata were enjoyed only for a time. They could not continue always in the Church. They were suited to its infancy and to the necessities of those times.<br>
