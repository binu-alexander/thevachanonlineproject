The most extensive was the trans-Jordanic forest of Ephraim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_6,8">2 Samuel 18:6, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_15,18">Joshua 17:15, 18</span>), which is probably the same as the wood of Ephratah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_6">Psalm 132:6</span>), some part of the great forest of Gilead. It was in this forest that Absalom was slain by Joab. David withdrew to the forest of Hareth in the mountains of Judah to avoid the fury of Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_5">1 Samuel 22:5</span>). We read also of the forest of Bethel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_23,24">2 Kings 2:23, 24</span>), and of that which the Israelites passed in their pursuit of the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_25">1 Samuel 14:25</span>), and of the forest of the cedars of Lebanon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_33">1 Kings 4:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_23">2 Kings 19:23</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_5,6">14:5, 6</span>).<br>“The house of the forest of Lebanon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_2">1 Kings 7:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_17">10:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_16">2 Chronicles 9:16</span>) was probably Solomon’s armoury, and was so called because the wood of its many pillars came from Lebanon, and they had the appearance of a forest. (See BAALBEC.) Hebrews horesh, denoting a thicket of trees, underwood, jungle, bushes, or trees entangled, and therefore affording a safe hiding-place. place. This word is rendered “forest” only in 2 Chronicles 27:4. It is also rendered“wood”, the “wood” in the “wilderness of Ziph,” in which david concealed himself (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_15">1 Samuel 23:15</span>), which lay south-east of Hebron. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS17_19">Isaiah 17:19</span> this word is in Authorized Version rendered incorrectly “bough.” Hebrews pardes, meaning an enclosed garden or plantation. Asaph is(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_8">Nehemiah 2:8</span>) called the “keeper of the king’s forest.” The same Hebrew word is used <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_5">Ecclesiastes 2:5</span>, where it is rendered in the plural “orchards”(R.V., “parks”), and Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC4_13">4: 13</span>, rendered “orchard” (R.V. marg., “a paradise”).<br>“The forest of the vintage” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC11_2">Zechariah 11:2</span>, “inaccessible forest,” or R.V.<br>“strong forest”) is probably a figurative allusion to Jerusalem, or the verse may simply point to the devastation of the region referred to.<br>The forest is an image of unfruitfulness as contrasted with a cultivated field (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS29_17">Isaiah 29:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS32_15">32:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR26_18">Jeremiah 26:18</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_12">2:12</span>). Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR10_19,33,34">10:19, 33, 34</span>) likens the Assyrian host under Sennacherib (q.v.) to the trees of some huge forest, to be suddenly cut down by an unseen stroke.<br>
