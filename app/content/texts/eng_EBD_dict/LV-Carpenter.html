The tools used by carpenters are mentioned in 1 Samuel 13:19, 20; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_21">Judges 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_15">Isaiah 10:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_13">44:13</span>. It was said of our Lord, “Is not this the carpenter’s son?” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_55">Matthew 13:55</span>); also, “Is not this the carpenter?” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_3">Mark 6:3</span></span>). Every Jew, even the rabbis, learned some handicraft: Paul was a tentmaker. “In the cities the carpenters would be Greeks, and skilled workmen; the carpenter of a provincial village could only have held a very humble position, and secured a very moderate competence.”
