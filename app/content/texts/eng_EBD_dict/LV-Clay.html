Our Lord’s tomb may have been thus sealed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_66">Matthew 27:66</span>). The practice of sealing doors with clay is still common in the East. Clay was also in primitive times used for mortar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_3">Genesis 11:3</span>). The “clay ground” in which the large vessels of the temple were cast (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_46">1 Kings 7:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_17">2 Chronicles 4:17</span>) was a compact loam fitted for the purpose. The expression literally rendered is,“in the thickness of the ground,”, meaning, “in stiff ground” or in clay.<br>
