Hebrew halabh, “new milk”, milk in its fresh state (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_19">Judges 4:19</span>). It is frequently mentioned in connection with honey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_8">Exodus 3:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_5">13:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_6">Joshua 5:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_15,22">Isaiah 7:15, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR11_5">Jeremiah 11:5</span>). Sheep (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14">Deuteronomy 32:14</span></span>) and goats (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR27_27">Proverbs 27:27</span>) and camels (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_15">Genesis 32:15</span>), as well as cows, are made to give their milk for the use of man. Milk is used figuratively as a sign of abundance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_12">Genesis 49:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_4">Ezekiel 25:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_18">Joel 3:18</span>).<br>It is also a symbol of the rudiments of doctrine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_2">1 Corinthians 3:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB5_12,13">Hebrews 5:12, 13</span>), and of the unadulterated word of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P12_2">1 Peter 2:2</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews hem’ah, always rendered “butter” in the Authorized Version.<br>It means “butter,” but also more frequently “cream,” or perhaps, as some think, “curdled milk,” such as that which Abraham set before the angels(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_8">Genesis 18:8</span>), and which Jael gave to Sisera (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_25">Judges 5:25</span>). In this state milk was used by travellers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_29">2 Samuel 17:29</span>). If kept long enough, it acquired a slightly intoxicating or soporific power.<br>This Hebrew word is also sometimes used for milk in general(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14">Deuteronomy 32:14</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB20_17">Job 20:17</span>).<br>
