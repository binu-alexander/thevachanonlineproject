An injury or wrong done to one (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_31">1 Samuel 25:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM5_15">Romans 5:15</span>).<br>(2.) A stumbling-block or cause of temptation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS8_14">Isaiah 8:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_23">Matthew 16:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_7">18:7</span>). Greek skandalon, properly that at which one stumbles or takes offence. The “offence of the cross” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_11">Galatians 5:11</span>) is the offence the Jews took at the teaching that salvation was by the crucified One, and by him alone. Salvation by the cross was a stumbling-block to their national pride.<br>
