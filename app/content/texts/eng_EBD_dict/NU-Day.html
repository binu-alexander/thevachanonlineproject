Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night into three watches, (1) from sunset to midnight(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LM2_19">Lamentations 2:19</span>); (2) from midnight till the cock-crowing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_19">Judges 7:19</span>); and (3) from the cock-crowing till sunrise (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_24">Exodus 14:24</span>). In the New Testament the division of the Greeks and Romans into four watches was adopted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK13_35">Mark 13:35</span>). (See WATCHES.) The division of the day by hours is first mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_6,15">Daniel 3:6, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN4_19">4:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN5_5">5:5</span>. This mode of reckoning was borrowed from the Chaldeans. The reckoning of twelve hours was from sunrise to sunset, and accordingly the hours were of variable length (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_9">John 11:9</span>).<br>The word “day” sometimes signifies an indefinite time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_4">Genesis 2:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_5">Isaiah 22:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB3_8">Hebrews 3:8</span>, etc.). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB3_1">Job 3:1</span> it denotes a birthday, and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_12">Isaiah 2:12</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_31">Acts 17:31</span>, and 2 Timothy 1:18, the great day of final judgment.<br>

The“three days’ journey” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_18">Exodus 3:18</span> is simply a journey which would occupy three days in going and returning.<br>
