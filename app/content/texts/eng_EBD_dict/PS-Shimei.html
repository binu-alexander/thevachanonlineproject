A son of Gershon, and grandson of Levi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_18">Numbers 3:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_17,29">1 Chronicles 6:17, 29</span>); called Shimi in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_17">Exodus 6:17</span>.<br>(2.) A Benjamite of the house of Saul, who stoned and cursed David when he reached Bahurim in his flight from Jerusalem on the occasion of the rebellion of Absalom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_5-13">2 Samuel 16:5-13</span>). After the defeat of Absalom he“came cringing to the king, humbly suing for pardon, bringing with him a thousand of his Benjamite tribesmen, and representing that he was heartily sorry for his crime, and had hurried the first of all the house of Israel to offer homage to the king” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_16-23">19:16-23</span>). David forgave him; but on his death-bed he gave Solomon special instructions regarding Shimei, of whose fidelity he seems to have been in doubt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_8,9">1 Kings 2:8,9</span>). He was put to death at the command of Solomon, because he had violated his word by leaving Jerusalem and going to Gath to recover two of his servants who had escaped (36-46).<br>(3.) One of David’s mighty men who refused to acknowledge Adonijah as David’s successor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_8">1 Kings 1:8</span>). He is probably the same person who is called elsewhere (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_18">4:18</span>) “the son of Elah.”(4.) A son of Pedaiah, the brother of Zerubbabel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_19">1 Chronicles 3:19</span>).<br>(5.) A Simeonite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_26,27">1 Chronicles 4:26, 27</span>).<br>(6.) A Reubenite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_4">1 Chronicles 5:4</span>).<br>(7.) A Levite of the family of Gershon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_42">1 Chronicles 6:42</span>).<br>(8.) A Ramathite who was “over the vineyards” of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_27">1 Chronicles 27:27</span>).<br>(9.) One of the sons of Heman, who assisted in the purification of the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_14">2 Chronicles 29:14</span>).<br>(10.) A Levite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_12,13">2 Chronicles 31:12, 13</span>).<br>(11.) Another Levite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER10_23">Ezra 10:23</span>). “The family of Shimei” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC12_13">Zechariah 12:13</span>; R.V., “the family of the Shimeites”) were the descendants of Shimei(1).<br>
