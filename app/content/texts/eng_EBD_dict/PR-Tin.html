It is the general opinion that the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon obtained their supplies of tin from the British Isles. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_12">Ezekiel 27:12</span> it is said to have been brought from Tarshish, which was probably a commercial emporium supplied with commodities from other places. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_25">Isaiah 1:25</span> the word so rendered is generally understood of lead, the alloy with which the silver had become mixed (ver. 22). The fire of the Babylonish Captivity would be the means of purging out the idolatrous alloy that had corrupted the people.<br>
