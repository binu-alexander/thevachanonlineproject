It is also called the “feast of ingathering”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_16">Exodus 23:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_13">Deuteronomy 16:13</span>). It was celebrated immediately after the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted for eight days(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_33-43"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_33-43">Leviticus 23:33-43</span></span>). During that period the people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU29_13-38">Numbers 29:13-38</span>. It was at the time of this feast that Solomon’s temple was dedicated (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_2">1 Kings 8:2</span>). Mention is made of it after the return from the Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_43">Leviticus 23:43</span>), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_9-18">Nehemiah 8:9-18</span>).<br>The Jews, at a later time, introduced two appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon the altar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_2,37">John 7:2, 37</span>), as a memorial of the water from the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night, a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their wanderings.<br>“The feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th(of the month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the pilgrimage through the wilderness. The ingathering of fruits prophesied of the spiritual harvest.”, Valling’s Jesus Christ, p. 133.<br>
