</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Naked" ><div class="is"><b>NAKED</b></div><br>"NAKED" This word denotes (1) absolute nakedness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_25">Genesis 2:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_21">Job 1:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC5_15">Ecclesiastes 5:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC1_8">Micah 1:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM2_16">Amos 2:16</span>); (2) being poorly clad(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS58_7">Isaiah 58:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_15">James 2:15</span>). It denotes also (3) the state of one who has laid aside his loose outer garment (Lat. nudus), and appears clothed only in a long tunic or under robe worn next the skin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_24">1 Samuel 19:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS47_3">Isaiah 47:3</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_52">Mark 14:52</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7">John 21:7</span>). It is used figuratively, meaning “being discovered” or “made manifest” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB26_6">Job 26:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB4_13">Hebrews 4:13</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_25">Exodus 32:25</span> the expression “the people were naked” (A.V.) is more correctly rendered in the Revised Version “the people were broken loose”, i.e., had fallen into a state of lawlessness and insubordination. In 2 Chronicles 28:19 the words “he made Judah naked” (A.V.), but Revised Version “he had dealt wantonly in Judah,” mean “he had permitted Judah to break loose from all the restraints of religion.”
