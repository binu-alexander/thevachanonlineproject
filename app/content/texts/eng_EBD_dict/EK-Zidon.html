It received its name from the “first-born” of Canaan, the grandson of Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_15,19">Genesis 10:15, 19</span>). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a “great” city (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_8">Joshua 11:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_28">19:28</span>). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_31">Judges 1:31</span>). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG10_12">Judges 10:12</span>). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its “virgin daughter”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS23_12">Isaiah 23:12</span>), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_1,33">1 Kings 11:1, 33</span>). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_6">1 Kings 5:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_4">1 Chronicles 22:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_8">Ezekiel 27:8</span></span>). It is frequently referred to by the prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS23_2,4,12">Isaiah 23:2, 4, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_22">Jeremiah 25:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR27_3">27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR47_4">47:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_8">Ezekiel 27:8</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK28_21,22">28:21, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK32_30">32:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_4">Joel 3:4</span>). Our Lord visited the “coasts” of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_21">Matthew 15:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_24">Mark 7:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK4_26">Luke 4:26</span>; and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_8">Mark 3:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_17">Luke 6:17</span>).<br>From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_3,4">Acts 27:3, 4</span>).<br>This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a “king of the Sidonians,” probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, “the goddess of the Sidonians.” In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief God of the Sidonians.<br>
