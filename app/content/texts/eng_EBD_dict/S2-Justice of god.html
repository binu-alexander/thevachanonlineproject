At first God imposes righteous laws on his creatures and executes them righteously. Justice is not an optional product of his will, but an unchangeable principle of his very nature. His legislative justice is his requiring of his rational creatures conformity in all respects to the moral law. His rectoral or distributive justice is his dealing with his accountable creatures according to the requirements of the law in rewarding or punishing them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_14">Psalm 89:14</span>). In remunerative justice he distributes rewards (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_12">James 1:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_8">2 Timothy 4:8</span>); in vindictive or punitive justice he inflicts punishment on account of transgression (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H21_6">2 Thessalonians 1:6</span>). He cannot, as being infinitely righteous, do otherwise than regard and hate sin as intrinsically hateful and deserving of punishment. “He cannot deny himself” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T22_13">2 Timothy 2:13</span>). His essential and eternal righteousness immutably determines him to visit every sin as such with merited punishment.<br>
