Such like enclosures abound in the wilderness of Paran, which the Israelites entered after leaving Sinai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_35">Numbers 11:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_16">12:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_17,18">33:17, 18</span>). This third encampment of the Israelites has been identified with the modern ‘Ain el-Hudhera, some 40 miles north-east of Sinai. Here Miriam (q.v.), being displeased that Moses had married a Cushite wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_1">Numbers 12:1</span>), induced Aaron to join with her in rebelling against Moses. God vindicated the authority of his “servant Moses,” and Miriam was smitten with leprosy. Moses interceded for her, and she was healed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_4-16">Numbers 12:4-16</span>). From this encampment the Israelites marched northward across the plateau of et-Tih, and at length reached KADESH.<br>
