Hebrews hedek (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR15_19">Proverbs 15:19</span>), rendered “brier” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC7_4">Micah 7:4</span>. Some thorny plant, of the Solanum family, suitable for hedges. This is probably the so-called “apple of Sodom,” which grows very abundantly in the Jordan valley. “It is a shrubby plant, from 3 to 5 feet high, with very branching stems, thickly clad with spines, like those of the English brier, with leaves very large and woolly on the under side, and thorny on the midriff.”(2.) Hebrews kotz (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_18">Genesis 3:18</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_8">10:8</span>), rendered akantha by the LXX. In the New Testament this word akantha is also rendered “thorns”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_16">Matthew 7:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_7">13:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB6_8">Hebrews 6:8</span>). The word seems to denote any thorny or prickly plant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR12_13">Jeremiah 12:13</span>). It has been identified with the Ononis spinosa by some.<br>(3.) Hebrews na’atzutz (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_19">Isaiah 7:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS55_13">55:13</span>). This word has been interpreted as denoting the Zizyphus spina Christi, or the jujube-tree. It is supposed by some that the crown of thorns placed in wanton cruelty by the Roman soldiers on our Saviour’s brow before his crucifixion was plaited of branches of this tree. It overruns a great part of the Jordan valley. It is sometimes called the lotus-tree. “The thorns are long and sharp and recurved, and often create a festering wound.” It often grows to a great size. (See CROWN OF THORNS.)(4.) Hebrews atad (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS58_9">Psalm 58:9</span>) is rendered in the LXX. and Vulgate by Rhamnus, or Lycium Europoeum, a thorny shrub, which is common all over Palestine. From its resemblance to the box it is frequently called the box-thorn.<br>
