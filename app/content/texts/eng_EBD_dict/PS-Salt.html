All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_13">Leviticus 2:13</span>). To eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was bound to look after his host’s interests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER4_14">Ezra 4:14</span>, “We have maintenance from the king’s palace;” A.V. marg., “We are salted with the salt of the palace;” R.V., “We eat the salt of the palace”).<br>A “covenant of salt” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_19">Numbers 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R213_5">2 Chronicles 13:5</span>) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_4">Ezekiel 16:4</span>). Disciples are likened unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13">Matthew 5:13</span></span>). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem, he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_45">Judges 9:45</span>). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on scientific grounds, that under the generic name of “salt,” in certain passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_26">Genesis 19:26</span> he would read “pillar of asphalt;” and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13">Matthew 5:13</span></span>, instead of “salt,”“petroleum,” which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made.<br>The Jebel Usdum, to the south of the Dead Sea, is a mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and from 2 to 3 miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.<br>

This valley (the’ Arabah) is between Judah and Edom on the south of the Dead Sea. Hence some interpreters would insert the words,“and he smote Edom,” after the words, “Syrians” in the above text. It is conjectured that while David was leading his army against the Ammonites and Syrians, the Edomites invaded the south of Judah, and that David sent Joab or Abishai against them, who drove them back and finally subdued Edom. (Comp. title to <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS60_">Psalm 60</span>.) Here also Amaziah “slew of Edom ten thousand men” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_7">2 Kings 14:7</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_20-22">8: 20-22</span> and 2 Chronicles 25:5-11).<br>
