A country in western Asia lying between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Here the ark of Noah rested after the Deluge (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_4">Genesis 8:4</span>). It is for the most part high table-land, and is watered by the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and the Tigris. Ararat was properly the name of a part of ancient Armenia. Three provinces of Armenia are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_27">Jeremiah 51:27</span>, Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz. Some, however, think Minni a contraction for Armenia. (See ARARAT.)
