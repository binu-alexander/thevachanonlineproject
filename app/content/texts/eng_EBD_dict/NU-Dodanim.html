They are known in profane history as the Dardani, originally inhabiting Illyricum. They were a semi-Pelasgic race, and in the ethnographical table(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_">Genesis 10</span>) they are grouped with the Chittim (q.v.). In 1 Chronicles 1:7, they are called Rodanim. The LXX. and the Samaritan Version also read Rhodii, whence some have concluded that the Rhodians, the inhabitants of the island of Rhodes, are meant.<br>
