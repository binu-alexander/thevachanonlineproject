The town seems to have given its name to a district, as appears from 1 Kings 15:20, where the plural form of the word is used.<br>The Sea of Chinnereth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU34_11">Numbers 34:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_27">Joshua 13:27</span>), or of Chinneroth(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_3">Joshua 12: 3</span>), was the “lake of Gennesaret” or “sea of Tiberias”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_17">Deuteronomy 3:17</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_2">Joshua 11:2</span>). Chinnereth was probably an ancient Canaanitish name adopted by the Israelites into their language.<br>
