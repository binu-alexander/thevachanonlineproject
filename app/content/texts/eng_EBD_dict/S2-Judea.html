But under the Romans, in the time of Christ, it denoted the southernmost of the three divisions of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_1,5">Matthew 2:1, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_1">3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_25">4:25</span>), although it was also sometimes used for Palestine generally (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_21">Acts 28:21</span>).<br>The province of Judea, as distinguished from Galilee and Samaria, included the territories of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, Dan, Simeon, and part of Ephraim. Under the Romans it was a part of the province of Syria, and was governed by a procurator.<br>
