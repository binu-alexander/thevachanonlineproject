One who, with Annas and Caiaphas, sat in judgment on the apostles Peter and John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_6">Acts 4:6</span>). He was of the kindred of the high priest; otherwise unknown.<br>(2.) The Hebrew name of Mark (q.v.). He is designated by this name in the acts of the Apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_12,25">12:12, 25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_5,13">13:5, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_37">15:37</span>).<br>(3.) THE APOSTLE, brother of James the “Greater” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_2">10:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_19">Mark 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_17">3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_35">10:35</span>). He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span></span>) and Salome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_56">Matthew 27:56</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_40">Mark 15:40</span>), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_20">Mark 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_3">Luke 5:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_27">John 19:27</span>). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth.<br>When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, “Behold the Lamb of God,” and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_36,37">John 1:36, 37</span>) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain.<br>Jesus again called them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4: 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples.<br>He became one of the innermost circle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_37">Mark 5:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_37">26:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK13_3">Mark 13:3</span>). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a “Boanerges” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_17">Mark 3:17</span>). This spirit once and again broke out (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20-24">Matthew <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_2">20:2</span>0-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_35-41">Mark 10:35-41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_49,54">Luke 9:49, 54</span>). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_15">John 18:15</span>). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_16,19,28">18:16, 19, 28</span>) and to the place of crucifixion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_26,27">19:26, 27</span>). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_1,7">21:1, 7</span>). We find Peter and John frequently after this together (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC3_1">Acts 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_13">4:13</span>). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_6">Acts 15:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_9">Galatians 2:9</span>). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul’s last visit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_15-40">Acts 21:15-40</span>). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_11">Revelation 1:11</span>). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_9">1:9</span>); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>JOHN</b></div><br>"JOHN", FIRST EPISTLE OF the fourth of the catholic or “general” epistles. It was evidently written by John the evangelist, and probably also at Ephesus, and when the writer was in advanced age. The purpose of the apostle (1:1-4) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with God are, (1) on the part of Christ, his atoning work (1:7; 2:2; 3:5; 4:10, 14; 5:11, 12) and his advocacy (2:1); and (2), on the part of man, holiness (1:6), obedience (2:3), purity (3:3), faith (3:23; 4:3; 5:5), and love (2:7, 8; 3:14; 4:7; 5:1).<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>JOHN</b></div><br>"JOHN", GOSPEL OF The genuineness of this Gospel, i.e., the fact that the apostle John was its author, is beyond all reasonable doubt. In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success.<br>The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_31">John 20:31</span>). It was at one time supposed that he wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this. “There is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves to him as the Light of life” (Reuss).<br>After the prologue (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_1-5">1:1-5</span>), the historical part of the book begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first part (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_6-">1:6-</span>ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord’s public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21) presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).<br>The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2) of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to love as an element in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to Christians.<br>It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of Christian life and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.<br>

</html><br><div class="is"><b>JOHN</b></div><br>"JOHN", SECOND EPISTLE OF is addressed to “the elect lady,” and closes with the words, “The children of thy elect sister greet thee;” but some would read instead of “lady” the proper name Kyria. Of the thirteen verses composing this epistle seven are in the First Epistle. The person addressed is commended for her piety, and is warned against false teachers.<br>
</div>
</body>
</html><br><div class="is"><b>JOHN</b></div><br>"JOHN", THIRD EPISTLE OF is addressed to Caius, or Gaius, but whether to the Christian of that name in Macedonia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_29">Acts 19: 29</span>) or in Corinth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM16_23">Romans 16:23</span>) or in Derbe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_4">Acts 20:4</span>) is uncertain. It was written for the purpose of commending to Gaius some Christians who were strangers in the place where he lived, and who had gone thither for the purpose of preaching the gospel (ver. 7).<br>The Second and Third Epistles were probably written soon after the First, and from Ephesus.<br>
