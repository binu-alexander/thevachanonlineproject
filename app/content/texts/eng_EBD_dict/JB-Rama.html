(1.) A city first mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_25">Joshua 18:25</span>, near Gibeah of Benjamin. It was fortified by Baasha, king of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_17-22">1 Kings 15:17-22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R216_1-6">2 Chronicles 16:1-6</span>). Asa, king of Judah, employed Benhadad the Syrian king to drive Baasha from this city(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_18,20">1 Kings 15:18, 20</span>). Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_29">10:29</span>) refers to it, and also Jeremiah, who was once a prisoner there among the other captives of Jerusalem when it was taken by Nebuchadnezzar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_8-12">Jeremiah 39:8-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_1">40:1</span>). Rachel, whose tomb lies close to Bethlehem, is represented as weeping in Ramah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_15">Jeremiah 31:15</span>) for her slaughtered children. This prophecy is illustrated and fulfilled in the re-awakening of Rachel’s grief at the slaughter of the infants in Bethlehem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_18">Matthew 2:18</span></span>). It is identified with the modern village of er-Ram, between Gibeon and Beeroth, about 5 miles due north of Jerusalem. (See SAMUEL.)(2.) A town identified with Rameh, on the border of Asher, about 13 miles south-east of Tyre, “on a solitary hill in the midst of a basin of green fields” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_29">Joshua 19:29</span>).<br>(3.) One of the “fenced cities” of Naphtali (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_36">Joshua 19:36</span>), on a mountain slope, about seven and a half miles west-south-west of Safed, and 15 miles west of the north end of the Sea of Galilee, the present large and well-built village of Rameh.<br>(4.) The same as Ramathaim-zophim (q.v.), a town of Mount Ephraim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_1,19">1 Samuel 1:1, 19</span>).<br>(5.) The same as Ramoth-gilead (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_29">2 Kings 8:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R222_6">2 Chronicles 22:6</span>.<br>
