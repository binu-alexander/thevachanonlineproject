A town of Issachar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_18">Joshua 19:18</span>), where the kings of Israel often resided (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_45">1 Kings 18:45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_1">21:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_30">2 Kings 9:30</span>). Here Elijah met Ahab, Jehu, and Bidkar; and here Jehu executed his dreadful commission against the house of Ahab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_14-37">2 Kings 9:14-37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_1-11">10:1-11</span>). It has been identified with the modern Zerin, on the most western point of the range of Gilboa, reaching down into the great and fertile valley of Jezreel, to which it gave its name.<br>(2.) A town in Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_56">Joshua 15:56</span>), to the south-east of Hebron.<br>Ahinoam, one of David’s wives, probably belonged to this place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_3">1 Samuel 27:3</span>).<br>(3.) A symbolical name given by Hosea to his oldest son (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_4">1:4</span>), in token of a great slaughter predicted by him, like that which had formerly taken place in the plain of Esdraelon (comp. Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_4,5">1:4, 5</span>).<br>

In the valley under Zerin there are two considerable springs, one of which, perhaps that here referred to, “flows from under a sort of cavern in the wall of conglomerate rock which here forms the base of Gilboa. The water is excellent; and issuing from crevices in the rocks, it spreads out at once into a fine limpid pool forty or fifty feet in diameter, full of fish” (Robinson). This may be identical with the“well of Harod” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_1">Judges 7:1</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_25">2 Samuel 23:25</span>), probably the ‘Ain Jalud, i.e., the “spring of Goliath.”

It was the scene of the signal victory gained by the Israelites under Gideon over the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the “children of the east” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_3">Judges 6:3</span>). Two centuries after this the Israelites were here defeated by the Philistines, and Saul and Jonathan, with the flower of the army of Israel, fell (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S131_1-6">1 Samuel 31:1-6</span>).<br>This name was in after ages extended to the whole of the plain of Esdraelon (q.v.). It was only this plain of Jezreel and that north of Lake Huleh that were then accessible to the chariots of the Canaanites (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_21">2 Kings 9:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_15">10:15</span>).<br>
