It lay near the sources of the Jordan, about 4 miles from Paneas. The restless and warlike tribe of Dan (q.v.), looking out for larger possessions, invaded this country and took Laish with its territory. It is identified with the ruin Tell-el-Kady, “the mound of the judge,” to the north of the Waters of Merom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_5">Joshua 11:5</span>).<br>(2.)
