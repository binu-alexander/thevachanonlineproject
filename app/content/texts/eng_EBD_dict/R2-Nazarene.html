Nazaraios) is applied to Christ only once(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_23">Matthew 2:23</span>). In all other cases the word is rendered “of Nazareth”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_24">Mark 1:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_47">10:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_67">14:67</span>, etc.). When this Greek designation was at first applied to our Lord, it was meant simply to denote the place of his residence. In course of time the word became a term of reproach. Thus the word “Nazarene” carries with it an allusion to those prophecies which speak of Christ as “despised of men” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS53_3">Isaiah 53:3</span>). Some, however, think that in this name there is an allusion to the Hebrew netser, which signifies a branch or sprout. It is so applied to the Messiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_1">Isaiah 11:1</span>), i.e., he whom the prophets called the Netse, the “Branch.” The followers of Christ were called “the sect of Nazarenes” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC24_5">Acts 24:5</span>).<br>All over Palestine and Syria this name is still given to Christians. (See NAZARETH.)
