This city is always mentioned next after Sodom, both of which were types of impiety and wickedness(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_20">Genesis 18:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_29">Romans 9:29</span>). Their destruction is mentioned as an“ensample unto those that after should live ungodly” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_6">2 Peter 2:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JD1_4-7">Jude 1:4-7</span>). Their wickedness became proverbial (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_32">Deuteronomy 32:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_9,10">Isaiah 1:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR23_14">Jeremiah 23:14</span>). But that wickedness may be exceeded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_15">Matthew 10:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_11">Mark 6:11</span>). (See DEAD SEA).<br>
