The “iron pan” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK4_3">Ezekiel 4:3</span> (marg., “flat plate “ or “slice”) was probably a mere plate of iron used for baking. The “fire-pans” of <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_3">Exodus 27:3</span></span> were fire-shovels used for taking up coals. The same Hebrew word is rendered“snuff-dishes” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_38">25:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX37_23">37:23</span>) and “censers” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_1">Leviticus 10:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_12">16:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU4_14">Numbers 4:14</span>, etc.). These were probably simply metal vessels employed for carrying burning embers from the brazen altar to the altar of incense.<br>The “frying-pan” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_7">Leviticus 2:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_9">7:9</span> was a pot for boiling.<br>
