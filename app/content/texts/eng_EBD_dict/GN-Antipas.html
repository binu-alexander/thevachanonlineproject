Herod Antipas, a son of Herod the Great by his Samaritan wife Malthace. He was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea during the whole period of our Lord’s life on earth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_7">Luke 23:7</span></span>). He was a frivolous and vain prince, and was chargeable with many infamous crimes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK8_15">Mark 8:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_19">Luke 3:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_31,32">13:31, 32</span>). He beheaded John the Baptist (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_1-12">Matthew 14:1-12</span>) at the instigation of Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Herod-Philip, whom he had married. Pilate sent Christ to him when he was at Jerusalem at the Passover (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_7">Luke 23:7</span></span>). He asked some idle questions of him, and after causing him to be mocked, sent him back again to Pilate. The wife of Chuza, his house-steward, was one of our Lord’s disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK8_3">Luke 8:3</span>).<br>(2.) A “faithful martyr” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_13">Revelation 2:13</span>), of whom nothing more is certainly known.<br>
