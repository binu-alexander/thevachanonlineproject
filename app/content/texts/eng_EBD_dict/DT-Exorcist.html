Many of these professional exorcists were disreputable Jews, like Simon in Samaria and Elymas in Cyprus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_9">8:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_6">13:6</span>).” Other references to exorcism as practised by the Jews are found in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_27">Matthew 12:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_38">Mark 9:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_49,50">Luke 9:49, 50</span>. It would seem that it was an opinion among the Jews that miracles might be wrought by invoking the divine name. Thus also these “vagabond Jews” pretended that they could expel daemons.<br>The power of casting out devils was conferred by Christ on his apostles(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_8">Matthew 10:8</span>), and on the seventy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_17-19">Luke 10:17-19</span>), and was exercised by believers after his ascension (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_17">Mark 16:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_18">Acts 16:18</span>); but this power was never spoken of as exorcism.<br>
