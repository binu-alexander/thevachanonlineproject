From Zoar, the cradle of this tribe, on the south-eastern border of the Dead Sea, they gradually spread over the region on the east of Jordan. Rameses II., the Pharaoh of the Oppression, enumerates Moab (Muab) among his conquests. Shortly before the Exodus, the warlike Amorites crossed the Jordan under Sihon their king and drove the Moabites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_26-30">Numbers 21:26-30</span>) out of the region between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and occupied it, making Heshbon their capital.<br>They were then confined to the territory to the south of the Arnon.<br>On their journey the Israelites did not pass through Moab, but through the“wilderness” to the east (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_8">Deuteronomy 2:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_18">Judges 11:18</span>), at length reaching the country to the north of the Arnon. Here they remained for some time till they had conquered Bashan (see SIHON; OG). The Moabites were alarmed, and their king, Balak, sought aid from the Midianites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_2-4">Numbers 22:2-4</span>). It was while they were here that the visit of Balaam (q.v.) to Balak took place. (See MOSES.) After the Conquest, the Moabites maintained hostile relations with the Israelites, and frequently harassed them in war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_12-30">Judges 3:12-30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_">1 Samuel 14</span>). The story of Ruth, however, shows the existence of friendly relations between Moab and Bethlehem. By his descent from Ruth, David may be said to have had Moabite blood in his veins. Yet there was war between David and the Moabites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_2">2 Samuel 8:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_20">23:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_2">1 Chronicles 18:2</span>), from whom he took great spoil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_2">2 Samuel 8:2</span>, 11, 12; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R111_22">1 Chronicles 11:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_11">18:11</span>).<br>During the one hundred and fifty years which followed the defeat of the Moabites, after the death of Ahab (see MESHA), they regained, apparently, much of their former prosperty. At this time Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_1">15:1</span>) delivered his “burden of Moab,” predicting the coming of judgment on that land (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_3">2 Kings 17:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_9">18:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_25,26">1 Chronicles 5:25, 26</span>). Between the time of Isaiah and the commencement of the Babylonian captivity we have very seldom any reference to Moab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_21">Jeremiah 25:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR27_3">27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_11">40:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_8-10">Zephaniah 2:8-10</span>).<br>After the Return, it was Sanballat, a Moabite, who took chief part in seeking to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_19">Nehemiah 2:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH4_1">4:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH6_1">6:1</span>).<br>
