They were seemingly a class of professing Christians, who sought to introduce into the church a false freedom or licentiousness, thus abusing Paul’s doctrine of grace (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_15,16,19">2 Peter 2:15, 16, 19</span>), and were probably identical with those who held the doctrine of Baalam (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_14">Revelation 2:14</span>.<br>
