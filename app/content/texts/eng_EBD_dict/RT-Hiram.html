Generally “Huram,” one of the sons of Bela (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_5">1 Chronicles 8:5</span>).<br>(2.) Also “Huram” and “Horam,” king of Tyre. He entered into an alliance with David, and assisted him in building his palace by sending him able workmen, and also cedar-trees and fir-trees from Lebanon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_11">2 Samuel 5:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R114_1">1 Chronicles 14:1</span>). After the death of David he entered into a similar alliance with Solomon, and assisted him greatly in building the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_1">1 Kings 5:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_11">9:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R22_3">2 Chronicles 2:3</span>). He also took part in Solomon’s traffic to the Eastern Seas (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_27">1 Kings 9:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_11">10:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R28_18">2 Chronicles 8:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_10">9:10</span>).<br>(3.) The “master workman” whom Hiram sent to Solomon. He was the son of a widow of Dan, and of a Tyrian father. In 2 Chronicles 2:13 “Huram my father” should be Huram Abi, the word “Abi” (rendered here “my father”) being regarded as a proper name, or it may perhaps be a title of distinction given to Huram, and equivalent to “master.” (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_14">1 Kings 7:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_16">2 Chronicles 4:16</span>.) He cast the magnificent brazen works for Solomon’s temple in clay-beds in the valley of Jordan, between Succoth and Zarthan.<br>
