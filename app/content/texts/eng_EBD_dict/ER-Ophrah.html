(1.) A city of Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_23">Joshua 18:23</span>); probably identical with Ephron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R213_19">2 Chronicles 13:19</span>) and Ephraim(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_54">John 11:54</span>).<br>(2.) “Of the Abi-ezrites.” A city of Manasseh, 6 miles south-west of Shechem, the residence of Gideon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_11">Judges 6:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_27,32">8:27, 32</span>). After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_18-21">8:18-21</span>). He then assumed the function of high priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have been. This thing “became a snare” to Gideon and his house. After Gideon’s death his family resided here till they were put to death by Abimelech (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_5">Judges 9:5</span>). It is identified with Ferata.<br>
