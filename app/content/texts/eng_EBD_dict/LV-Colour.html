It is applied to milk (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_12">Genesis 49:12</span>), manna (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_31">Exodus 16:31</span>), snow (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18">Isaiah 1:18</span></span>), horses(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_8">Zechariah 1:8</span></span>), raiment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_8">Ecclesiastes 9:8</span></span>). Another Hebrew word so rendered is applied to marble (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ET1_6">Esther 1:6</span>), and a cognate word to the lily(Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET2_16">2:16</span>). A different term, meaning “dazzling,” is applied to the countenance (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET5_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LM5_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN5_10">5:10</span></span></span>).<br>This colour was an emblem of purity and innocence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_5">Mark 16:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_12">John 20:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV19_8,14">Revelation 19:8, 14</span>), of joy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_8">Ecclesiastes 9:8</span></span>), and also of victory(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_3">Zechariah 6:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV6_2">Revelation 6:2</span>). The hangings of the tabernacle court(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_9">Exodus 27:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX38_9">38:9</span>), the coats, mitres, bonnets, and breeches of the priests(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_27,28">Exodus 39:27,28</span>), and the dress of the high priest on the day of Atonement (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_4,32">Leviticus 16:4,32</span>), were white.<br>Black, applied to the hair (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_31">Leviticus 13:31</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_11">5:11</span>), the complexion(Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV1_5">1:5</span>), and to horses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_2,6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_2">Zechariah 6:2</span>,6</span>). The word rendered “brown” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_32">Genesis 30:32</span> (R.V., “black”) means properly “scorched”, i.e., the colour produced by the influence of the sun’s rays. “Black” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB30_30">Job 30:30</span> means dirty, blackened by sorrow and disease. The word is applied to a mourner’s robes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR8_21">Jeremiah 8:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_2">14:2</span>), to a clouded sky (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_45">1 Kings 18:45</span>), to night (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC3_6">Micah 3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_28">Jeremiah 4:28</span>), and to a brook rendered turbid by melted snow (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB6_16">Job 6:16</span>). It is used as symbolical of evil in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_2,6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_2">Zechariah 6:2</span>, 6</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV6_5">Revelation 6:5</span>. It was the emblem of mourning, affliction, calamity(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_2">Jeremiah 14:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM4_8">Lamentations 4:8</span>; 5:10).<br>Red, applied to blood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_">2 Kings 3</span>;22), a heifer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU19_2">Numbers 19:2</span>), pottage of lentils (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_30">Genesis 25:30</span>), a horse (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_8">Zechariah 1:8</span></span>), wine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_31">Proverbs 23:31</span>), the complexion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_25">Genesis 25:25</span>; Cant. 5:10). This colour is symbolical of bloodshed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC6_2">Zechariah 6:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV6_4">Revelation 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV12_3">1<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_3">2:3</span></span>).<br>Purple, a colour obtained from the secretion of a species of shell-fish (the Murex trunculus) which was found in the Mediterranean, and particularly on the coasts of Phoenicia and Asia Minor. The colouring matter in each separate shell-fish amounted to only a single drop, and hence the great value of this dye. Robes of this colour were worn by kings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_26"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_26">Judges 8:26</span></span>) and high officers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ET8_15">Esther 8:15</span>). They were also worn by the wealthy and luxurious (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR10_9">Jeremiah 10:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_7">Ezekiel 27:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_19">Luke 16:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4">Revelation 17:4</span></span>). With this colour was associated the idea of royalty and majesty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_26"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_26">Judges 8:26</span></span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_10">3:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_5">7:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN5_7,16,29">Daniel 5:7, 16,29</span>).<br>Blue. This colour was also procured from a species of shell-fish, the chelzon of the Hebrews, and the Helix ianthina of modern naturalists. The tint was emblematic of the sky, the deep dark hue of the Eastern sky. This colour was used in the same way as purple. The ribbon and fringe of the Hebrew dress were of this colour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_38">Numbers 15:38</span>). The loops of the curtains (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_4">Exodus 26:4</span>), the lace of the high priest’s breastplate, the robe of the ephod, and the lace on his mitre, were blue (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_28,31,37">Exodus 28:28, 31, 37</span>).<br>Scarlet, or Crimson. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18">Isaiah 1:18</span></span> a Hebrew word is used which denotes the worm or grub whence this dye was procured. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_28,30">Genesis 38:28,30</span>, the word so rendered means “to shine,” and expresses the brilliancy of the colour. The small parasitic insects from which this dye was obtained somewhat resembled the cochineal which is found in Eastern countries. It is called by naturalists Coccus ilics. The dye was procured from the female grub alone. The only natural object to which this colour is applied in Scripture is the lips, which are likened to a scarlet thread (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_3">4:3</span>).<br>Scarlet robes were worn by the rich and luxurious (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_24">2 Samuel 1:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_21">Proverbs 31:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_30">Jeremiah 4:30</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV17_4">Revelation 17:4</span></span>). It was also the hue of the warrior’s dress (Nah. 2:3; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_5">Isaiah 9:5</span>). The Phoenicians excelled in the art of dyeing this colour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R22_7">2 Chronicles 2:7</span>).<br>These four colours--white, purple, blue, and scarlet--were used in the textures of the tabernacle curtains (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_1,31,36">Exodus 26:1, 31, 36</span>), and also in the high priest’s ephod, girdle, and breastplate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_5,6,8,15">Exodus 28:5, 6, 8, 15</span>). Scarlet thread is mentioned in connection with the rites of cleansing the leper(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV14_4,6,51">Leviticus 14:4, 6, 51</span>) and of burning the red heifer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU19_6">Numbers 19:6</span>). It was a crimson thread that Rahab was to bind on her window as a sign that she was to be saved alive (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS2_18">Joshua 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_25">6:25</span>) when the city of Jericho was taken.<br>Vermilion, the red sulphuret of mercury, or cinnabar; a colour used for drawing the figures of idols on the walls of temples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_14">Ezekiel 23:14</span>), or for decorating the walls and beams of houses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14">Jeremiah 22:14</span>).<br>
