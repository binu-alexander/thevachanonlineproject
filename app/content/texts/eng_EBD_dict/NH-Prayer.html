Prayer may be oral or mental, occasional or constant, ejaculatory or formal. It is a“beseeching the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_11">Exodus 32:11</span>); “pouring out the soul before the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_15">1 Samuel 1:15</span>); “praying and crying to heaven” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_20">2 Chronicles 32:20</span>); “seeking unto God and making supplication” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB8_5">Job 8:5</span>); “drawing near to God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS73_28">Psalm 73:28</span>); “bowing the knees” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_14">Ephesians 3:14</span></span>).<br>Prayer presupposes a belief in the personality of God, his ability and willingness to hold intercourse with us, his personal control of all things and of all his creatures and all their actions.<br>Acceptable prayer must be sincere (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_22">Hebrews 10:22</span>), offered with reverence and godly fear, with a humble sense of our own insignificance as creatures and of our own unworthiness as sinners, with earnest importunity, and with unhesitating submission to the divine will. Prayer must also be offered in the faith that God is, and is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and that he will fulfil his word, “Ask, and ye shall receive”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_7,8">Matthew 7:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_22">21:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK11_24">Mark 11:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_13,14">John 1<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS4_1">4:1</span>3, 14</span>), and in the name of Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN16_23,24">16:23, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN15_16">15:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_18">Ephesians 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_20">5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_17">Colossians 3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P12_5">1 Peter 2:5</span>).<br>Prayer is of different kinds, secret (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_6">Matthew 6:6</span>); social, as family prayers, and in social worship; and public, in the service of the sanctuary.<br>Intercessory prayer is enjoined (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_23">Numbers 6:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB42_8">Job 42:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS62_6">Isaiah 62:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS122_6">Psalm 122:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_1">1 Timothy 2:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM5_14">James 5:14</span>), and there are many instances on record of answers having been given to such prayers, e.g., of Abraham(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_18,20">Genesis 17:18, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_23-32">18:23-32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_7,17,18">20:7, 17, 18</span>), of Moses for Pharaoh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_12,13,30,31">Exodus 8:12, 13, 30, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_33">Exodus 9:33</span>), for the Israelites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_11,13">Exodus 17:11, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_11-14,31-34">32:11-14, 31-34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_7,8">Numbers 21:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT9_18,19,25">Deuteronomy 9:18, 19, 25</span>), for Miriam(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_13">Numbers 12:13</span>), for Aaron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT9_20">Deuteronomy 9:20</span>), of Samuel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_5-12">1 Samuel 7:5-12</span>), of Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_">1 Kings 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R26_">2 Chronicles 6</span>), Elijah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_20-23">1 Kings 17:20-23</span>), Elisha (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_33-36">2 Kings 4:33-36</span>), Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_">2 Kings 19</span>), Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K242_2-10">42:2-10</span>), Peter(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_40">Acts <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_40">9:40</span></span>), the church (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_5-12">12:5-12</span>), Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_8">28:8</span>).<br>No rules are anywhere in Scripture laid down for the manner of prayer or the attitude to be assumed by the suppliant. There is mention made of kneeling in prayer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_">1 Kings 8</span>:54; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R26_">2 Chronicles 6</span>:13; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS95_6">Psalm 95:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_23">Isaiah 45:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_41">Luke 22:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_60">Acts 7:60</span>; 9:40; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_14">Ephesians 3:14</span></span>, etc.); of bowing and falling prostrate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_26,52">Genesis 24:26, 52</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_31">Exodus 4:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_27">12:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_39">Matthew 26:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_35">Mark 14:35</span>, etc.); of spreading out the hands (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_">1 Kings 8</span>:22, 38, 54; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS28_2">Psalm 28:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS63_4">63:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS88_9">88:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_8">1 Timothy 2:8</span>, etc.); and of standing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_26">1 Samuel 1:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_">1 Kings 8</span>:14, 55; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_9">2 Chronicles 20:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK11_25">Mark 11:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_11,13">Luke 18:11, 13</span>).<br>If we except the “Lord’s Prayer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_9-13">Matthew 6:9-13</span>), which is, however, rather a model or pattern of prayer than a set prayer to be offered up, we have no special form of prayer for general use given us in Scripture.<br>Prayer is frequently enjoined in Scripture (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_23,27">Exodus 22:23, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K13_5">1 Kings 3:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R27_14">2 Chronicles 7:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS37_4">Psalm 37:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS55_6">Isaiah 55:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_32">Joel 2:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK36_37">Ezekiel 36:37</span>, etc.), and we have very many testimonies that it has been answered (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS3_4">Psalm 3:4</span>; 4:1; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS6_8">6:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_6">18:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS28_6">28:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS30_2">30:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_4">34:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS118_5">118:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM5_16-18">James 5:16-18</span>, etc.).<br>“Abraham’s servant prayed to God, and God directed him to the person who should be wife to his master’s son and heir (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_10-20">Genesis 24:10-20</span>).<br>“Jacob prayed to God, and God inclined the heart of his irritated brother, so that they met in peace and friendship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_24-30">Genesis 32:24-30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN33_1-4">33:1-4</span>).<br>“Samson prayed to God, and God showed him a well where he quenched his burning thirst, and so lived to judge Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG15_18-20">Judges 15:18-20</span>).<br>“David prayed, and God defeated the counsel of Ahithophel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_31">2 Samuel 15:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_20-23">16:20-23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_14-23">17:14-23</span>).<br>“Daniel prayed, and God enabled him both to tell Nebuchadnezzar his dream and to give the interpretation of it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_16-23">Daniel 2: 16-23</span>).<br>“Nehemiah prayed, and God inclined the heart of the king of Persia to grant him leave of absence to visit and rebuild Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH1_11">Nehemiah 1:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_1-6">2:1-6</span>).<br>“Esther and Mordecai prayed, and God defeated the purpose of Haman, and saved the Jews from destruction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ET4_15-17">Esther 4:15-17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET6_7,8">6:7, 8</span>).<br>“The believers in Jerusalem prayed, and God opened the prison doors and set Peter at liberty, when Herod had resolved upon his death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_1-12">Acts 12:1-12</span>).<br>“Paul prayed that the thorn in the flesh might be removed, and his prayer brought a large increase of spiritual strength, while the thorn perhaps remained (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C212_7-10">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</span>).<br>“Prayer is like the dove that Noah sent forth, which blessed him not only when it returned with an olive-leaf in its mouth, but when it never returned at all.”, Robinson’s Job.<br>
