And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S14_19-22">1 Samuel 4:19-22</span>).<br>In her great distress she regarded not “the women that stood by her,” but named the child that was born “Ichabod” i.e., no glory, saying, “The glory is departed from Isreal;” and with that word on her lips she expired.<br>
