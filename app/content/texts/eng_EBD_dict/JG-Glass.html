Various articles both useful and ornamental were made of it, as bottles, vases, etc. A glass bottle with the name of Sargon on it was found among the ruins of the north-west palace of Nimroud. The Hebrew word zekukith (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB28_17">Job 28:17</span>), rendered in the Authorized Version “crystal,” is rightly rendered in the Revised Version“glass.” This is the only allusion to glass found in the Old Testament. It is referred to in the New Testament in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV4_6">Revelation 4:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV15_2">15:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV21_18,21">21:18, 21</span>. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB37_18">Job 37:18</span>, the word rendered “looking-glass” is in the Revised Version properly rendered “mirror,” formed, i.e., of some metal. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX38_8">Exodus 38:8</span>: “looking-glasses” are brazen mirrors, R.V.). A mirror is referred to also in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_23">James 1:23</span>.<br>
