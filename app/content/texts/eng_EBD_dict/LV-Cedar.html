It was stately (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_3-5">Ezekiel 31:3-5</span>), long-branched(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS80_10">Psalm <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS80_10">80:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS92_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS92_12">92:12</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_6-9">Ezekiel 31:6-9</span>), odoriferous (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK4_11">4:11</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK14_6">14:6</span>), durable, and therefore much used for boards, pillars, and ceilings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_9,10">1 Kings 6:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_2">7:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14">Jeremiah 22:14</span>), for masts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_5">Ezekiel 27:5</span>), and for carved images (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_14">Isaiah 44:14</span>).<br>It grew very abundantly in Palestine, and particularly on Lebanon, of which it was “the glory” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS35_2">Isaiah 35:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS60_13">60:13</span>). Hiram supplied Solomon with cedar trees from Lebanon for various purposes connected with the construction of the temple and the king’s palace (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_11">2 Samuel 5:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S27_2,7">7:2, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_6,8,10">1 Kings 5:6, 8,10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_9,10,15,16,18,20">6:9, 10, 15, 16, 18, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_2,3,7,11,12">7:2, 3, 7, 11, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_11">9:11</span>, etc.). Cedars were used also in the building of the second temple under Zerubbabel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_7">Ezra 3:7</span>).<br>Of the ancient cedars of Lebanon there remain now only some seven or eight. They are not standing together. But beside them there are found between three hundred and four hundred of younger growth. They stand in an amphitheatre fronting the west, about 6,400 feet above the level of the sea.<br>The cedar is often figuratively alluded to in the sacred Scriptures. “The mighty conquerors of olden days, the despots of Assyria and the Pharaohs of Egypt, the proud and idolatrous monarchs of Judah, the Hebrew commonwealth itself, the war-like Ammonites of patriarchal times, and the moral majesty of the Messianic age, are all compared to the towering cedar, in its royal loftiness and supremacy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_13">Isaiah 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK17_3,22,23,31">Ezekiel 17:3, 22, 23, 31</span>:3-9; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM2_9">Amos 2:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC11_1,2">Zechariah 11:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB40_17">Job 40:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS29_5">Psalm 29:5</span>; 80:10; 92:12, etc).”, Groser’s Scrip.
