Eggs deserted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_14">Isaiah 10:14</span>), of a bird (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_6">Deuteronomy 22:6</span>), an ostrich (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB39_14">Job 39:14</span>), the cockatrice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS59_5">Isaiah 59:5</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK11_12">Luke 11:12</span>, an egg is contrasted with a scorpion, which is said to be very like an egg in its appearance, so much so as to be with difficulty at times distinguished from it. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB6_6">Job 6:6</span> (“the white of an egg”) the word for egg (hallamuth’) occurs nowhere else. It has been translated “purslain”(R.V. marg.), and the whole phrase “purslain-broth”, i.e., broth made of that herb, proverbial for its insipidity; and hence an insipid discourse. Job applies this expression to the speech of Eliphaz as being insipid and dull.<br>But the common rendering, “the white of an egg”, may be satisfactorily maintained.<br>
