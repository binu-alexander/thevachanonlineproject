The word means given, i.e., “those set apart”, viz., to the menial work of the sanctuary for the Levites. The name occurs seventeen times, and in each case in the Authorized Version incorrectly terminates in “s”, “Nethinims;” in the Revised Version, correctly without the “s” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_70">Ezra 2:70</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER7_7,24">7:7, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER8_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ER8_20">8:20</span></span>, etc.). The tradition is that the Gibeonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_27">Joshua 9:27</span>) were the original caste, afterwards called Nethinim. Their numbers were added to afterwards from captives taken in battle; and they were formally given by David to the Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER8_20">Ezra 8:20</span>), and so were called Nethinim, i.e., the given ones, given to the Levites to be their servants. Only 612 Nethinim returned from Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_58">Ezra 2:58</span>; 8:20). They were under the control of a chief from among themselves(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_43">2:43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_46">Nehemiah 7:46</span>). No reference to them appears in the New Testament, because it is probable that they became merged in the general body of the Jewish people.<br>
