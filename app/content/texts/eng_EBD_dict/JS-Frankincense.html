It was one of the ingredients in the perfume of the sanctuary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_34">Exodus 30:34</span>), and was used as an accompaniment of the meat-offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_1,16">Leviticus 2:1, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_15">6:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_7">24:7</span>). When burnt it emitted a fragrant odour, and hence the incense became a symbol of the Divine name (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ML1_11">Malachi 1:11</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="ML1_3">1:3</span>) and an emblem of prayer(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS141_2">Psalm 141:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_10">Luke 1:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV5_8">Revelation 5:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV8_3">8:3</span>).<br>This frankincense, or olibanum, used by the Jews in the temple services is not to be confounded with the frankincense of modern commerce, which is an exudation of the Norway spruce fir, the Pinus abies. It was probably a resin from the Indian tree known to botanists by the name of Boswellia serrata or thurifera, which grows to the height of forty feet.<br>
