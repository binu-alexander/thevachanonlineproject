Among the early Jews, from various causes, the difference between a wife and a concubine was less marked than it would be amongst us. The concubine was a wife of secondary rank. There are various laws recorded providing for their protection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_7">Exodus 21:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_10-14">Deuteronomy 21:10-14</span>), and setting limits to the relation they sustained to the household to which they belonged (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_14">Genesis 21:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_6">25:6</span>). They had no authority in the family, nor could they share in the household government.<br>The immediate cause of concubinage might be gathered from the conjugal histories of Abraham and Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN16_">Genesis 16</span>;30). But in process of time the custom of concubinage degenerated, and laws were made to restrain and regulate it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_7">Exodus 21:7</span>-9).<br>Christianity has restored the sacred institution of marriage to its original character, and concubinage is ranked with the sins of fornication and adultery (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_5-9">Matthew 19:5-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C17_2">1 Corinthians 7:2</span>).<br>
