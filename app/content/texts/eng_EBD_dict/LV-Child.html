Thus Joseph is called a child at the time when he was probably about sixteen years of age (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_3">Genesis 37:3</span>); and Benjamin is so called when he was above thirty years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN44_20">44:20</span>). Solomon called himself a little child when he came to the kingdom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K13_7">1 Kings 3:7</span>).<br>The descendants of a man, however remote, are called his children; as, “the children of Edom,” “the children of Moab,” “the children of Israel.” In the earliest times mothers did not wean their children till they were from thirty months to three years old; and the day on which they were weaned was kept as a festival day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_8">Genesis 21:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_7,9">Exodus 2:7, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_22-24">1 Samuel 1:22-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_16">Matthew 21:16</span>). At the age of five, children began to learn the arts and duties of life under the care of their fathers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT6_20-25">Deuteronomy 6:20-25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT11_19">11:19</span>).<br>To have a numerous family was regarded as a mark of divine favour(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_30">Genesis 11:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_1">30:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_5">1 Samuel 2:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_23">2 Samuel 6:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS127_3">Psalm 127:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS128_3">128:3</span>).<br>Figuratively the name is used for those who are ignorant or narrow-minded(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_16">Matthew 11:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_32">Luke 7:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C113_11">1 Corinthians 13:11</span>). “When I was a child, I spake as a child.” “Brethren, be not children in understanding” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C114_20">1 Corinthians 14:20</span>). “That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_14">Ephesians 4:14</span>).<br>Children are also spoken of as representing simplicity and humility(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_13-15">Matthew 19:13-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_13-16">Mark 10:13-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_15-17">Luke 18:15-17</span>). Believers are“children of light” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_8">Luke 16:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H15_5">1 Thessalonians 5:5</span>) and “children of obedience” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_14">1 Peter 1:14</span>).<br>
