It was worn by Samuel, and also by David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_14">2 Samuel 6:14</span>). It was made of fine linen, and consisted of two pieces, which hung from the neck, and covered both the back and front, above the tunic and outer garment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_31">Exodus 28:31</span>). That of the high priest was embroidered with divers colours. The two pieces were joined together over the shoulders (hence in Latin called superhumerale) by clasps or buckles of gold or precious stones, and fastened round the waist by a “curious girdle of gold, blue, purple, and fine twined linen” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_6-12">28:6-12</span>).<br>The breastplate, with the Urim and Thummim, was attached to the ephod.<br>
