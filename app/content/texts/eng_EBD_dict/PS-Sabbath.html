It is first mentioned as having been instituted in Paradise, when man was in innocence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_2">Genesis 2:2</span>). “The sabbath was made for man,” as a day of rest and refreshment for the body and of blessing to the soul.<br>It is next referred to in connection with the gift of manna to the children of Israel in the wilderness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_23">Exodus 16:23</span>); and afterwards, when the law was given from Sinai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_11">20:11</span>), the people were solemnly charged to “remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.” Thus it is spoken of as an institution already existing.<br>In the Mosaic law strict regulations were laid down regarding its observance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_2,3">Exodus 35:2, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_3">Leviticus 23:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_34">26:34</span>). These were peculiar to that dispensation.<br>In the subsequent history of the Jews frequent references are made to the sanctity of the Sabbath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS56_2,4,6,7">Isaiah 56:2, 4, 6, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS58_13,14">58:13, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR17_20-22">Jeremiah 17:20-22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH13_19">Nehemiah 13:19</span>). In later times they perverted the Sabbath by their traditions. Our Lord rescued it from their perversions, and recalled to them its true nature and intent (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_10-13">Matthew 12:10-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK2_27">Mark 2:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_10-17">Luke 13:10-17</span>).<br>The Sabbath, originally instituted for man at his creation, is of permanent and universal obligation. The physical necessities of man require a Sabbath of rest. He is so constituted that his bodily welfare needs at least one day in seven for rest from ordinary labour. Experience also proves that the moral and spiritual necessities of men also demand a Sabbath of rest. “I am more and more sure by experience that the reason for the observance of the Sabbath lies deep in the everlasting necessities of human nature, and that as long as man is man the blessedness of keeping it, not as a day of rest only, but as a day of spiritual rest, will never be annulled. I certainly do feel by experience the eternal obligation, because of the eternal necessity, of the Sabbath. The soul withers without it. It thrives in proportion to its observance. The Sabbath was made for man. God made it for men in a certain spiritual state because they needed it. The need, therefore, is deeply hidden in human nature. He who can dispense with it must be holy and spiritual indeed. And he who, still unholy and unspiritual, would yet dispense with it is a man that would fain be wiser than his Maker” (F. W.<br>Robertson).<br>The ancient Babylonian calendar, as seen from recently recovered inscriptions on the bricks among the ruins of the royal palace, was based on the division of time into weeks of seven days. The Sabbath is in these inscriptions designated Sabattu, and defined as “a day of rest for the heart” and “a day of completion of labour.” The change of the day. Originally at creation the seventh day of the week was set apart and consecrated as the Sabbath. The first day of the week is now observed as the Sabbath. Has God authorized this change? There is an obvious distinction between the Sabbath as an institution and the particular day set apart for its observance. The question, therefore, as to the change of the day in no way affects the perpetual obligation of the Sabbath as an institution. Change of the day or no change, the Sabbath remains as a sacred institution the same. It cannot be abrogated.<br>If any change of the day has been made, it must have been by Christ or by his authority. Christ has a right to make such a change (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK2_23-28">Mark 2:23-28</span>). As Creator, Christ was the original Lord of the Sabbath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_10">Hebrews 1:10</span>). It was originally a memorial of creation. A work vastly greater than that of creation has now been accomplished by him, the work of redemption. We would naturally expect just such a change as would make the Sabbath a memorial of that greater work.<br>True, we can give no text authorizing the change in so many words. We have no express law declaring the change. But there are evidences of another kind. We know for a fact that the first day of the week has been observed from apostolic times, and the necessary conclusion is, that it was observed by the apostles and their immediate disciples. This, we may be sure, they never would have done without the permission or the authority of their Lord.<br>After his resurrection, which took place on the first day of the week(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_1">Matthew 28:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_2">Mark 16:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_1">Luke 24:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_1">John 20:1</span>), we never find Christ meeting with his disciples on the seventh day. But he specially honoured the first day by manifesting himself to them on four separate occasions(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_9">Matthew 28:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_34,18-33">Luke 24:34, 18-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_1">John 20:1</span>9-23). Again, on the next first day of the week, Jesus appeared to his disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_26">John 20:26</span>).<br>Some have calculated that Christ’s ascension took place on the first day of the week. And there can be no doubt that the descent of the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was on that day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_1">Acts 2:1</span>). Thus Christ appears as instituting a new day to be observed by his people as the Sabbath, a day to be henceforth known amongst them as the “Lord’s day.” The observance of this “Lord’s day” as the Sabbath was the general custom of the primitive churches, and must have had apostolic sanction (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_3-7">Acts 20:3-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C116_1,2">1 Corinthians 16:1, 2</span>) and authority, and so the sanction and authority of Jesus Christ.<br>The words “at her sabbaths” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_7">Lamentations 1:7</span>, A.V.) ought probably to be, as in the Revised Version, “at her desolations.”
