When used as a proper name, the Hebrew word so rendered has the article “the adversary” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_6-12">Job 1:6-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB2_1-7">2:1-7</span>). In the New Testament it is used as interchangeable with Diabolos, or the devil, and is so used more than thirty times.<br>He is also called “the dragon,” “the old serpent” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV12_9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV20_2">20:2</span>);“the prince of this world” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_31">John 12:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_30">14:30</span>); “the prince of the power of the air” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_2">Ephesians 2:2</span></span>); “the God of this world” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C24_4">2 Corinthians 4:4</span>); “the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_2">Ephesians 2:2</span></span>).<br>The distinct personality of Satan and his activity among men are thus obviously recognized. He tempted our Lord in the wilderness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_1-11">Matthew 4:1-11</span>). He is “Beelzebub, the prince of the devils” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_24">12:24</span>). He is “the constant enemy of God, of Christ, of the divine kingdom, of the followers of Christ, and of all truth; full of falsehood and all malice, and exciting and seducing to evil in every possible way.” His power is very great in the world. He is a “roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_8">1 Peter 5:8</span>).<br>Men are said to be “taken captive by him” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T22_26">2 Timothy 2:26</span>). Christians are warned against his “devices” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C22_11">2 Corinthians 2:11</span>), and called on to“resist” him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM4_7">James 4:7</span>). Christ redeems his people from “him that had the power of death, that is, the devil” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_14">Hebrews 2:14</span>). Satan has the “power of death,” not as Lord, but simply as executioner.<br>
