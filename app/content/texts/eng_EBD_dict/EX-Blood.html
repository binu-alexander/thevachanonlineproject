As food, prohibited in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_4">Genesis 9:4</span>, where the use of animal food is first allowed. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_23">Deuteronomy 12:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV3_17">Leviticus 3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_26">7:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV17_10-14">17:10-14</span>. The injunction to abstain from blood is renewed in the decree of the council of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_29">Acts 15:29</span>). It has been held by some, and we think correctly, that this law of prohibition was only ceremonial and temporary; while others regard it as still binding on all. Blood was eaten by the Israelites after the battle of Gilboa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_32-34">1 Samuel 14:32-34</span>).<br>(2.) The blood of sacrifices was caught by the priest in a basin, and then sprinkled seven times on the altar; that of the passover on the doorposts and lintels of the houses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_">Exodus 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_5-7">Leviticus 4:5-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_14-19">16:14-19</span>). At the giving of the law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_8">Exodus 24:8</span>) the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled on the people as well as on the altar, and thus the people were consecrated to God, or entered into covenant with him, hence the blood of the covenant(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_28">Matthew 26:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_19,20">Hebrews 9:19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_29">10:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_20">13:20</span>).<br>(3.) Human blood. The murderer was to be punished (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_5">Genesis 9:5</span>). The blood of the murdered “crieth for vengeance” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_10">Genesis 4:10</span>). The “avenger of blood” was the nearest relative of the murdered, and he was required to avenge his death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_24,27">Numbers 35:24, 27</span>). No satisfaction could be made for the guilt of murder (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_31">Numbers 35:31</span>).<br>(4.) Blood used metaphorically to denote race (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_26">Acts 17:26</span>), and as a symbol of slaughter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_3">Isaiah 34:3</span>). To “wash the feet in blood” means to gain a great victory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS58_10">Psalm 58:10</span>). Wine, from its red colour, is called “the blood of the grape” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_11">Genesis 49:11</span>). Blood and water issued from our Saviour’s side when it was pierced by the Roman soldier (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_34">John 19:34</span>).<br>This has led pathologists to the conclusion that the proper cause of Christ’s death was rupture of the heart. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS69_20">Psalm 69:20</span>.)
