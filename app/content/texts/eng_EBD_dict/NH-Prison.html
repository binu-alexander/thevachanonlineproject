Then Potiphar, “Joseph’s master, took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN39_20-23">Genesis 39:20-23</span>). The Hebrews word here used (sohar) means properly a round tower or fortress. It seems to have been a part of Potiphar’s house, a place in which state prisoners were kept.<br>The Mosaic law made no provision for imprisonment as a punishment. In the wilderness two persons were “put in ward” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_12">Leviticus 24:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_34">Numbers 15:34</span>), but it was only till the mind of God concerning them should be ascertained. Prisons and prisoners are mentioned in the book of Psalms(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU69_33">69:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU79_11">79:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU142_7">142:7</span>). Samson was confined in a Philistine prison (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21,25">Judges 16:21, 25</span>). In the subsequent history of Israel frequent references are made to prisons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_27">1 Kings 22:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_4">2 Kings 17:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_27,29">25:27, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R216_10">2 Chronicles 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_7">Isaiah 42:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_2">Jeremiah 32:2</span>). Prisons seem to have been common in New Testament times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_2">Matthew 11:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_36,43">25:36, 43</span>). The apostles were put into the “common prison” at the instance of the Jewish council (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC5_18,23">Acts 5:18, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_3">8:3</span>); and at Philippi Paul and Silas were thrust into the “inner prison”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_24">16:24</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_3">4:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_4,5">12:4, 5</span>).<br>
