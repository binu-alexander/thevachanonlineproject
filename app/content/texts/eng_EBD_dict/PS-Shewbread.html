They were renewed every Sabbath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_5-9">Leviticus 24:5-9</span>), and those that were removed to give place to the new ones were to be eaten by the priests only in the holy place (see 1 Samuel 21:3-6; comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_3,4">Matthew 12:3, 4</span>).<br>The number of the loaves represented the twelve tribes of Israel, and also the entire spiritual Israel, “the true Israel;” and the placing of them on the table symbolized the entire consecration of Israel to the Lord, and their acceptance of God as their God.

Two staves, plated with gold, passed through golden rings, were used for carrying it.<br>
