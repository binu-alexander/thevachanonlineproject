After his reconciliation with Saul at Engedi(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_1-8">24:1-8</span>), David returned to Hachilah, where he had fixed his quarters. The Ziphites treacherously informed Saul of this, and he immediately (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_1-4">26:1-4</span>) renewed his pursuit of David, and “pitched in the hill of Hachilah.” David and his nephew Abishai stole at night into the midst of Saul’s camp, when they were all asleep, and noiselessly removed the royal spear and the cruse from the side of the king, and then, crossing the intervening valley to the height on the other side, David cried to the people, and thus awoke the sleepers. He then addressed Saul, who recognized his voice, and expostulated with him. Saul professed to be penitent; but David could not put confidence in him, and he now sought refuge at Ziklag. David and Saul never afterwards met. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_13-25">1 Samuel 26:13-25</span>).<br>
