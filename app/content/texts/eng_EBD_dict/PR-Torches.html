Although it was the time of full moon, yet in the valley of the Kidron “there fell great, deep shadows from the declivity of the mountain and projecting rocks; there were there caverns and grottos, into which a fugitive might retreat; finally, there were probably a garden-house and tower, into whose gloom it might be necessary for a searcher to throw light around.” Lange’s Commentary. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NM2_3">Nahum 2:3</span>,“torches,” Revised Version, “steel,” probably should be “scythes” for war-chariots.)
