This was Samson’s birthplace (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_2,25">Judges 13:2, 25</span>), and near it he found a grave (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_31">16:31</span>). It was situated on the crest of a hill overlooking the valley of Sorek, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R211_10">2 Chronicles 11:10</span>).<br>It has been identified with Sur’ah, in the Wady Surar, 8 miles west of Jerusalem. It is noticed on monuments in the fifteenth century B.C. as attacked by the Abiri or Hebrews.<br>
