A son of Ahitub, of the line of Eleazer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_3">1 Chronicles 24:3</span>), high priest in the time of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_25">2 Samuel 20:25</span>) and Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_4">1 Kings 4:4</span>). He is first mentioned as coming to take part with David at Hebron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_27,28">1 Chronicles 12:27, 28</span>). He was probably on this account made ruler over the Aaronites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_17">27:17</span>). Zadok and Abiathar acted as high priests on several important occasions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_11">1 Chronicles 15:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_24-29,35,36">2 Samuel 15:24-29, 35, 36</span>); but when Adonijah endeavoured to secure the throne, Abiathar went with him, and therefore Solomon “thrust him out from being high priest,” and Zadok, remaining faithful to David, became high priest alone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_27,35">1 Kings 2:27, 35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_22">1 Chronicles 29:22</span>). In him the line of Phinehas resumed the dignity, and held it till the fall of Jerusalem. He was succeeded in his sacred office by his son Azariah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_2">1 Kings 4:2</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_3-9">1 Chronicles 6:3-9</span>).<br>(2.) The father of Jerusha, who was wife of King Uzziah, and mother of King Jotham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_33">2 Kings 15:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R227_1">2 Chronicles 27:1</span>).<br>(3.) “The scribe” set over the treasuries of the temple by Nehemiah along with a priest and a Levite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH13_13">Nehemiah 13:13</span>).<br>(4.) The sons of Baana, one of those who assisted in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_4">Nehemiah 3:4</span>).<br>
