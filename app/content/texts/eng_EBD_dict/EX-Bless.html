God blesses his people when he bestows on them some gift temporal or spiritual (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_22">Genesis 1:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_35">24:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB42_12">Job 42:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_2">Psalm 45:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_24,35">104:24, 35</span>).<br>(2.) We bless God when we thank him for his mercies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS103_1,2">Psalm 103:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS145_1,2">145:1, 2</span>).<br>(3.) A man blesses himself when he invokes God’s blessing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS65_16">Isaiah 65:16</span>), or rejoices in God’s goodness to him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_19">Deuteronomy 29:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS49_18">Psalm 49:18</span>).<br>(4.) One blesses another when he expresses good wishes or offers prayer to God for his welfare (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_60">Genesis 24:60</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_55">31:55</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_20">1 Samuel 2:20</span>). Sometimes blessings were uttered under divine inspiration, as in the case of Noah, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_26,27">Genesis 9:26, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_28,29,40">27:28, 29, 40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN48_15-20">48:15-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_1-28">49:1-28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_">Deuteronomy 33</span>). The priests were divinely authorized to bless the people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT10_8">Deuteronomy 10:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_22-27">Numbers 6:22-27</span>). We have many examples of apostolic benediction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C213_14">2 Corinthians 13:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_23,24">Ephesians 6:23, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H23_16,18">2 Thessalonians 3:16, 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_20,21">Hebrews 13:20, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_10,11">1 Peter 5:10, 11</span>).<br>(5.) Among the Jews in their thank-offerings the master of the feast took a cup of wine in his hand, and after having blessed God for it and for other mercies then enjoyed, handed it to his guests, who all partook of it. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS116_13">Psalm 116:13</span> refers to this custom. It is also alluded to in 1 Corinthians 10:16, where the apostle speaks of the “cup of blessing.”
