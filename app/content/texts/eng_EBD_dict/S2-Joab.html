One of the three sons of Zeruiah, David’s sister, and “captain of the host” during the whole of David’s reign(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_13">2 Samuel 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_7">10:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_1">11:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_15">1 Kings 11:15</span>). His father’s name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_32">2 Samuel 2:32</span>). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_13">2 Samuel 2:13</span>-32), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_22-27">3:22-27</span>). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of “prince of the king’s army” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_6-10">2 Samuel 5:6-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_34">1 Chronicles 27:34</span>). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_15">1 Kings 11:15</span>, 16); and (3) against the Ammonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_7-19">2 Samuel 10:7-19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_1,11">11:1, 11</span>). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_14-25">11:14-25</span>). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_1-14">18:1-14</span>). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab’s cousin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_1-13">2 Samuel 20:1-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_13">19:13</span>). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father’s injunction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_29">2 Samuel 3:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_5-13">20:5-13</span>), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the“wilderness,” probably in the north-east of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_5,28-34">1 Kings 2:5, 28-34</span>).<br>Benaiah succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the army.<br>(2.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_14">1 Chronicles 4:14</span>.<br>(3.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_6">Ezra 2:6</span>.<br>
