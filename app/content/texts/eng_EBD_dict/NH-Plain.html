Hebrews ‘abel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_33">Judges 11:33</span>), a “grassy plain” or “meadow.” Instead of “plains of the vineyards,” as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version has “Abel-cheramim” (q.v.), comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_22">Judges <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_2">11:2</span>2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R216_4">2 Chronicles 16:4</span>.<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘elon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_6">Genesis 12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_18">13:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_13">14:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_1">18:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT11_30">Deuteronomy 11:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_6">Judges 9:6</span>), more correctly “oak,” as in the Revised Version; margin,“terebinth.”(3.) Hebrews bik’ah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_2">Genesis 11:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH6_2">Nehemiah 6:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_23">Ezekiel 3:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_1">Daniel 3:1</span>), properly a valley, as rendered in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_4">Isaiah 40:4</span>, a broad plain between mountains. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_5">Amos 1:5</span> the margin of Authorized Version has“Bikathaven.”(4.) Hebrews kikar, “the circle,” used only of the Ghor, or the low ground along the Jordan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_10-12">Genesis 13:10-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_17,25,28,29">19:17, 25, 28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_3">Deuteronomy 34:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_23">2 Samuel 18:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_46">1 Kings 7:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_17">2 Chronicles 4:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_22">Nehemiah 3:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_28">12:28</span>), the floor of the valley through which it flows. This name is applied to the Jordan valley as far north as Succoth.<br>(5.) Hebrews mishor, “level ground,” smooth, grassy table-land(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_10">Deuteronomy 3:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_43">4:43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_9,16,17,21">Joshua 13:9, 16, 17, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS20_8">20:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_21">Jeremiah 48:21</span>), an expanse of rolling downs without rock or stone. In these passages, with the article prefixed, it denotes the plain in the tribe of Reuben. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_10">2 Chronicles 26:10</span> the plain of Judah is meant. Jerusalem is called “the rock of the plain” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR21_13">Jeremiah 21:13</span>, because the hills on which it is built rise high above the plain.<br>(6.) Hebrews ‘arabah, the valley from the Sea of Galilee southward to the Dead Sea (the “sea of the plain,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_25">2 Kings 14:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_1">Deuteronomy 1:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_8">2:8</span>), a distance of about 70 miles. It is called by the modern Arabs the Ghor. This Hebrew name is found in Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_18">Joshua 18:18</span>), and is uniformly used in the Revised Version. Down through the centre of this plain is a ravine, from 200 to 300 yards wide, and from 50 to 100 feet deep, through which the Jordan flows in a winding course. This ravine is called the “lower plain.” The name Arabah is also applied to the whole Jordan valley from Mount Hermon to the eastern branch of the Red Sea, a distance of about 200 miles, as well as to that portion of the valley which stretches from the Sea of Galilee to the same branch of the Red Sea, i.e., to the Gulf of Akabah about 100 miles in all.<br>(7.) Hebrews shephelah, “low ground,” “low hill-land,” rendered “vale” or“valley” in Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_1">Joshua 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_40">10:40</span>; 11:2; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_8">12:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_9">Judges 1:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_27">1 Kings 10:27</span>). In Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_28">1 Chronicles 27:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_10">2 Chronicles 26:10</span>) it is also rendered “low country.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR17_26">Jeremiah 17:26</span>, Obad. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR1_19">1:19</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_7">Zechariah 7:7</span></span>, “plain.” The Revised Version renders it uniformly “low land.” When it is preceded by the article, as in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_7">Deuteronomy 1:7</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_16">Joshua 11:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_33">15:33</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_44">Jeremiah 32:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_13">33:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_7">Zechariah 7:7</span></span>, “the shephelah,” it denotes the plain along the Mediterranean from Joppa to Gaza, “the plain of the Philistines.” (See VALLEY.)
