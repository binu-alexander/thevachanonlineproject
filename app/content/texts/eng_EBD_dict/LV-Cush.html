A son, probably the eldest, of Ham, and the father of Nimrod (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_8">Genesis 10:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_10">1 Chronicles 1:10</span>). From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_13">Genesis 2:13</span>, R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_10">Ezekiel <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS29_10">29:10</span></span>, A.V.<br>“Ethiopia,” Hebrews Cush), with which it is generally associated (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_31">Psalm 68:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_1">Isaiah 18:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR46_9">Jeremiah 46:9</span>, etc.). It stands also associated with Elam(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_11">Isaiah 11:11</span>), with Persia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK38_5">Ezekiel 38:5</span>), and with the Sabeans (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_14">Isaiah 45:14</span>). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris.<br>But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_4-6">30:4-6</span>) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_1">Isaiah 18:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP3_10">Zephaniah 3:10</span>, Hebrews Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites “from Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.” The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation.<br>(2.) A Benjamite of this name is mentioned in the title of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS7_">Psalm 7</span>. “Cush was probably a follower of Saul, the head of his tribe, and had sought the friendship of David for the purpose of ‘rewarding evil to him that was at peace with him.’”
