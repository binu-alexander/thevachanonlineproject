The khans or caravanserais, which correspond to the European inn, are not alluded to in the Old Testament. The “inn” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_24">Exodus 4:24</span> was just the halting-place of the caravan. In later times khans were erected for the accommodation of travellers. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_7">Luke 2:7</span> the word there so rendered denotes a place for loosing the beasts of their burdens. It is rendered“guest-chamber” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_14">Mark 14:14</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_11">Luke 22:11</span>. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_34">Luke 10:34</span> the word so rendered is different. That inn had an “inn-keeper,” who attended to the wants of travellers.<br>
