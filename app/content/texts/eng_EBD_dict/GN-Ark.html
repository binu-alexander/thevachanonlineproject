It was 100 years in building (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN5_32">Genesis 5:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_6">7:6</span>). It was intended to preserve certain persons and animals from the deluge which God was about to bring over the earth. It contained eight persons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_13">Genesis 7:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_5">2 Peter 2:5</span>), and of all “clean” animals seven pairs, and of “unclean” one pair, and of birds seven pairs of each sort (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_2,3">Genesis 7:2, 3</span>). It was in the form of an oblong square, with flat bottom and sloping roof. Traditions of the Deluge, by which the race of man was swept from the earth, and of the ark of Noah have been found existing among all nations.<br>The ark of bulrushes in which the infant Moses was laid (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_3">Exodus 2:3</span>) is called in the Hebrew teebah, a word derived from the Egyptian teb, meaning “a chest.” It was daubed with slime and with pitch. The bulrushes of which it was made were the papyrus reed.<br>The sacred ark is designated by a different Hebrew word, ’aron’, which is the common name for a chest or coffer used for any purpose (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_26">Genesis 50:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K212_9,10">2 Kings 12:9, 10</span>). It is distinguished from all others by such titles as the “ark of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S13_3">1 Samuel 3:3</span>), “ark of the covenant” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS3_6">Joshua 3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_4">Hebrews 9:4</span></span>),“ark of the testimony”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_22">Exodus 25:22</span>).<br>It was made of acacia or shittim wood, a cubit and a half broad and high and two cubits long, and covered all over with the purest gold. Its upper surface or lid, the mercy-seat, was surrounded with a rim of gold; and on each of the ARK OF THE COVENANT two sides were two gold rings, in which were placed two gold-covered poles by which the ark could be carried (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU7_9">Numbers 7:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_21">10:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU4_5,19,20">4:5,19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_3,6">1 Kings 8:3, 6</span>). Over the ark, at the two extremities, were two cherubim, with their faces turned toward each other (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_2">Leviticus 16:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU7_89">Numbers 7:89</span>). Their outspread wings over the top of the ark formed the throne of God, while the ark itself was his footstool (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_10-22">Exodus 25:10-22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX37_1-9">37:1-9</span>). The ark was deposited in the “holy of holies,” and was so placed that one end of the poles by which it was carried touched the veil which separated the two apartments of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_8">1 Kings 8:8</span>). The two tables of stone which constituted the“testimony” or evidence of God’s covenant with the people(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT31_26">Deuteronomy 31:26</span>), the “pot of manna” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_33">Exodus 16:33</span>), and “Aaron’s rod that budded” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU17_10">Numbers 17:10</span>), were laid up in the ark (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_4">Hebrews 9:4</span></span>).<br>(See TABERNACLE) The ark and the sanctuary were “the beauty of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LM2_1">Lamentations 2:1</span>). During the journeys of the Israelites the ark was carried by the priests in advance of the host (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU4_5,6">Numbers 4:5, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_33-36">10:33-36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_1">Psalm 68:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_8">132:8</span>). It was borne by the priests into the bed of the Jordan, which separated, opening a pathway for the whole of the host to pass over (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS3_15,16">Joshua 3:15, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS4_7,10,11,17,18">4:7, 10, 11, 17, 18</span>). It was borne in the procession round Jericho (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_4,6,8,11,12">Joshua 6:4, 6, 8, 11, 12</span>). When carried it was always wrapped in the veil, the badgers’ skins, and blue cloth, and carefully concealed even from the eyes of the Levites who carried it. After the settlement of Israel in Palestine the ark remained in the tabernacle at Gilgal for a season, and was then removed to Shiloh till the time of Eli, between 300 and 400 years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR7_12">Jeremiah 7:12</span>), when it was carried into the field of battle so as to secure, as they supposed, victory to the Hebrews, and was taken by the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S14_3-11">1 Samuel 4:3-11</span>), who sent it back after retaining it seven months (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_7,8">1 Samuel 5:7, 8</span>). It remained then at Kirjath-jearim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_1,2">7:1,2</span>) till the time of David (twenty years), who wished to remove it to Jerusalem; but the proper mode of removing it having been neglected, Uzzah was smitten with death for putting “forth his hand to the ark of God,” and in consequence of this it was left in the house of Obed-edom in Gath-rimmon for three months (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_1-11">2 Samuel 6:1-11</span>), at the end of which time David removed it in a grand procession to Jerusalem, where it was kept till a place was prepared for it (12-19). It was afterwards deposited by Solomon in the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_6-9">1 Kings 8:6-9</span>). When the Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem and plundered the temple, the ark was probably taken away by Nebuchadnezzar and destroyed, as no trace of it is afterwards to be found. The absence of the ark from the second temple was one of the points in which it was inferior to the first temple.<br>
