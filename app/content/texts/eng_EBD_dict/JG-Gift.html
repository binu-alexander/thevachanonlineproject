An gratuity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR19_6">Proverbs 19:6</span>) to secure favour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR18_16">18:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR21_14">21:14</span>), a thank-offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_11">Numbers 18:11</span>), or a dowry (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_12">Genesis 34:12</span>).<br>(2.) An oblation or proppitatory gift (2Sa 8:2,6; 1Ch 18:2,6; 2Ch 26:8; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_12">Psalm 45:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS72_10">72:10</span>).<br>(3.) A bribe to a judge to obtain a favourable verdict (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_8">Exodus 23:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_19">Deuteronomy 16:19</span>).<br>(4.) Simply a thing given (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_11">Matthew 7:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK11_13">Luke 11:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_8">Ephesians 4:8</span>); sacrifical (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_23,24">Matthew 5:23, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_4">8:4</span>); eleemosynary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_1">Luke 21:1</span>); a gratuity(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_10">John 4:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_20">Acts 8:20</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_38">Acts 2:38</span> the generic word dorea is rendered“gift.” It differs from the charisma (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C112_4">1 Corinthians 12:4</span>) as denoting not miraculous powers but the working of a new spirit in men, and that spirit from God.<br>The giving of presents entered largely into the affairs of common life in the East. The nature of the presents was as various as were the occasions: food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_7">1 Samuel 9:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_20">16:20</span>), sheep and cattle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_13-15">Genesis 32:13-15</span>), gold (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_11">2 Samuel 18:11</span>), jewels (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_53">Genesis 24:53</span>), furniture, and vessels for eating and drinking (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_28">2 Samuel 17:28</span>); delicacies, as spices, honey, etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_25">1 Kings 10:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_22">2 Kings 5: 22</span>). The mode of presentation was with as much parade as possible: the presents were conveyed by the hands of servants (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_18">Judges 3:18</span>), or still better, on the backs of beasts of burden (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_9">2 Kings 8:9</span>). The refusal of a present was regarded as a high indignity; and this constituted the aggravated insult noticed in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_11">Matthew 22:11</span>, the marriage robe having been offered and refused.<br>
