It is the drain by which the waters of the plain of Esdraelon and of the mountains that surround it find their way to the sea. It bears the modern name of Nahr el-Mokattah, i.e., “the river of slaughter” (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_40"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_40">1 Kings 18:40</span></span>). In the triumphal song of Deborah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_21">Judges 5:21</span>) it is spoken of as “that ancient river,” either (1) because it had flowed on for ages, or (2), according to the Targum, because it was “the torrent in which were shown signs and wonders to Israel of old;” or (3) probably the reference is to the exploits in that region among the ancient Canaanites, for the adjoining plain of Esdraelon was the great battle-field of Palestine.<br>This was the scene of the defeat of Sisera (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_7,13">Judges 4:7, 13</span>), and of the destruction of the prophets of Baal by Elijah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_40"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_40">1 Kings 18:40</span></span>). “When the Kishon was at its height, it would be, partly on account of its quicksands, as impassable as the ocean itself to a retreating army.” (See DEBORAH.)
