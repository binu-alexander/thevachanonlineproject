The Egyptians were specially skilled in it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS19_9">Isaiah 19:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_7">Ezekiel 27:7</span>), and some have regarded them as its inventors.<br>In the wilderness, the Hebrews practised it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_1,8">Exodus 26:1, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_4,39">28:4, 39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_47">Leviticus 13:47</span>). It is referred to in subsequent times as specially the women’s work (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_7">2 Kings 23:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_13,24">Proverbs 31:13, 24</span>). No mention of the loom is found in Scripture, but we read of the “shuttle” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB7_6">Job 7:6</span>), “the pin” of the beam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_14">Judges 16:14</span>), “the web” (13, 14), and “the beam” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_7">1 Samuel 17:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_19">2 Samuel 21:19</span>). The rendering, “with pining sickness,” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS38_12">Isaiah 38:12</span> (A.V.) should be, as in the Revised Version, “from the loom,” or, as in the margin, “from the thrum.” We read also of the “warp” and“woof” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_48,49,51-53,58,59">Leviticus 13:48, 49, 51-53, 58, 59</span>), but the Revised Version margin has, instead of “warp,” “woven or knitted stuff.”
