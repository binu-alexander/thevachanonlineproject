It was God’s purpose thus to perpetuate his revealed will. From time to time he raised up men to commit to writing in an infallible record the revelation he gave. The “Scripture,” or collection of sacred writings, was thus enlarged from time to time as God saw necessary. We have now a completed “Scripture,” consisting of the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament canon in the time of our Lord was precisely the same as that which we now possess under that name. He placed the seal of his own authority on this collection of writings, as all equally given by inspiration (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_17">Matthew 5:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_12">7:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_40">22:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_29,31">Luke 16:29, 31</span>).<br>(See BIBLE; CANON.)
