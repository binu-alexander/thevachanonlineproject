In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_2">Acts 20:2</span> it designates only the Roman province of Macedonia. Greece was conquered by the Romans B.C. 146.<br>After passing through various changes it was erected into an independent monarchy in 1831.<br>Moses makes mention of Greece under the name of Javan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_2-5">Genesis 10:2-5</span>); and this name does not again occur in the Old Testament till the time of Joel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_6">3:6</span>). Then the Greeks and Hebrews first came into contact in the Tyrian slave-market. Prophetic notice is taken of Greece in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_21">Daniel 8:21</span>.<br>The cities of Greece were the special scenes of the labours of the apostle Paul.<br>
