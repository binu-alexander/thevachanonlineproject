He was the brother of Joab and Asahel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_18">2 Samuel 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_16">1 Chronicles 2:16</span>). Abishai was the only one who accompanied David when he went to the camp of Saul and took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_5-12">1 Samuel 26:5-12</span>). He had the command of one of the three divisions of David’s army at the battle with Absalom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_2,5,12">2 Samuel 18:2,5,12</span>). He slew the Philistine giant Ishbi-benob, who threatened David’s life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_15-17">2 Samuel 21:15-17</span>). He was the chief of the second rank of the three “mighties” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_18,19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_18">2 Samuel 23:18</span>, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R111_20,21">1 Chronicles 11:20,21</span>); and on one occasion withstood 300 men, and slew them with his own spear (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_18">2 Samuel 23:18</span>). Abishai is the name of the Semitic chief who offers gifts to the Lord of Beni-Hassan. See illustration facing page 10.<br>
