Their common fuel was dried dung of animals and wood charcoal. Two different words are found in Hebrew to denote coal, both occurring in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR26_21">Proverbs 26:21</span>, “As coal[Hebrews peham; i.e., “black coal”] is to burning coal [Hebrews gehalim].” The latter of these words is used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB41_21">Job 41:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR6_28">Proverbs 6:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_19">Isaiah 44:19</span>.<br>The words “live coal” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS6_6">Isaiah 6:6</span> are more correctly “glowing stone.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM4_8">Lamentations 4:8</span> the expression “blacker than a coal” is literally rendered in the margin of the Revised Version “darker than blackness.” “Coals of fire” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S222_9,13">2 Samuel 22:9, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_8,12,13">Psalm 18:8, 12, 13</span>, etc.) is an expression used metaphorically for lightnings proceeding from God. A false tongue is compared to “coals of juniper” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS120_4">Psalm 120:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM3_6">James 3:6</span>). “Heaping coals of fire on the head” symbolizes overcoming evil with good. The words of Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM12_20">Romans 12:20</span>) are equivalent to saying, “By charity and kindness thou shalt soften down his enmity as surely as heaping coals on the fire fuses the metal in the crucible.”
