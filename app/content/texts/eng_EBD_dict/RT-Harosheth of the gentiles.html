It was here that Jabin’s great army was marshalled before it went forth into the great battlefield of Esdraelon to encounter the army of Israel, by which it was routed and put to flight (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_">Judges 4</span>). It was situated“at the entrance of the pass to Esdraelon from the plain of Acre” at the base of Carmel. The name in the Hebrew is Harosheth ha Gojim, i.e., “the smithy of the nations;” probably, as is supposed, so called because here Jabin’s iron war-chariots, armed with scythes, were made. It is identified with el-Harithiyeh.<br>
