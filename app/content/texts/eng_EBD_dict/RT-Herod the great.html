In the year B.C. 47 Julius Caesar made Antipater, a “wily Idumaean,” procurator of Judea, who divided his territories between his four sons, Galilee falling to the lot of Herod, who was afterwards appointed tetrarch of Judea by Mark Antony (B.C. 40), and also king of Judea by the Roman senate.<br>He was of a stern and cruel disposition. “He was brutish and a stranger to all humanity.” Alarmed by the tidings of one “born King of the Jews,” he sent forth and “slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_16">Matthew 2:16</span>). He was fond of splendour, and lavished great sums in rebuilding and adorning the cities of his empire. He rebuilt the city of Caesarea (q.v.) on the coast, and also the city of Samaria (q.v.), which he called Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. He restored the ruined temple of Jerusalem, a work which was begun B.C. 20, but was not finished till after Herod’s death, probably not till about A.D. 50 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN2_20">John 2:20</span>). After a troubled reign of thirty-seven years, he died at Jericho amid great agonies both of body and mind, B.C. 4, i.e., according to the common chronology, in the year in which Jesus was born.<br>After his death his kingdom was divided among three of his sons. Of these, Philip had the land east of Jordan, between Caesarea Philippi and Bethabara, Antipas had Galilee and Peraea, while Archelaus had Judea and Samaria.<br>GENEALOGICAL TABLE OF THE HERODIAN FAMILY HEROD THE GREAT (Matt. 2:1) married|—————————————————————————— | | | | MARIAMNE, the Asmonean MARIAMNE MALTHACE CLEOPATRA grand-daughter of daughter of Simon, a Samaritan of Jerusalem John Hyrcanus a high preist | || | | | | ARISTOBULUS HEROD PHILIP I.
