His full name was Publius Sulpicius Quirinus. Recent historical investigation has proved that Quirinus was governor of Cilicia, which was annexed to Syria at the time of our Lord’s birth. Cilicia, which he ruled, being a province of Syria, he is called the governor, which he was de jure, of Syria. Some ten years afterwards he was appointed governor of Syria for the second time. During his tenure of office, at the time of our Lord’s birth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_2">Luke 2:2</span>), a “taxing”(R.V., “enrolment;” i.e., a registration) of the people was “first made;” i.e., was made for the first time under his government. (See TAXING.)
