Hebrews ‘aroth, properly green herbage growing in marshy places.<br>(2.) Hebrews kaneh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_15">1 Kings 14:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB40_21">Job 40:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS19_6">Isaiah 19:6</span>), whence the Gr. kanna, a “cane,” a generic name for a reed of any kind.<br>The reed of Egypt and Palestine is the Arundo donax, which grows to the height of 12 feet, its stalk jointed like the bamboo, “with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position.” It is used to illustrate weakness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_21">2 Kings 18:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_6">Ezekiel 29:6</span>), also fickleness or instability (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_7">Matthew 11:7</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_14">Ephesians 4:14</span>).<br>A “bruised reed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_3">Isaiah 42:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_20">Matthew 12:20</span>) is an emblem of a believer weak in grace. A reed was put into our Lord’s hands in derision (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_29">Matthew 27:29</span>); and “they took the reed and smote him on the head” (30). The“reed” on which they put the sponge filled with vinegar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_48">Matthew 27:48</span>) was, according to John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_29">19:29</span>), a hyssop stalk, which must have been of some length, or perhaps a bunch of hyssop twigs fastened to a rod with the sponge. (See CANE.)
