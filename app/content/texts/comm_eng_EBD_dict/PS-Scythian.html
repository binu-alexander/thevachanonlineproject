Of this vast country but little was anciently known.<br>Its modern representative is Russia, which, to a great extent, includes the same territories.” They were the descendants of Japheth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_27">Genesis 9:27</span>). It appears that in apostolic times there were some of this people that embraced Christianity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_11">Colossians 3:11</span>).<br>
