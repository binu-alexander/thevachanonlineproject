Hebrew yathed, “piercing,” a peg or nail of any material (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK15_3">Ezekiel 15:3</span>), more especially a tent-peg (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_19">Exodus 27:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_18">35:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX38_20">38:20</span>), with one of which Jael (q.v.) pierced the temples of Sisera (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_21,22">Judges 4:21, 22</span>). This word is also used metaphorically (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC10_4">Zechariah 10:4</span>) for a prince or counsellor, just as “the battle-bow” represents a warrior.<br>(2.) Masmer, a “point,” the usual word for a nail. The words of the wise are compared to “nails fastened by the masters of assemblies”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_11">Ecclesiastes 12:11</span>, A.V.). The Revised Version reads, “as nails well fastened are the words of the masters,” etc. Others (as Plumptre) read, “as nails fastened are the masters of assemblies” (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_23">Isaiah 22:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER9_8">Ezra 9:8</span>). David prepared nails for the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_3">1 Chronicles 22:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R23_9">2 Chronicles 3:9</span>). The nails by which our Lord was fixed to the cross are mentioned(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_25">John 20:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_14">Colossians 2:14</span>).<br>Nail of the finger (Hebrews tsipporen, “scraping”). To “pare the nails” is in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_12">Deuteronomy 21:12</span> (marg., “make,” or “dress,” or “suffer to grow”) one of the signs of purification, separation from former heathenism (comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV14_8">Leviticus 14:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU8_7">Numbers 8:7</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR17_1">Jeremiah 17:1</span> this word is rendered“point.”
