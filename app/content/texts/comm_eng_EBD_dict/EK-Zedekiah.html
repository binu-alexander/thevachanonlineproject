The last king of Judah. He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_31">2 Kings 23:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_17,18">24:17, 18</span>). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet “he did evil in the sight of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_19,20">2 Kings 24:19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_2,3">Jeremiah 52:2, 3</span>). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years.<br>The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, “with all his host” (2 King 25:1), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, “every worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God’s fury to the dregs” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_3">2 Kings 25:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM4_4,5,10">Lamentations 4:4, 5, 10</span>). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah.<br>There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_1-7">2 Kings 25:1-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R236_12">2 Chronicles 36:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_4,5">Jeremiah 32:4,5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR34_2,3">34:2, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_1-7">39:1-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_4-11">52:4-11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK12_12">Ezekiel 12:12</span>), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.<br>After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_16">Jeremiah 52:16</span>). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_22,24">2 Kings 25:22, 24</span>; jer. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K240_1,2,5,6">40:1, 2, 5, 6</span>).<br>(2.) The son of Chenaanah, a false prophet in the days of Ahab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_11,24">1 Kings 22:11, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R218_10,23">2 Chronicles 18:10, 23</span>).<br>(3.) The son of Hananiah, a prince of Judah in the days of Jehoiakim(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_12">Jeremiah 36:12</span>).<br>
