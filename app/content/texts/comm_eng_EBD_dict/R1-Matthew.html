He was the son of Alphaeus, and was a publican or tax-gatherer at Capernaum. On one occasion Jesus, coming up from the side of the lake, passed the custom-house where Matthew was seated, and said to him, “Follow me.” Matthew arose and followed him, and became his disciple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_9">Matthew 9:9</span>).<br>Formerly the name by which he was known was Levi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK2_14">Mark 2:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_27">Luke 5:27</span>); he now changed it, possibly in grateful memory of his call, to Matthew. The same day on which Jesus called him he made a “great feast”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_29">Luke 5:29</span>), a farewell feast, to which he invited Jesus and his disciples, and probably also many of old associates. He was afterwards selected as one of the twelve (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_15">6:15</span>). His name does not occur again in the Gospel history except in the lists of the apostles. The last notice of him is in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_13">Acts 1:13</span>. The time and manner of his death are unknown.<br>
