This plant was cultivated from earliest times. The flax of Egypt was destroyed by the plague of hail when it “was bolled”, i.e., was forming pods for seed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_31">Exodus 9:31</span>). It was extensively cultivated both in Egypt and Palestine. Reference is made in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS2_6">Joshua 2:6</span> to the custom of drying flax-stalks by exposing them to the sun on the flat roofs of houses. It was much used in forming articles of clothing such as girdles, also cords and bands (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_48,52,59">Leviticus 13:48, 52, 59</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11">Deuteronomy 22:11</span>).
