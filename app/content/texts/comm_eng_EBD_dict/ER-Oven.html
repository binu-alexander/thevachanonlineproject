In towns there appear to have been public ovens. There was a street in Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR37_21">Jeremiah 37:21</span>) called“bakers’ street” (the only case in which the name of a street in Jerusalem is preserved). The words “tower of the furnaces” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_11">Nehemiah 3:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_38">12:38</span>) is more properly “tower of the ovens” (Hebrews tannurim). These resemble the ovens in use among ourselves.<br>There were other private ovens of different kinds. Some were like large jars made of earthenware or copper, which were heated inside with wood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_12">1 Kings 17:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_15">Isaiah 44:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR7_18">Jeremiah 7:18</span>) or grass (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_30">Matthew 6:30</span>), and when the fire had burned out, small pieces of dough were placed inside or spread in thin layers on the outside, and were thus baked. (See FURNACE.) Pits were also formed for the same purposes, and lined with cement. These were used after the same manner.<br>Heated stones, or sand heated by a fire heaped over it, and also flat irons pans, all served as ovens for the preparation of bread. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6">Genesis 18:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_6">1 Kings 19:6</span>.)
