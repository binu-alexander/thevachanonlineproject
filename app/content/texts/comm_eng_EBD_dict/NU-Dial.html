The Hebrew word(ma’aloth) is rendered “steps” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_26,1">Exodus 20:26, 1</span> Kings 10:19, and“degrees” in 2 Kings 20:9, 10, 11. The ma’aloth was probably stairs on which the shadow of a column or obelisk placed on the top fell. The shadow would cover a greater or smaller number of steps, according as the sun was low or high.<br>Probably the sun-dial was a Babylonian invention. Daniel at Babylon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_6">Daniel 3:6</span>) is the first to make mention of the “hour.”
