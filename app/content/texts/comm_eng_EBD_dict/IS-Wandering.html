They wandered for forty years before they were permitted to cross the Jordan(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS4_19">Joshua 4:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_6">5:6</span>).<br>The record of these wanderings is given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU33_1-49">Numbers 33:1-49</span>. Many of the stations at which they camped cannot now be identified.<br>Questions of an intricate nature have been discussed regarding the“Wanderings,” but it is enough for us to take the sacred narrative as it stands, and rest assured that “He led them forth by the right way” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS107_1-7,33-35">Psalm 107:1-7, 33-35</span>).
