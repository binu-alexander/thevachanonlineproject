Common in Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_5">Numbers 20:5</span>) and Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_23">13:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_8">Deuteronomy 8:8</span>). The Romans called it Punicum malum, i.e., Carthaginian apple, because they received it from Carthage. It belongs to the myrtle family of trees. The withering of the pomegranate tree is mentioned among the judgments of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JL1_12">Joel 1:12</span>). It is frequently mentioned in the Song of Solomon (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL4_3,13">4:3, 13</span>, etc.). The skirt of the high priest’s blue robe and ephod was adorned with the representation of pomegranates, alternating with golden bells (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_33,34">Exodus 28:33,34</span>), as also were the “chapiters upon the two pillars” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_20">1 Kings 7:20</span>) which “stood before the house.”
