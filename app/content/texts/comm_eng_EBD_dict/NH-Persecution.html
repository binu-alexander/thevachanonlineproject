Ahab’s example in this respect was followed by Manasseh, who “shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_16">2 Kings 21:16</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_4">24:4</span>). In all ages, in one form or another, the people of God have had to suffer persecution. In its earliest history the Christian church passed through many bloody persecutions. Of subsequent centuries in our own and in other lands the same sad record may be made.<br>Christians are forbidden to seek the propagation of the gospel by force(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_1">Matthew 7:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_54-56">Luke 9:54-56</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM14_4">Romans 14:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM4_11,12">James 4:11, 12</span>). The words of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS7_13">Psalm 7:13</span>, “He ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors,” ought rather to be, as in the Revised Version, “He maketh his arrows fiery[shafts].”
