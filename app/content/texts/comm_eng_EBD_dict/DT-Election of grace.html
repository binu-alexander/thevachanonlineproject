(2) There is also an election of nations to special privileges, e.g., the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_6">Deuteronomy 7:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_4">Romans 9:4</span>). (3) But in addition there is an election of individuals to eternal life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_4">Ephesians 1:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_2">1 Peter 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN13_18">John 13:18</span>).<br>The ground of this election to salvation is the good pleasure of God(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_5,11">Ephesians 1:5, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_25,26">Matthew 11:25, 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN15_16,19">John 15:16, 19</span>). God claims the right so to do (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_16,21">Romans 9:16, 21</span>).<br>It is not conditioned on faith or repentance, but is of soverign grace(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_4-6">Romans 11:4-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_3-6">Ephesians 1:3-6</span>). All that pertain to salvation, the means(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_8">Ephesians 2:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span></span></span>) as well as the end, are of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC5_31">Acts 5:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T22_25">2 Timothy 2:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C11_30">1 Corinthians 1:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_5,10">Ephesians 2:5, 10</span>). Faith and repentance and all other graces are the exercises of a regenerated soul; and regeneration is God’s work, a “new creature.” Men are elected “to salvation,” “to the adoption of sons,” “to be holy and without blame before him in love” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="H22_13">2 Thessalonians 2:13</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_4,5">Galatians 4:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_4">Ephesians 1:4</span></span>). The ultimate end of election is the praise of God’s grace(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_6,12">Ephesians 1:6, 12</span>). (See PREDESTINATION.)
