At the end of seven years all debts were remitted. Of a foreigner the loan might, however, be exacted. At a later period of the Hebrew commonwealth, when commerce increased, the practice of exacting usury or interest on loans, and of suretiship in the commercial sense, grew up. Yet the exaction of it from a Hebrew was regarded as discreditable (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS15_5">Psalm 15:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR6_1,4">Proverbs 6:1, 4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR11_15">11:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR17_18">17:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR20_16">20:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR27_13">27:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR15_10">Jeremiah 15:10</span>).<br>Limitations are prescribed by the law to the taking of a pledge from the borrower. The outer garment in which a man slept at night, if taken in pledge, was to be returned before sunset (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_26,27">Exodus 22:26, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_12,13">Deuteronomy 24:12, 13</span>). A widow’s garment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_17">Deuteronomy 24:17</span>) and a millstone (6) could not be taken. A creditor could not enter the house to reclaim a pledge, but must remain outside till the borrower brought it (10, 11). The Hebrew debtor could not be retained in bondage longer than the seventh year, or at farthest the year of jubilee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_2">Exodus 21:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_39,42">Leviticus 25:39, 42</span>), but foreign sojourners were to be “bondmen for ever” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_44-54">Leviticus 25:44-54</span>).<br>
