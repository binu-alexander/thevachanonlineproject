By their scandalous conduct they brought down a curse on their father’s house (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_22,12-27,27-36">2:22, 12-27, 27-36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S13_11-14">3:11-14</span>). For their wickedness they were called “sons of Belial,” i.e., worthless men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_12">2:12</span>).<br>They both perished in the disastrous battle with the Philistines at Aphek(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S14_11">4:11</span>).
