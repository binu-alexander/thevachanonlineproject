It is first mentioned in connection with David’s flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_30">2 Samuel 15:30</span>), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC14_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC14_4">Zechariah 14:4</span></span>. It is, however, frequently alluded to (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7">1 Kings 11:7</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13">2 Kings 23:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_15">Nehemiah 8:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK11_23"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EK11_23">Ezekiel 11:23</span></span>).<br>It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_1">Matthew 21:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_30">26:30</span>, etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., “Mount of the Summit;” also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., “Mount of Olives.” It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. “No name in Scripture,” says Dr. Porter, “calls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The‘mount’ is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_">Matthew 24</span>). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_37">Luke 21:37</span>); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, ‘O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt’(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_39">Matthew 26:39</span>). And when the cup of God’s wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_50,51">Luke 24:50, 51</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_12">Acts 1:12</span>).” This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the“Galilee” peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_11">Acts 1:11</span>); (2) the “Mount of Ascension,” the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_51,52">Luke 24:51, 52</span>); (3) the “Prophets,” from the catacombs on its side, called “the prophets’ tombs;” and (4) the “Mount of Corruption,” so called because of the “high places” erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_7">1 Kings 11:7</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13">2 Kings 23:13</span></span>; Vulg., “Mount of Offence”).<br>
