This word was used as a name of contempt as applied to our Lordâ€™s disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_59">Luke 22:59</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_7">Acts 2:7</span>). All the apostles, with the exception of Judas Iscariot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_11">Acts 1:11</span>), were Galileans. Peter was detected by his Galilean accent (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_69">Matthew 26:69</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_70">Mark 14:70</span>).<br>This was also one of the names of reproach given to the early Christians.<br>Julian the Apostate, as he is called, not only used the epithet himself when referring to Christ and his apostles, but he made it a law that no one should ever call the Christians by any other name.<br>
