</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Bow" ><div class="is"><b>BOW</b></div><br>"BOW" The bow was in use in early times both in war and in the chase(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_20">Genesis 21:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_3">27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN48_22">48:22</span>). The tribe of Benjamin were famous for the use of the bow (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_40">1 Chronicles <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_40">8:40</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_2">12:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R214_8">2 Chronicles 14:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R217_17">17:17</span>); so also were the Elamites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_6">Isaiah 22:6</span></span>) and the Lydians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR46_9">Jeremiah 46:9</span>). The Hebrew word commonly used for bow means properly to tread (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_18">1 Chronicles 5:18</span>; 8:40), and hence it is concluded that the foot was employed in bending the bow. Bows of steel (correctly “copper”) are mentioned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S222_35">2 Samuel 22:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_34">Psalm 18:34</span>).<br>The arrows were carried in a quiver (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_3">Genesis 27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_6">Isaiah 22:6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS49_2">49:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS127_5">Psalm 127:5</span>). They were apparently sometimes shot with some burning material attached to them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS120_4">Psalm 120:4</span>).<br>The bow is a symbol of victory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS7_12">Psalm 7:12</span>). It denotes also falsehood, deceit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS64_3,4">Psalm 64:3, 4</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS7_16">7:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR9_3">Jeremiah 9:3</span>).<br>“The use of the bow” in 2 Samuel 1:18 (A.V.) ought to be “the song of the bow,” as in the Revised Version.<br>
