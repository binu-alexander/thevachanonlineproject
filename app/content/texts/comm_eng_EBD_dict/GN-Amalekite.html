They were not the descendants of Amalek, the son of Eliphaz, for they existed in the days of Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_7">Genesis 14:7</span>). They were probably a tribe that migrated from the shores of the Persian Gulf and settled in Arabia. “They dwelt in the land of the south...from Havilah until thou comest to Shur” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_29">Numbers 13:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_7">1 Samuel 15:7</span>). They were a pastoral, and hence a nomadic race. Their kings bore the hereditary name of Agag (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_7">Numbers 24:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_8">1 Samuel 15:8</span>). They attempted to stop the Israelites when they marched through their territory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_18">Deuteronomy 25:18</span>), attacking them at Rephidim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_8-13">Exodus 17:8-13</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_17">Deuteronomy 25:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_2">1 Samuel 15:2</span>). They afterwards attacked the Israelites at Hormah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_45">Numbers 14:45</span>). We read of them subsequently as in league with the Moabites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_13">Judges 3:13</span>) and the Midianites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_3">Judges 6:3</span>). Saul finally desolated their territory and destroyed their power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_48">1 Samuel 14:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_3">15:3</span>), and David recovered booty from them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_18-20">1 Samuel 30:18-20</span>). In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called Sute, in those of Egypt Sittiu, and the Amarna tablets include them under the general name of Khabbati, or“plunderers.”
