Under the Mosaic law non-Israelites, with the exception of the Moabites and the Ammonites and others mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_1-3">Deuteronomy 23:1-3</span>, were admitted to the general privileges of citizenship among the Jews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19">Exodus 12:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_22">Leviticus 24:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_15">Numbers 15:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_15">35:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT10_18">Deuteronomy 10:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_29">14:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_10,14">16:10, 14</span>).<br>The right of citizenship under the Roman government was granted by the emperor to individuals, and sometimes to provinces, as a favour or as a recompense for services rendered to the state, or for a sum of money (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_28">Acts 22:28</span>). This “freedom” secured privileges equal to those enjoyed by natives of Rome. Among the most notable of these was the provision that a man could not be bound or imprisoned without a formal trial (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_25,26">Acts 22:25, 26</span>), or scourged (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_37">16:37</span>). All Roman citizens had the right of appeal to Caesar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC25_11">25:11</span>).<br>
