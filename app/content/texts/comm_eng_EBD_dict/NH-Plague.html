Sent as a divine chastisement(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_33">Numbers 11:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_37">14:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU16_46-49">16:46-49</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_21">2 Samuel 24:21</span>). Painful afflictions or diseases, (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_3,5,30">Leviticus 13:3, 5, 30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_37">1 Kings 8:37</span>), or severe calamity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_29">Mark 5:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_21">Luke 7:21</span>), or the judgment of God, so called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_14">Exodus 9:14</span>). Plagues of Egypt were ten in number.<br>(1.) The river Nile was turned into blood, and the fish died, and the river stank, so that the Egyptians loathed to drink of the river (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX7_14-25">Exodus 7:14-25</span>).<br>(2.) The plague of frogs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_1-15">Exodus 8:1-15</span>).<br>(3.) The plague of lice (Hebrews kinnim, properly gnats or mosquitoes; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_45">Psalm 78:45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_31">105:31</span>), “out of the dust of the land” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_16-19">Exodus 8:16-19</span>).<br>(4.) The plague of flies (Hebrews arob, rendered by the LXX. dog-fly), <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_21-24">Exodus 8:21-24</span>.<br>(5.) The murrain (Ex.<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_1-7">9:1-7</span>), or epidemic pestilence which carried off vast numbers of cattle in the field. Warning was given of its coming.<br>(6.) The sixth plague, of “boils and blains,” like the third, was sent without warning (Ex.<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_8-12">9:8-12</span>). It is called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_27">Deuteronomy 28:27</span>) “the botch of Egypt,” A.V.; but in R.V., “the boil of Egypt.” “The magicians could not stand before Moses” because of it.<br>(7.) The plague of hail, with fire and thunder (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_13-33">Exodus 9:13-33</span>). Warning was given of its coming. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_13">Psalm 18:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_32,33">105:32, 33</span>).<br>(8.) The plague of locusts, which covered the whole face of the earth, so that the land was darkened with them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX10_12-15">Exodus 10:12-15</span>). The Hebrew name of this insect, arbeh, points to the “multitudinous” character of this visitation. Warning was given before this plague came.<br>(9.) After a short interval the plague of darkness succeeded that of the locusts; and it came without any special warning (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX10_21-29">Exodus 10:21-29</span>). The darkness covered “all the land of Egypt” to such an extent that “they saw not one another.” It did not, however, extend to the land of Goshen.<br>(10.) The last and most fearful of these plagues was the death of the first-born of man and of beast (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX11_4,5">Exodus 11:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_29,30">12:29,30</span>). The exact time of the visitation was announced, “about midnight”, which would add to the horror of the infliction. Its extent also is specified, from the first-born of the king to the first-born of the humblest slave, and all the first-born of beasts. But from this plague the Hebrews were completely exempted. The Lord “put a difference” between them and the Egyptians. (See PASSOVER.)
