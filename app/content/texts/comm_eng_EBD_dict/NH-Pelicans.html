The pelican is ranked among unclean birds (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_18">Leviticus 11:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_17">Deuteronomy 14:17</span>). It is of an enormous size, being about 6 feet long, with wings stretching out over 12 feet. The Hebrew name (kaath, i.e.,“vomiter”) of this bird is incorrectly rendered “cormorant” in the Authorized Version of <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS34_11">Isaiah 34:11</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_14">Zephaniah 2:14</span>, but correctly in the Revised Version. It receives its Hebrew name from its habit of storing in its pouch large quantities of fish, which it disgorges when it feeds its young. Two species are found on the Syrian coast, the Pelicanus onocrotalus, or white pelican, and the Pelicanus crispus, or Dalmatian pelican.<br>
