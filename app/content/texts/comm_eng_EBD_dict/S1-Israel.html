This is the common name given to Jacob’s descendants. The whole people of the twelve tribes are called “Israelites,” the “children of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS3_17">Joshua 3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_25">7:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_27">Judges 8:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR3_21">Jeremiah 3:21</span>), and the “house of Israel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_31">Exodus 16:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_38">40:38</span>).<br>This name Israel is sometimes used emphatically for the true Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS73_1">Psalm 73:1</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS45_17">Isaiah 45:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS49_3">49:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_47">John 1:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_6">Romans 9:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_26">11:26</span>).<br>After the death of Saul the ten tribes arrogated to themselves this name, as if they were the whole nation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_9,10,17,28">2 Samuel 2:9, 10, 17, 28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_10,17">3:10, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_40-43">19:40-43</span>), and the kings of the ten tribes were called “kings of Israel,” while the kings of the two tribes were called “kings of Judah.” After the Exile the name Israel was assumed as designating the entire nation.<br>
