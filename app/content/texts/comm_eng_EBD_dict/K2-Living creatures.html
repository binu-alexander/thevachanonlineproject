They are distinguished from angels(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV15_7">Revelation 15:7</span>); they join the elders in the “new song” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV5_8,9">5:8, 9</span>); they warn of danger from divine justice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS6_3-5">Isaiah 6:3-5</span>), and deliver the commission to those who execute it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK10_2,7">Ezekiel 10:2, 7</span>); they associate with the elders in their sympathy with the hundred and forty-four thousand who sing the new song (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV14_3">Revelation 14:3</span>), and with the Church in the overthrow of her enemies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV19_4">19:4</span>).<br>They are supposed to represent mercy, as distinguished from justice, mercy in its various instrumentalities, and especially as connected with the throne of God, the “throne of grace.”
