(1.) Hebrews mahsom’ signifies a muzzle or halter or bridle, by which the rider governs his horse (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS39_1">Psalm 39:1</span>).<br>(2.) Me’theg, rendered also “bit” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS32_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS32_9">Psalm 32:9</span></span>, which is its proper meaning. Found in 2 Kings 19:28, where the restraints of God’s providence are metaphorically styled his “bridle” and “hook.” God’s placing a “bridle in the jaws of the people” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_28"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_28">Isaiah 30:28</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_29">37:29</span>) signifies his preventing the Assyrians from carrying out their purpose against Jerusalem.<br>(3.) Another word, re’sen, was employed to represent a halter or bridle-rein, as used <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS32_9"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS32_9">Psalm 32:9</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_28"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_28">Isaiah 30:28</span></span>. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB30_11">Job 30:11</span> the restraints of law and humanity are called a bridle.<br>
