All meat-offerings were seasoned with salt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_13">Leviticus 2:13</span>). To eat salt with one is to partake of his hospitality, to derive subsistence from him; and hence he who did so was bound to look after his host’s interests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER4_14">Ezra 4:14</span>, “We have maintenance from the king’s palace;” A.V. marg., “We are salted with the salt of the palace;” R.V., “We eat the salt of the palace”).<br>A “covenant of salt” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_19">Numbers 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R213_5">2 Chronicles 13:5</span>) was a covenant of perpetual obligation. New-born children were rubbed with salt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_4">Ezekiel 16:4</span>). Disciples are likened unto salt, with reference to its cleansing and preserving uses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13">Matthew 5:13</span></span>). When Abimelech took the city of Shechem, he sowed the place with salt, that it might always remain a barren soil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_45">Judges 9:45</span>). Sir Lyon Playfair argues, on scientific grounds, that under the generic name of “salt,” in certain passages, we are to understand petroleum or its residue asphalt. Thus in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_26">Genesis 19:26</span> he would read “pillar of asphalt;” and in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13">Matthew 5:13</span></span>, instead of “salt,”“petroleum,” which loses its essence by exposure, as salt does not, and becomes asphalt, with which pavements were made.<br>The Jebel Usdum, to the south of the Dead Sea, is a mountain of rock salt about 7 miles long and from 2 to 3 miles wide and some hundreds of feet high.<br>
