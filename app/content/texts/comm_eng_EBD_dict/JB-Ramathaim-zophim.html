Ramathaim is another name for Ramah (4).<br>One of the Levitical families descended from Kohath, that of Zuph or Zophai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_26,35">1 Chronicles 6:26, 35</span>), had a district assigned to them in Ephraim, which from this circumstance was called “the land of Zuph,” and hence the name of the town, “Zophim.” It was the birth-place of Samuel and the seat of his authority (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_11">1 Samuel 2:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_17">7:17</span>). It is frequently mentioned in the history of that prophet and of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_34">15:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_13">16:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_18-23">19:18-23</span>). Here Samuel died and was buried (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_1">25:1</span>).<br>This town has been identified with the modern Neby Samwil (“the prophet Samuel”), about 4 or 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem. But there is no certainty as to its precise locality. Some have supposed that it may be identical with Arimathea of the New Testament. (See MIZPAH).<br>
