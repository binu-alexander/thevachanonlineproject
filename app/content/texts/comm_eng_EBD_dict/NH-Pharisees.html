The first mention of them is in a description by Josephus of the three sects or schools into which the Jews were divided(B.C. 145). The other two sects were the Essenes and the Sadducees. In the time of our Lord they were the popular party (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_48">John 7:48</span>). They were extremely accurate and minute in all matters appertaining to the law of Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_14">Matthew 9:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_15">23:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK11_39">Luke 11:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_12">18:12</span>). Paul, when brought before the council of Jerusalem, professed himself a Pharisee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_6-8">Acts 23:6-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC26_4,5">26:4, 5</span>).<br>There was much that was sound in their creed, yet their system of religion was a form and nothing more. Theirs was a very lax morality (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_20">Matthew 5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_4,8">15:4, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_3,14,23,25">23:3, 14, 23, 25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_7">John 8:7</span>). On the first notice of them in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_7">Matthew 3:7</span>), they are ranked by our Lord with the Sadducees as a “generation of vipers.” They were noted for their self-righteousness and their pride (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_11">Matthew 9:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_39">Luke 7:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK18_11,12">18:11, 12</span>).<br>They were frequently rebuked by our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_39">Matthew 12:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_1-4">16:1-4</span>).<br>From the very beginning of his ministry the Pharisees showed themselves bitter and persistent enemies of our Lord. They could not bear his doctrines, and they sought by every means to destroy his influence among the people.<br>
