Achish, the king, assigned him Ziklag as his place of residence. There he dwelt for over a year and four months. From this time it pertained to the kings of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_6">1 Samuel 27:6</span>). During his absence with his army to join the Philistine expedition against the Israelites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S129_11">29:11</span>), it was destroyed by the Amalekites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_1,2">30:1, 2</span>), whom David, however, pursued and utterly routed, returning all the captives (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_26-31">1 Samuel 30:26-31</span>).<br>Two days after his return from this expedition, David received tidings of the disastrous battle of Gilboa and of the death of Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_1-16">2 Samuel 1:1-16</span>).<br>He now left Ziklag and returned to Hebron, along with his two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and his band of 600 men. It has been identified withâ€˜Asluj, a heap of ruins south of Beersheba. Conder, however, identifies it with Khirbet Zuheilikah, ruins found on three hills half a mile apart, some seventeen miles north-west of Beersheba, on the confines of Philistia, Judah, and Amalek.<br>
