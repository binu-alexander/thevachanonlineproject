It is called “the fast” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_9">Acts 27:9</span>).<br>The only other mention of a periodical fast in the Old Testament is in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_1-7">Zechariah 7:1-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC8_19">8:19</span>, from which it appears that during their captivity the Jews observed four annual fasts.<br>(1.) The fast of the fourth month, kept on the seventeenth day of Tammuz, the anniversary of the capture of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans; to commemorate also the incident recorded <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_19">Exodus 32:19</span>. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_6,7">Jeremiah 52:6, 7</span>.)(2.) The fast of the fifth month, kept on the ninth of Ab (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_27">Numbers 14:27</span>), to commemorate the burning of the city and temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_12,13">Jeremiah 52:12, 13</span>).<br>(3.) The fast of the seventh month, kept on the third of Tisri (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_">2 Kings 25</span>), the anniversary of the murder of Gedaliah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_1,2">Jeremiah 41:1, 2</span>).<br>(4.) The fast of the tenth month (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_4">Jeremiah 52:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK33_21">Ezekiel 33:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_">2 Kings 25</span>:1), to commemorate the beginning of the siege of the holy city by Nebuchadnezzar.<br>There was in addition to these the fast appointed by Esther (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_16">4:16</span>).<br>Public national fasts on account of sin or to supplicate divine favour were sometimes held. (1.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_6">1 Samuel 7:6</span>; (2.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_3">2 Chronicles 20:3</span>; (3.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_6-10">Jeremiah 36:6-10</span>; (4.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH9_1">Nehemiah 9:1</span>.<br>There were also local fasts. (1.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_26">Judges 20:26</span>; (2.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_12">2 Samuel 1:12</span>; (3.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="S131_13">1 Samuel 31:13</span>; (4.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_9-12">1 Kings 21:9-12</span>; (5.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER8_21-23">Ezra 8:21-23</span>: (6.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="JH3_5-9">Jonah 3:5-9</span>.<br>There are many instances of private occasional fasting (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_7">1 Samuel 1:7</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="S120_34">20:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_35">2 Samuel 3:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_16">12:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_27">1 Kings 21:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER10_6">Ezra 10:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH1_4">Nehemiah 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN10_2,3">Daniel 10:2,3</span>). Moses fasted forty days (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_18">Exodus 24:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_28">34:28</span>), and so also did Elijah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_8">1 Kings 19:8</span>). Our Lord fasted forty days in the wilderness(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_2">Matthew 4:2</span>).<br>In the lapse of time the practice of fasting was lamentably abused (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS58_4">Isaiah 58:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_12">Jeremiah 14:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC7_5">Zechariah 7:5</span>). Our Lord rebuked the Pharisees for their hypocritical pretences in fasting (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_16">Matthew 6:16</span>). He himself appointed no fast. The early Christians, however, observed the ordinary fasts according to the law of their fathers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_3">Acts 13:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC14_23">14:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C26_5">2 Corinthians 6:5</span>).<br>
