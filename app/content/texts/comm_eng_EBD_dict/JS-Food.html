The use of animal food was probably not unknown to the antediluvians. There is, however, a distinct law on the subject given to Noah after the Deluge(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_2-5">Genesis 9:2-5</span>). Various articles of food used in the patriarchal age are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6-8">Genesis 18:6-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_34">25:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_3,4">27:3, 4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_11">43:11</span>. Regarding the food of the Israelites in Egypt, see <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_3">Exodus 16:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_5">Numbers 11:5</span>. In the wilderness their ordinary food was miraculously supplied in the manna. They had also quails (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_11-13">Exodus 16:11-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_31">Numbers 11:31</span>).<br>In the law of Moses there are special regulations as to the animals to be used for food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_">Leviticus 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_3-21">Deuteronomy 14:3-21</span>). The Jews were also forbidden to use as food anything that had been consecrated to idols(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_15">Exodus 34:15</span>), or animals that had died of disease or had been torn by wild beasts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_31">Exodus 22:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV22_8">Leviticus <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV22_8">22:8</span></span>). (See also for other restrictions <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_19">Exodus 23:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_13-22">29:13-22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV3_4-9">Leviticus 3:4-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV9_18,19">9:18, 19</span>; 22:8; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_21">Deuteronomy 14:21</span>.) But beyond these restrictions they had a large grant from God(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_26">Deuteronomy 14:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_13,14">32:13, 14</span>).<br>Food was prepared for use in various ways. The cereals were sometimes eaten without any preparation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_14">Leviticus 23:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_25">Deuteronomy 23:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_42">2 Kings 4:42</span>). Vegetables were cooked by boiling (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_30,34">Genesis 25:30, 34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_38,39">2 Kings 4:38, 39</span>), and thus also other articles of food were prepared for use(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_4">Genesis 27:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_3">Proverbs 23:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK24_10">Ezekiel 24:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_42">Luke 24:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_9">John 21:9</span>). Food was also prepared by roasting (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_8">Exodus 12:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_14">Leviticus 2:14</span>). (See COOK.)
