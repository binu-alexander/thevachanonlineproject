This rite, practised before, as some think, by divers races, was appointed by God to be the special badge of his chosen people, an abiding sign of their consecration to him. It was established as a national ordinance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_10,11">Genesis 17:10, 11</span>). In compliance with the divine command, Abraham, though ninety-nine years of age, was circumcised on the same day with Ishmael, who was thirteen years old(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_24-27">17:24-27</span>). Slaves, whether home-born or purchased, were circumcised(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_12,13">17:12, 13</span>); and all foreigners must have their males circumcised before they could enjoy the privileges of Jewish citizenship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_48">Exodus 12:48</span>).<br>During the journey through the wilderness, the practice of circumcision fell into disuse, but was resumed by the command of Joshua before they entered the Promised Land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_2-9">Joshua 5:2-9</span>). It was observed always afterwards among the tribes of israel, although it is not expressly mentioned from the time of the settlement in Canaan till the time of Christ, about 1,450 years. The Jews prided themselves in the possession of this covenant distinction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_3">Judges 14:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG15_18">15:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_6">1 Samuel 14:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_26">17:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_20">2 Samuel 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_18">Ezekiel 31:18</span>).<br>As a rite of the church it ceased when the New Testament times began(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL6_15">Galatians 6:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_11">Colossians 3:11</span>). Some Jewish Christians sought to impose it, however, on the Gentile converts; but this the apostles resolutely resisted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_1">Acts 15:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL6_12">Galatians 6:12</span>). Our Lord was circumcised, for it “became him to fulfil all righteousness,” as of the seed of Abraham, according to the flesh; and Paul “took and circumcised” Timothy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_3">Acts 16:3</span>), to avoid giving offence to the Jews. It would render Timothy’s labours more acceptable to the Jews. But Paul would by no means consent to the demand that Titus should be circumcised (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_3-5">Galatians 2:3-5</span>). The great point for which he contended was the free admission of uncircumcised Gentiles into the church. He contended successfully in behalf of Titus, even in Jerusalem.<br>In the Old Testament a spiritual idea is attached to circumcision. It was the symbol of purity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS52_1">Isaiah 52:1</span>). We read of uncircumcised lips (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_12,30">Exodus 6:12, 30</span>), ears (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR6_10">Jeremiah 6:10</span>), hearts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_41">Leviticus 26:41</span>). The fruit of a tree that is unclean is spoken of as uncircumcised (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_23">Leviticus 19:23</span>).<br>It was a sign and seal of the covenant of grace as well as of the national covenant between God and the Hebrews. (1.) It sealed the promises made to Abraham, which related to the commonwealth of Israel, national promises. (2.) But the promises made to Abraham included the promise of redemption (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_14">Galatians 3:14</span>), a promise which has come upon us. The covenant with Abraham was a dispensation or a specific form of the covenant of grace, and circumcision was a sign and seal of that covenant. It had a spiritual meaning. It signified purification of the heart, inward circumcision effected by the Spirit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT10_16">Deuteronomy 10:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT30_6">30:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK44_7">Ezekiel 44:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_51">Acts 7:51</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM2_28">Romans 2:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_11">Colossians 2:11</span>). Circumcision as a symbol shadowing forth sanctification by the Holy Spirit has now given way to the symbol of baptism (q.v.). But the truth embodied in both ordinances is ever the same, the removal of sin, the sanctifying effects of grace in the heart.<br>Under the Jewish dispensation, church and state were identical. No one could be a member of the one without also being a member of the other.<br>Circumcision was a sign and seal of membership in both. Every circumcised person bore thereby evidence that he was one of the chosen people, a member of the church of God as it then existed, and consequently also a member of the Jewish commonwealth.<br>
