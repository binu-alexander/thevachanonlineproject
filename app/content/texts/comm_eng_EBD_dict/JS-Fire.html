The sacrifices were consumed by fire(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_20">Genesis 8:20</span>). The ever-burning fire on the altar was first kindled from heaven (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_9,13">Leviticus 6:9, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV9_24">9:24</span>), and afterwards rekindled at the dedication of Solomon’s temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R27_1,3">2 Chronicles 7:1, 3</span>). The expressions “fire from heaven” and “fire of the Lord” generally denote lightning, but sometimes also the fire of the altar was so called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_18">Exodus 29:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV1_9">Leviticus 1:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_3">2:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV3_5,9">3:5, 9</span>).<br>Fire for a sacred purpose obtained otherwise than from the altar was called“strange fire” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_1,2">Leviticus 10:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_4">Numbers 3:4</span>).<br>The victims slain for sin offerings were afterwards consumed by fire outside the camp (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_12,21">Leviticus 4:12, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_30">6:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_27">16:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_11">Hebrews 13:11</span>).<br>(2.) For domestic purposes, such as baking, cooking, warmth, etc.<br>(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_22">Jeremiah 36:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_54">Mark 14:54</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_18">John 18:18</span>). But on Sabbath no fire for any domestic purpose was to be kindled (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_3">Exodus 35:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_32-36">Numbers 15:32-36</span>).<br>(3.) Punishment of death by fire was inflicted on such as were guilty of certain forms of unchastity and incest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_14">Leviticus 20:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV21_9">21:9</span>). The burning of captives in war was not unknown among the Jews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_31">2 Samuel 12:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR29_22">Jeremiah 29:22</span>). The bodies of infamous persons who were executed were also sometimes burned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_25">Joshua 7:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_16">2 Kings 23:16</span>).<br>(4.) In war, fire was used in the destruction of cities, as Jericho (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_24">Joshua 6:24</span>), Ai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS8_19">8:19</span>), Hazor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_11">11:11</span>), Laish (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_27">Judges 18:27</span>), etc. The war-chariots of the Canaanites were burnt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_6,9,13">Joshua 11:6, 9, 13</span>). The Israelites burned the images (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_26">2 Kings 10:26</span>; R.V., “pillars”) of the house of Baal. These objects of worship seem to have been of the nature of obelisks, and were sometimes evidently made of wood.<br>Torches were sometimes carried by the soldiers in battle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_16">Judges 7:16</span>).<br>(5.) Figuratively, fire is a symbol of Jehovah’s presence and the instrument of his power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_19">Exodus 14:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_1,3">Numbers 11:1, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_20">Judges 13:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_38">1 Kings 18:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K21_10,12">2 Kings 1:10, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_11">2:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS6_4">Isaiah 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK1_4">Ezekiel 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_14">Revelation 1:14</span>, etc.).<br>God’s word is also likened unto fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR23_29">Jeremiah 23:29</span>). It is referred to as an emblem of severe trials or misfortunes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC12_6">Zechariah 12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_49">Luke 12:49</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_13,15">1 Corinthians 3:13, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_7">1 Peter 1:7</span>), and of eternal punishment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_22">Matthew 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_44">Mark 9:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV14_10">Revelation 14:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV21_8">21:8</span>).<br>The influence of the Holy Ghost is likened unto fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_11">Matthew 3:11</span>). His descent was denoted by the appearance of tongues as of fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_3">Acts 2:3</span>).<br>
