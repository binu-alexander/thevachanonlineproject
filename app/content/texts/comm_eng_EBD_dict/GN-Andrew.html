He was of Bethsaida in Galilee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_44">John 1:44</span>), and was the brother of Simon Peter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_18">Matthew 4:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_2">10:2</span>). On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, “Behold the Lamb of God”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_40">John 1:40</span>); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus.<br>The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John’s imprisonment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_18">Matthew 4:18</span>, 19; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16,17">Mark 1:16, 17</span>). Very little is related of Andrew. He was one of the confidential disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN6_8">John 6:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_22">12:22</span>), and with Peter, James, and John inquired of our Lord privately regarding his future coming (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK13_3">Mark 13:3</span>). He was present at the feeding of the five thousand (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN6_9">John 6:9</span>), and he introduced the Greeks who desired to see Jesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_22">John 12:22</span>); but of his subsequent history little is known. It is noteworthy that Andrew thrice brings others to Christ, (1) Peter; (2) the lad with the loaves; and (3) certain Greeks. These incidents may be regarded as a key to his character.<br>
