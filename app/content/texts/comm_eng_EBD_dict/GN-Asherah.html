Asherim in Revised Version, instead of “grove” and“groves” of the Authorized Version. This was the name of a sensual Canaanitish goddess Astarte, the feminine of the Assyrian Ishtar. Its symbol was the stem of a tree deprived of its boughs, and rudely shaped into an image, and planted in the ground. Such religious symbols (“groves”) are frequently alluded to in Scripture (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_13">Exodus 34:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_25">Judges 6:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_6">2 Kings 23:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_33">1 Kings 16:33</span>, etc.). These images were also sometimes made of silver or of carved stone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_7">2 Kings 21:7</span>; “the graven image of Asherah,” R.V.). (See GROVE [1].).<br>
