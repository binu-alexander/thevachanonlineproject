Thus God “tempted[<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_1">Genesis 22: 1</span>; R.V., ‘did prove’] Abraham;” and afflictions are said to tempt, i.e., to try, men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_2,12">James 1:2, 12</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_2">Deuteronomy 8:2</span>), putting their faith and patience to the test. (2.) Ordinarily, however, the word means solicitation to that which is evil, and hence Satan is called “the tempter” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_3">Matthew 4:3</span>). Our Lord was in this way tempted in the wilderness. That temptation was not internal, but by a real, active, subtle being. It was not self-sought. It was submitted to as an act of obedience on his part. “Christ was led, driven. An unseen personal force bore him a certain violence is implied in the words” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_1-11">Matthew 4:1-11</span>).<br>The scene of the temptation of our Lord is generally supposed to have been the mountain of Quarantania (q.v.), “a high and precipitous wall of rock, 1,200 or 1,500 feet above the plain west of Jordan, near Jericho.” Temptation is common to all (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN12_10">Daniel 12:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC13_9">Zechariah 13:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS66_10">Psalm 66:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_31,40">Luke 22:31, 40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_17">Hebrews 11:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_12">James 1:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_7">1 Peter 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P14_12">4:12</span>). We read of the temptation of Joseph (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN39_">Genesis 39</span>), of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_">2 Samuel 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_">1 Chronicles 21</span>), of Hezekiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_31">2 Chronicles 32:31</span>), of Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN6_">Daniel 6</span>), etc.<br>So long as we are in this world we are exposed to temptations, and need ever to be on our watch against them.<br>
