This word is once used as a descriptive designation of Jesus Christ, the Sent of the Father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB3_1">Hebrews 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_21">John 20:21</span>). It is, however, generally used as designating the body of disciples to whom he intrusted the organization of his church and the dissemination of his gospel, “the twelve,” as they are called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_1-5">Matthew 10:1-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_14">Mark 3:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_7">6:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_13">Luke 6:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_1">9:1</span>). We have four lists of the apostles, one by each of the synoptic evangelists (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_2-4">Matthew 10:2-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_16">Mark 3:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_14">Luke 6:14</span>), and one in the Acts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_13">1:13</span>). No two of these lists, however, perfectly coincide.<br>Our Lord gave them the “keys of the kingdom,” and by the gift of his Spirit fitted them to be the founders and governors of his church (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_16,17,26">John 14:16, 17, 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN15_26,27">15:26, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN16_7-15">16:7-15</span>). To them, as representing his church, he gave the commission to “preach the gospel to every creature” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_18-20">Matthew 28:18-20</span>). After his ascension he communicated to them, according to his promise, supernatural gifts to qualify them for the discharge of their duties(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_4">Acts 2:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C12_16">1 Corinthians 2:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C12_7,10,13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_7">2:7</span>, 10, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_20">2 Corinthians 5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C111_2">1 Corinthians 11:2</span>). Judas Iscariot, one of “the twelve,” fell by transgression, and Matthias was substituted in his place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_21">Acts 1:21</span>). Saul of Tarsus was afterwards added to their number (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_3-20">Acts 9:3-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_4">20:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC26_15-18">26:15-18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_12">1 Timothy 1:12</span>; 2:7; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_11">2 Timothy 1:11</span>).<br>Luke has given some account of Peter, John, and the two Jameses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_2,17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_2">Acts 12:2</span>, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_13">15:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_18">21:18</span>), but beyond this we know nothing from authentic history of the rest of the original twelve. After the martyrdom of James the Greater (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_2">Acts 12:2</span>), James the Less usually resided at Jerusalem, while Paul, “the apostle of the uncircumcision,” usually travelled as a missionary among the Gentiles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_8">Galatians 2:8</span>). It was characteristic of the apostles and necessary (1) that they should have seen the Lord, and been able to testify of him and of his resurrection from personal knowledge (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN15_27">John 15:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_21">Acts 1:21</span>, 22; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C19_1">1 Corinthians 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_14,15">Acts 22:14, 15</span>). (2.) They must have been immediately called to that office by Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_13">Luke 6:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_1">Galatians 1:1</span>). (3.) It was essential that they should be infallibly inspired, and thus secured against all error and mistake in their public teaching, whether by word or by writing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_26">John 14:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN16_13">16:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H12_13">1 Thessalonians 2:13</span>).<br>(4.) Another qualification was the power of working miracles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_20">Mark 16:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_4">Acts 2:4</span>3; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C112_8-11">1 Corinthians 12:8-11</span>). The apostles therefore could have had no successors. They are the only authoritative teachers of the Christian doctrines. The office of an apostle ceased with its first holders.<br>In 2 Corinthians 8:23 and Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C12_25">2:25</span> the word “messenger” is the rendering of the same Greek word, elsewhere rendered “apostle.”
