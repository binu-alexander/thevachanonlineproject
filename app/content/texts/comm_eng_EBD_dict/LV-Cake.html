They were salted, but unleavened (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_2">Exodus 29:2</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span>:4</span></span>). In idolatrous worship thin cakes or wafers were offered “to the queen of heaven”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR7_18">Jeremiah 7:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR44_19">44:19</span>).<br>Pancakes are described in 2 Samuel 13:8, 9. Cakes mingled with oil and baked in the oven are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span>:4</span></span>, and “wafers unleavened anointed with oil,” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_2">Exodus 29:2</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV8_26">Leviticus 8:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_29">1 Chronicles 23:29</span>.<br>“Cracknels,” a kind of crisp cakes, were among the things Jeroboam directed his wife to take with her when she went to consult Ahijah the prophet at Shiloh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_3">1 Kings 14:3</span>). Such hard cakes were carried by the Gibeonites when they came to Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_5,12">9:5, 12</span>). They described their bread as “mouldy;” but the Hebrew word nikuddim, here used, ought rather to be rendered “hard as biscuit.” It is rendered “cracknels” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_3">1 Kings 14:3</span>. The ordinary bread, when kept for a few days, became dry and excessively hard. The Gibeonites pointed to this hardness of their bread as an evidence that they had come a long journey.<br>We read also of honey-cakes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_31">Exodus 16:31</span>), “cakes of figs” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_18">1 Samuel 25:18</span>), “cake” as denoting a whole piece of bread (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_12">1 Kings 17:12</span>), and “a[round] cake of barley bread” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_13">Judges 7:13</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span> is a list of the different kinds of bread and cakes which were fit for offerings.<br>
