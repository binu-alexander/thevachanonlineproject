(1.) The act of anointing was significant of consecration to a holy or sacred use; hence the anointing of the high priest(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_29">Exodus 29:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_3">Leviticus 4:3</span>) and of the sacred vessels (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_26">Exodus 30:26</span>).<br>The high priest and the king are thus called “the anointed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV4_3">Leviticus 4:3</span>, 5, 16; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_20">6:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_10">Psalm 132:10</span>). Anointing a king was equivalent to crowning him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_13">1 Samuel 16:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_4">2 Samuel 2:4</span>, etc.). Prophets were also anointed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_16">1 Kings 19:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R116_22">1 Chronicles 16:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_15">Psalm 105:15</span>). The expression, “anoint the shield” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS21_5">Isaiah 21:5</span>), refers to the custom of rubbing oil on the leather of the shield so as to make it supple and fit for use in war.<br>(2.) Anointing was also an act of hospitality (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_38,46">Luke 7:38, 46</span>). It was the custom of the Jews in like manner to anoint themselves with oil, as a means of refreshing or invigorating their bodies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_40">Deuteronomy 28:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_3">Ruth 3:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S214_2">2 Samuel 14:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_15">Psalm 104:15</span>, etc.). This custom is continued among the Arabians to the present day.<br>(3.) Oil was used also for medicinal purposes. It was applied to the sick, and also to wounds (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS109_18">Psalm 109:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_6">Isaiah 1:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_13">Mark 6:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM5_14">James 5:14</span>).<br>(4.) The bodies of the dead were sometimes anointed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_8">Mark 14:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_56">Luke 23:56</span>).<br>(5.) The promised Deliverer is twice called the “Anointed” or Messiah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS2_2">Psalm 2:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN9_25,26">Daniel 9:25, 26</span>), because he was anointed with the Holy Ghost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS61_1">Isaiah 61:1</span>), figuratively styled the “oil of gladness” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_7">Psalm 45:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_9">Hebrews 1:9</span>). Jesus of Nazareth is this anointed One (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_41">John 1:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_22">Acts 9:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_2,3">17:2, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_5,28">18:5, 28</span>), the Messiah of the Old Testament.<br>
