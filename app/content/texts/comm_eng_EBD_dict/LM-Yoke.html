Fitted on the neck of oxen for the purpose of binding to them the traces by which they might draw the plough, etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU19_2">Numbers 19:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_3">Deuteronomy 21:3</span>). It was a curved piece of wood called ’ol.<br>(2.) In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR27_2">Jeremiah 27:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR28_10,12">28:10, 12</span> the word in the Authorized Version rendered “yoke” is motah, which properly means a “staff,” or as in the Revised Version, “bar.” These words in the Hebrew are both used figuratively of severe bondage, or affliction, or subjection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_13">Leviticus 26:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_4">1 Kings 12:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS47_6">Isaiah 47:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_14">Lamentations 1:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM3_27">3:27</span>). In the New Testament the word “yoke” is also used to denote servitude (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_29,30">Matthew 11:29, 30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_10">Acts 15:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_1">Galatians 5:1</span>).<br>(3.) In 1 Samuel 11:7, 1 Kings 19:21, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_3">Job 1:3</span> the word thus translated is tzemed, which signifies a pair, two oxen yoked or coupled together, and hence in 1 Samuel 14:14 it represents as much land as a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, like the Latin jugum. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_10">Isaiah 5:10</span> this word in the plural is translated “acres.”
