In this sense the form of the word is anath(ee)ma, once in plural used in the Greek New Testament, in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_5">Luke 21:5</span>, where it is rendered “gifts.” In the LXX. the form anathema is generally used as the rendering of the Hebrew word herem, derived from a verb which means (1) to consecrate or devote; and (2) to exterminate. Any object so devoted to the Lord could not be redeemed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_14">Numbers 18:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_28,29">Leviticus 27:28, 29</span>); and hence the idea of exterminating connected with the word. The Hebrew verb (haram) is frequently used of the extermination of idolatrous nations. It had a wide range of application. The anathema or herem was a person or thing irrevocably devoted to God(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_21,28">Leviticus 27:21, 28</span>); and “none devoted shall be ransomed. He shall surely be put to death” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_29">27:29</span>). The word therefore carried the idea of devoted to destruction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_2,3">Numbers 21:2, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_17">Joshua 6:17</span>); and hence generally it meant a thing accursed. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_26">Deuteronomy 7:26</span> an idol is called a herem = anathema, a thing accursed.<br>In the New Testament this word always implies execration. In some cases an individual denounces an anathema on himself unless certain conditions are fulfilled (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_12,14,21">Acts 23:12, 14, 21</span>). “To call Jesus accursed” [anathema] (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C112_3">1 Corinthians 12:3</span>) is to pronounce him execrated or accursed. If any one preached another gospel, the apostle says, “let him be accursed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_8,9">Galatians 1:8, 9</span>); i.e., let his conduct in so doing be accounted accursed.<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_3">Romans 9:3</span>, the expression “accursed” (anathema) from Christ, i.e., excluded from fellowship or alliance with Christ, has occasioned much difficulty. The apostle here does not speak of his wish as a possible thing.<br>It is simply a vehement expression of feeling, showing how strong was his desire for the salvation of his people.<br>The anathema in 1 Corinthians 16:22 denotes simply that they who love not the Lord are rightly objects of loathing and execration to all holy beings; they are guilty of a crime that merits the severest condemnation; they are exposed to the just sentence of “everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.”
