Here the tabernacle was then standing, and here Ahimelech the priest resided. (See AHIMELECH.) From <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_28-32"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_28-32">Isaiah 10:28-32</span></span> it seems to have been near Jerusalem. It has been identified by some with el-Isawiyeh, one mile and a half to the north-east of Jerusalem. But according to <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_28-32"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_28-32">Isaiah 10:28-32</span></span> it was on the south of Geba, on the road to Jerusalem, and within sight of the city. This identification does not meet these conditions, and hence others (as Dean Stanley) think that it was the northern summit of Mount Olivet, the place where David “worshipped God” when fleeing from Absalom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_32">2 Samuel 15:32</span>), or more probably (Conder) that it was the same as Mizpeh (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_1">Judges 20:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS18_26">Joshua 18:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_16">1 Samuel 7:16</span>, at Nebi Samwil, about 5 miles north-west of Jerusalem.<br>After being supplied with the sacred loaves of showbread, and girding on the sword of Goliath, which was brought forth from behind the ephod, David fled from Nob and sought refuge at the court of Achish, the king of Gath, where he was cast into prison. (Comp. titles of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_">Psalm 34</span> and 56.)
