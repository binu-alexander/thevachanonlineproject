The “habitation of Chimham” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_17">Jeremiah 41:17</span>) was probably an inn or khan, which is the proper meaning of the Hebrew geruth, rendered “habitation”, established in later times in his possession at Bethlehem, which David gave to him as a reward for his loyalty in accompanying him to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_7">1 Kings 2:7</span>).<br>It has been supposed that, considering the stationary character of Eastern institutions, it was in the stable of this inn or caravanserai that our Saviour was born (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_7">Luke 2:7</span>).<br>
