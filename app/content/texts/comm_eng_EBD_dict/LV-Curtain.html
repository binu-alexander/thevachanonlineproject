Ten curtains, each twenty-eight cubits long and four wide, made of fine linen, also eleven made of goat’s hair, covered the tabernacle(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_1-13">Exodus 26:1-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX36_8-17">36:8-17</span>).<br>(2.) The sacred curtain, separating the holy of holies from the sanctuary, is designated by a different Hebrew word (peroketh). It is described as a“veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_31">Exodus 26:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV16_2">Leviticus 16:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_7">Numbers 18:7</span>).<br>(3.) “Stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_22">Isaiah 40:22</span>), is an expression used with reference to the veil or awning which Orientals spread for a screen over their courts in summer. According to the prophet, the heavens are spread over our heads as such an awning.
