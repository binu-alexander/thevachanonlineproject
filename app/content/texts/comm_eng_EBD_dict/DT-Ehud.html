A descendant of Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_10">1 Chronicles 7:10</span>), his great-grandson.<br>(2.) The son of Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_15">Judges 3:15</span>). After the death of Othniel the people again fell into idolatry, and Eglon, the king of Moab, uniting his bands with those of the Ammonites and the Amalekites, crossed the Jordan and took the city of Jericho, and for eighteen years held that whole district in subjection, exacting from it an annual tribute. At length Ehud, by a stratagem, put Eglon to death with a two-edged dagger a cubit long, and routed the Moabites at the fords of the Jordan, putting 10,000 of them to death. Thenceforward the land, at least Benjamin, enjoyed rest “for fourscore years” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_12-30">Judges 3:12-30</span>). (See QUARRIES [2].) But in the south-west the Philistines reduced the Israelites to great straits(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_6">Judges 5:6</span>). From this oppression Shamgar was raised up to be their deliverer.<br>
