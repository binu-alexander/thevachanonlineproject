At the time of the arrival of the Israelites in Palestine they were ruled by Adonizedek (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_1,23">Joshua 10:1, 23</span>). They were defeated by Joshua, and their king was slain; but they were not entirely driven out of Jebus till the time of David, who made it the capital of his kingdom instead of Hebron. The site on which the temple was afterwards built belonged to Araunah, a Jebusite, from whom it was purchased by David, who refused to accept it as a free gift (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_16-25">2 Samuel 24:16-25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_24,25">1 Chronicles 21:24, 25</span>).<br>
