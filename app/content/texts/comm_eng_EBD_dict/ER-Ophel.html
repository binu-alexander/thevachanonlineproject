It was surrounded by a separate wall, and was occupied by the Nethinim after the Captivity.<br>This wall has been discovered by the engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund at the south-eastern angle of the temple area. It is 4 feet below the present surface. In 2 Kings 5:24 this word is translated “tower” (R.V.,“hill”), denoting probably some eminence near Elisha’s house.<br>
