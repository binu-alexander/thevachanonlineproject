(1.) The method or scheme according to which God carries out his purposes towards men is called a dispensation. There are usually reckoned three dispensations, the Patriarchal, the Mosaic or Jewish, and the Christian.<br>(See COVENANT, Administration of.) These were so many stages in God’s unfolding of his purpose of grace toward men. The word is not found with this meaning in Scripture.<br>(2.) A commission to preach the gospel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C19_17">1 Corinthians 9:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_10">Ephesians 1:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_2">3:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_25">Colossians 1:25</span>).<br>Dispensations of Providence are providential events which affect men either in the way of mercy or of judgement.<br>
