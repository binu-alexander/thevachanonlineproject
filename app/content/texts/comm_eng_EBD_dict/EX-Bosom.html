To have in one’s bosom indicates kindness, secrecy, or intimacy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN16_5">Genesis 16:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_8">2 Samuel 12:8</span>). Christ is said to have been in “the bosom of the Father,” i.e., he had the most perfect knowledge of the Father, had the closest intimacy with him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_18">John 1:18</span>). John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN13_23">13:23</span>) was“leaning on Jesus’ bosom” at the last supper. Our Lord carries his lambs in his bosom, i.e., has a tender, watchful care over them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_11">Isaiah 40:11</span>).<br>
