A town in the plains of Judah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_34">Joshua 15:34</span>), north-west of Jerusalem, between Zanoah and Tappuah. It is the modern Umm Jina.<br>(2.) A city on the border of Machar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_21">Joshua 19:21</span>), allotted to the Gershonite Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_29">21:29</span>). It is identified with the modern Jenin, a large and prosperous town of about 4,000 inhabitants, situated 15 miles south of Mount Tabor, through which the road from Jezreel to Samaria and Jerusalem passes. When Ahaziah, king of Judah, attempted to escape from Jehu, he “fled by the way of the garden house” i.e., by way of En-gannim.<br>Here he was overtaken by Jehu and wounded in his chariot, and turned aside and fled to Megiddo, a distance of about 20 miles, to die there.<br>
