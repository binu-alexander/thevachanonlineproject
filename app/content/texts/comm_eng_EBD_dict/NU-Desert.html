Hebrews midbar, “pasture-ground;” an open tract for pasturage; a common (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_22">Joel 2:22</span>). The “backside of the desert” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_1">Exodus 3:1</span>) is the west of the desert, the region behind a man, as the east is the region in front. The same Hebrew word is rendered “wildernes,” and is used of the country lying between Egypt and Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_14,21">Genesis 21:14, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_27">Exodus 4:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_2">19:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS1_4">Joshua 1:4</span>), the wilderness of the wanderings. It was a grazing tract, where the flocks and herds of the Israelites found pasturage during the whole of their journey to the Promised Land.<br>The same Hebrew word is used also to denote the wilderness of Arabia, which in winter and early spring supplies good pasturage to the flocks of the nomad tribes than roam over it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_18">1 Kings 9:18</span>).<br>The wilderness of Judah is the mountainous region along the western shore of the Dead Sea, where David fed his father’s flocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_28">1 Samuel 17:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_2">26:2</span>). Thus in both of these instances the word denotes a country without settled inhabitants and without streams of water, but having good pasturage for cattle; a country of wandering tribes, as distinguished from that of a settled people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS35_1">Isaiah 35:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS50_2">50:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_11">Jeremiah 4:11</span>). Such, also, is the meaning of the word “wilderness” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_3">Matthew 3:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_33">15:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_4">Luke 15:4</span>.<br>(2.) The translation of the Hebrew Aribah’, “an arid tract” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS35_1">Isaiah 35:1</span>, 6; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_3">40:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS41_19">41:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_3">51:3</span>, etc.). The name Arabah is specially applied to the deep valley of the Jordan (the Ghor of the Arabs), which extends from the lake of Tiberias to the Elanitic gulf. While midbar denotes properly a pastoral region, arabah denotes a wilderness. It is also translated “plains;” as “the plains of Jericho” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_10">Joshua 5:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_5">2 Kings 25:5</span>), “the plains of Moab”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_1">Numbers 22:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_1,8">Deuteronomy 34:1, 8</span>), “the plains of the wilderness” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_16">2 Samuel 17:16</span>).<br>(3.) In the Revised Version of <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_20">Numbers 21:20</span></span> the Hebrew word jeshimon is properly rendered “desert,” meaning the waste tracts on both shores of the Dead Sea. This word is also rendered “desert” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_40">Psalm 78:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS106_14">106:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS43_19,20">Isaiah 43:19, 20</span>. It denotes a greater extent of uncultivated country than the other words so rendered. It is especially applied to the desert of the peninsula of Arabia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_20">Numbers 21:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_28">23:28</span>), the most terrible of all the deserts with which the Israelites were acquainted. It is called “the desert” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_31">Exodus 23:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT11_24">Deuteronomy 11:24</span>. (See JESHIMON.)(4.) A dry place; hence a desolation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_6">Psalm 9:6</span>), desolate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_34">Leviticus 26:34</span>); the rendering of the Hebrew word horbah’. It is rendered “desert” only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS102_6">Psalm 102:6</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS48_21">Isaiah 48:21</span>, and <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK13_4">Ezekiel 13:4</span>, where it means the wilderness of Sinai.<br>(5.) This word is the symbol of the Jewish church when they had forsaken God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_3">Isaiah 40:3</span>). Nations destitute of the knowledge of God are called a“wilderness” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS32_15">32:15</span>, midbar). It is a symbol of temptation, solitude, and persecution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS27_10">Isaiah 27:10</span>, midbar; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS33_9">33:9</span>, arabah).<br>
