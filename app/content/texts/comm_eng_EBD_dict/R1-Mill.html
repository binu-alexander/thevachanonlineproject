That used by the Hebrews consisted of two circular stones, each 2 feet in diameter and half a foot thick, the lower of which was called the “nether millstone” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB41_24">Job 41:24</span>) and the upper the “rider.” The upper stone was turned round by a stick fixed in it as a handle. There were then no public mills, and thus each family required to be provided with a hand-mill. The corn was ground daily, generally by the women of the house (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS47_1,2">Isaiah 47:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_41">Matthew 24:41</span>). It was with the upper stone of a hand-mill that “a certain woman” at Thebez broke Abimelech’s skull(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_53">Judges 9:53</span>, “a piece of a millstone;” literally, “a millstone rider”, i.e., the“runner,” the stone which revolves. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_21">2 Samuel 11:21</span>). Millstones could not be pledged (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_6">Deuteronomy 24:6</span>), as they were necessary in every family.<br>
