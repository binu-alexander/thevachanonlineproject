He was one of the disciples to whom our Lord appeared at the Sea of Tiberias after his resurrection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_2">John 21:2</span>). He was also a witness of the Ascension (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_4,12,13">Acts 1:4, 12, 13</span>). He was an“Israelite indeed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_47">John 1:47</span>).<br>
