It was assigned to the tribe of Reuben (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_16">Joshua 13:16</span>). Here was fought the great battle in which Joab defeated the Ammonites and their allies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R119_7-15">1 Chronicles 19:7-15</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_6-14">2 Samuel 10:6-14</span>). In the time of Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_2">15:2</span>) the Moabites regained possession of it from the Ammonites. (See HANUN.) The ruins of this important city, now Madeba or Madiyabah, are seen about 8 miles south-west of Heshbon, and 14 east of the Dead Sea. Among these are the ruins of what must have been a large temple, and of three cisterns of considerable extent, which are now dry. These cisterns may have originated the name Medeba, “waters of quiet.” (See OMRI.)
