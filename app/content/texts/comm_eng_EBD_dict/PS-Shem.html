He was probably the eldest of Noah’s sons. The words“brother of Japheth the elder” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_21">Genesis 10:21</span> are more correctly rendered “the elder brother of Japheth,” as in the Revised Version. Shem’s name is generally mentioned first in the list of Noah’s sons. He and his wife were saved in the ark (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_13">7:13</span>). Noah foretold his preeminence over Canaan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_23-27">9:23-27</span>). He died at the age of six hundred years, having been for many years contemporary with Abraham, according to the usual chronology. The Israelitish nation sprang from him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_10-26">Genesis 11:10-26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_24-27">1 Chronicles 1:24-27</span>).<br>
