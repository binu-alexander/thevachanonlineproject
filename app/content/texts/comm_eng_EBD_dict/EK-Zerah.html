An “Ethiopian,” probably Osorkon II., the successor of Shishak on the throne of Egypt. With an enormous army, the largest we read of in Scripture, he invaded the kingdom of Judah in the days of Asa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R214_9-15">2 Chronicles 14:9-15</span>). He reached Zephathah, and there encountered the army of Asa. This is the only instance “in all the annals of Judah of a victorious encounter in the field with a first-class heathen power in full force.” The Egyptian host was utterly routed, and the Hebrews gathered “exceeding much spoil.” Three hundred years elapsed before another Egyptian army, that of Necho (B.C. 609), came up against Jerusalem.<br>(2.) A son of Tamar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_30">Genesis 38:30</span>); called also Zara (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT1_3">Matthew 1:3</span>).<br>(3.) A Gershonite Levite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_21,41">1 Chronicles 6:21, 41</span>).<br>
