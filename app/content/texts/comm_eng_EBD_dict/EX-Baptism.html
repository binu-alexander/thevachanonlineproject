This was necessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal translation could properly express all that is implied in them.<br>The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greek word rendered “baptize.” Baptists say that it means “to dip,” and nothing else.<br>That is an incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word, “washings” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_10,13,19,21">Hebrews 9:10, 13, 19, 21</span>) or “baptisms,” designates them all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_38-41">2:38-41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB8_26-39">8:26-39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_17,18"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_17,18">9:17, 18</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB22_12-16">22:12-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_44-48">10:44-48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB16_32-34">16:32-34</span>) favours the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly improbable.<br>The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration of baptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible.<br>Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the two symbolical ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.<br>That which is essential in baptism is only “washing with water,” no mode being specified and none being necessary or essential to the symbolism of the ordinance.<br>The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_11">Matthew 3:11</span>) by his coming upon them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_8">Acts 1:8</span>). The fire also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the last days (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_17">2:17</span>). He uses also with the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal baptism “the apostles were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_15">11:15</span>), came upon them, sat on them.” That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted from such language to conclude that in like manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all these arguments “rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.” The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than those relating to its mode.<br>1. The controversy here is not about “believers’ baptism,” for that is common to all parties. Believers were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is “believers’ baptism.” Every instance of adult baptism, or of “believers’ baptism,” recorded in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_41">Acts 2:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_37">8:37</span>; 9:17, 18; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_47">10:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_15">16:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_5">19:5</span>, etc.) is just such as would be dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being “believers” would be required from every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.<br>2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of the baptism of the infants, or rather the “children,” of believing parents, the following considerations may be adduced: The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community. It is the“kingdom of God,” one historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the “church” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_38">Acts 7:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_4">Romans 9:4</span>) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is not a new and different church, but one with that of the Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a fact beyond dispute that the children of God’s people under the old dispensation were recognized as members of the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It was not because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being the children of God’s professing people, that this rite was administered (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM4_11">Romans 4:11</span>). If children were members of the church under the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are members of the church now by the same right, unless it can be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the Old Testament parents acted for their children and represented them. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_9">Genesis 9:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_10">17:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_7,8">Exodus 24:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_9-13">Deuteronomy 29:9-13</span>.) When parents entered into covenant with God, they brought their children with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into membership, he could not enter without bringing his children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the children of believers from the church. It does not deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament. There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea, anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_15">John 21:15</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_15">Luke 1:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_14">Matthew 19:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C17_14">1 Corinthians 7:14</span>).<br>“In a company of converts applying for admission into Christ’s house there are likely to be some heads of families. How is their case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to be received into the infant church of Philippi.<br>What is Christ’s direction to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect:‘Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For the present you must leave them where they are and come in by yourselves.’ One may reasonably demand very stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to his door bringing their children with them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, ‘Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house requires that the same day which witnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness their reception also’” (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).<br>
