Like portions were sent by the master to each guest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_4">1 Samuel 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_19">2 Samuel 6:19</span>), except when special honour was intended, when the portion was increased (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_34">Genesis 43:34</span>).<br>The Israelites were forbidden to attend heathenish sacrificial entertainments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_15">Exodus 34:15</span>), because these were in honour of false gods, and because at such feast they would be liable to partake of unclean flesh(<span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_28">1 Corinthians 10:28</span>).<br>In the entertainments common in apostolic times among the Gentiles were frequent “revellings,” against which Christians were warned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM13_13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_21">Galatians 5:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P14_3">1 Peter 4:3</span>).
