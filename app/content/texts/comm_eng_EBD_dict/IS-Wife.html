Monogamy was the original law under which man lived, but polygamy early commenced (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_19">Genesis 4:19</span>), and continued to prevail all down through Jewish history. The law of Moses regulated but did not prohibit polygamy. A man might have a plurality of wives, but a wife could have only one husband. A wifeâ€™s legal rights (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_10">Exodus 21:10</span>) and her duties (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_10-31">Proverbs 31:10-31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T15_14">1 Timothy 5:14</span>) are specified. She could be divorced in special cases (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_13-21">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</span>), but could not divorce her husband. Divorce was restricted by our Lord to the single case of adultery (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_3-9">Matthew 19:3-9</span>). The duties of husbands and wives in their relations to each other are distinctly set forth in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C17_2-5">1 Corinthians 7:2-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_22-33">Ephesians 5:22-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_18,19">Colossians 3:18, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P13_1-7">1 Peter 3:1-7</span>).<br>
