(1.) A son of Shimeah, and nephew of David. It was he who gave the fatal wicked advice to Amnon, the heir to the throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S213_3-6">2 Samuel 13:3-6</span>). He was very “subtil,” but unprincipled.<br>(2.) A son of Rechab, the founder of a tribe who bound themselves by a vow to abstain from wine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR35_6-19">Jeremiah 35:6-19</span>). There were different settlements of Rechabites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_16">Judges 1:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_11">4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_55">1 Chronicles 2:55</span>). (See RECHABITE.) His interview and alliance with Jehu are mentioned in 2 Kings 10:15-23. He went with Jehu in his chariot to Samaria.<br>
