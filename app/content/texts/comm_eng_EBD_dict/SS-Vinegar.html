This was the common sour wine (posea) daily made use of by the Roman soldiers. They gave it to Christ, not in derision, but from compassion, to assuage his thirst.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR10_26">Proverbs 10:26</span> shows that there was also a stronger vinegar, which was not fit for drinking. The comparison, “vinegar upon nitre,” probably means“vinegar upon soda” (as in the marg. of the R.V.), which then effervesces.<br>
