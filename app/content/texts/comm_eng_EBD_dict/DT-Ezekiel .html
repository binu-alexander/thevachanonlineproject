</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Ezekiel " ><div class="is"><b>EZEKIEL</b></div><br>"EZEKIEL", BOOK OF consists mainly of three groups of prophecies.<br>After an account of his call to the prophetical office (1-3:21), Ezekiel (1) utters words of denunciation against the Jews (3:22-24), warning them of the certain destruction of Jerusalem, in opposition to the words of the false prophets (4:1-3). The symbolical acts, by which the extremities to which Jerusalem would be reduced are described in ch. 4,5, show his intimate acquaintance with the Levitical legislation. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_30">Exodus 22:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_21">Deuteronomy 14:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_2">Leviticus 5:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_18,24">7:18,24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV17_15">17:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_7">19:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV22_8">22:8</span>, etc.)(2.) Prophecies against various surrounding nations: against the Ammonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_1-7">Ezekiel 25:1-7</span>), the Moabites (8-11), the Edomites (12-14), the Philistines (15-17), Tyre and Sidon (26-28), and against Egypt (29-32).<br>(3.) Prophecies delivered after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar: the triumphs of Israel and of the kingdom of God on earth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK33_-39">Ezekiel 33-39</span>); Messianic times, and the establishment and prosperity of the kingdom of God (40;48).<br>The closing visions of this book are referred to in the book of Revelation(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK38_">Ezekiel 38</span>=<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV20_8">Revelation 20:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK47_1-8">Ezekiel 47:1-8</span>=<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV22_1,2">Revelation 22:1,2</span>). Other references to this book are also found in the New Testament. (Comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="RM2_24">Romans 2:24</span> with <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK36_2">Ezekiel 36:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM10_5">Romans 10:5</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_12">Galatians 3:12</span> with <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK20_11">Ezekiel 20:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P23_4">2 Peter 3:4</span> with <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK12_22">Ezekiel 12:22</span>.) It may be noted that Daniel, fourteen years after his deportation from Jerusalem, is mentioned by Ezekiel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK14_14">14:14</span>) along with Noah and Job as distinguished for his righteousness, and some five years later he is spoken of as pre-eminent for his wisdom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK28_3">28:3</span>).<br>Ezekiel’s prophecies are characterized by symbolical and allegorical representations, “unfolding a rich series of majestic visions and of colossal symbols.” There are a great many also of “symbolcal actions embodying vivid conceptions on the part of the prophet” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK4_1-4">4:1-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK5_1-4">5:1-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK12_3-6">12:3-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK24_3-5">24:3-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK37_16">37:16</span>, etc.) “The mode of representation, in which symbols and allegories occupy a prominent place, gives a dark, mysterious character to the prophecies of Ezekiel. They are obscure and enigmatical. A cloudy mystery overhangs them which it is almost impossible to penetrate.<br>Jerome calls the book ‘a labyrith of the mysteries of God.’ It was because of this obscurity that the Jews forbade any one to read it till he had attained the age of thirty.” Ezekiel is singular in the frequency with which he refers to the Pentateuch(e.g., <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_">Ezekiel 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK28_13">28:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_8">31:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK36_11,34">36:11, 34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK47_13">47:13</span>, etc.). He shows also an acquaintance with the writings of Hosea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK37_22">Ezekiel 37:22</span>), Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK8_12">Ezekiel 8:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_6">29:6</span>), and especially with those of Jeremiah, his older contemporary(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR24_7,9">Jeremiah 24:7, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_37">48:37</span>).<br>
