</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Heresy" ><div class="is"><b>HERESY</b></div><br>"HERESY "from a Greek word signifying (1) a choice, (2) the opinion chosen, and (3) the sect holding the opinion. In the Acts of the Apostles(5:17; 15:5; 24:5, 14; 26:5) it denotes a sect, without reference to its character. Elsewhere, however, in the New Testament it has a different meaning attached to it. Paul ranks “heresies” with crimes and seditions(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL5_20">Galatians 5:20</span>). This word also denotes divisions or schisms in the church(<span class="bibleref" data-id="C111_19">1 Corinthians 11:19</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT3_10">Titus 3:10</span> a “heretical person” is one who follows his own self-willed “questions,” and who is to be avoided.<br>Heresies thus came to signify self-chosen doctrines not emanating from God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_1">2 Peter 2:1</span>).<br>
