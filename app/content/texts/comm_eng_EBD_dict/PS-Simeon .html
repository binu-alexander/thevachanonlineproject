They gradually dwindled in number, and sank into a position of insignificance among the other tribes. They decreased in the wilderness by about two-thirds (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_23">Numbers 1:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_14">26:14</span>). Moses pronounces no blessing on this tribe. It is passed by in silence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_">Deuteronomy 33</span>).<br>This tribe received as their portion a part of the territory already allotted to Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_1-9">Joshua 19:1-9</span>). It lay in the south-west of the land, with Judah on the east and Dan on the north; but whether it was a compact territory or not cannot be determined. The subsequent notices of this tribe are but few (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_24-43">1 Chronicles 4:24-43</span>). Like Reuben on the east of Jordan, this tribe had little influence on the history of Israel.<br>
