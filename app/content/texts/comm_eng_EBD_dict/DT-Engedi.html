To the wilderness near this town David fled for fear of Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_62"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_62">Joshua 15:62</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_29">1 Samuel 23:29</span>). It was at first called Hazezon-tamar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_7">Genesis 14:7</span>), a city of the Amorites.<br>The vineyards of Engedi were celebrated in Solomon’s time (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_4">1:4</span>). It is the modern ‘Ain Jidy. The “fountain” from which it derives its name rises on the mountain side about 600 feet above the sea, and in its rapid descent spreads luxuriance all around it. Along its banks the osher grows abundantly. That shrub is thus described by Porter: “The stem is stout, measuring sometimes nearly a foot in diameter, and the plant grows to the height of 15 feet or more. It has a grayish bark and long oval leaves, which when broken off discharge a milky fluid. The fruit resembles an apple, and hangs in clusters of two or three. When ripe it is of a rich yellow colour, but on being pressed it explodes like a puff-ball. It is chiefly filled with air...This is the so-called ‘apple of Sodom.’” Through Samaria, etc. (See APPLE.)
