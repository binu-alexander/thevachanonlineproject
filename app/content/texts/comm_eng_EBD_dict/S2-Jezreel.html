A town of Issachar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_18">Joshua 19:18</span>), where the kings of Israel often resided (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_45">1 Kings 18:45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_1">21:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_30">2 Kings 9:30</span>). Here Elijah met Ahab, Jehu, and Bidkar; and here Jehu executed his dreadful commission against the house of Ahab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_14-37">2 Kings 9:14-37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_1-11">10:1-11</span>). It has been identified with the modern Zerin, on the most western point of the range of Gilboa, reaching down into the great and fertile valley of Jezreel, to which it gave its name.<br>(2.) A town in Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_56">Joshua 15:56</span>), to the south-east of Hebron.<br>Ahinoam, one of Davidâ€™s wives, probably belonged to this place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_3">1 Samuel 27:3</span>).<br>(3.) A symbolical name given by Hosea to his oldest son (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_4">1:4</span>), in token of a great slaughter predicted by him, like that which had formerly taken place in the plain of Esdraelon (comp. Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S11_4,5">1:4, 5</span>).<br>
