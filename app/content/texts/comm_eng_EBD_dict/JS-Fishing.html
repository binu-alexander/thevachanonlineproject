It was from the fishing-nets that Jesus called his disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16-20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16">Mark 1:16</span>-20</span>), and it was in a fishing-boat he rebuked the winds and the waves (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_26">Matthew 8:26</span>) and delivered that remarkable series of prophecies recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_">Matthew 13</span>. He twice miraculously fed multitudes with fish and bread (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_19">Matthew 14:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_36">15:36</span>). It was in the mouth of a fish that the tribute-money was found (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_27">Matthew 17:27</span></span>). And he “ate a piece of broiled fish” with his disciples after his resurrection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_42,43">Luke 24:42, 43</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_3">Acts 1:3</span>). At the Sea of Tiberias (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_1-14">John 21:1-14</span>), in obedience to his direction, the disciples cast their net “on the right side of the ship,” and enclosed so many that “they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.” Two kinds of fishing-nets are mentioned in the New Testament:(1.) The casting-net (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_18">Matthew 4:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16">Mark 1:16</span>).<br>(2.) The drag-net or seine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_">Matthew 13</span>:48).<br>Fish were also caught by the fishing-hook (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_27">Matthew 17:27</span></span>). (See NET.)
