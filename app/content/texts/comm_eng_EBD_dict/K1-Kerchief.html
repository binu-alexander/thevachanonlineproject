The precise meaning of the word is uncertain. It appears to have been a long loose shawl, such as Oriental women wrap themselves in (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_15">Ruth 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span>). Some think that it was a long veil or head-dress, denoting by its form the position of those who wore it.<br>
