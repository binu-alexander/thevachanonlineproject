He went from the land of Shinar and built Nineveh, etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_11,12">Genesis 10:11,12</span>).<br>He probably gave his name to Assyria, which is the usual translation of the word, although the form Asshur is sometimes retained (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_22,24">Numbers 24:22, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_23">Ezekiel 27:23</span>, etc.). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_14">Genesis 2:14</span> “Assyria” ought to be“Asshur,” which was the original capital of Assyria, a city represented by the mounds of Kalah Sherghat, on the west bank of the Tigris. This city was founded by Bel-kap-kapu about B.C. 1700. At a later date the capital was shifted to Ninua, or Nineveh, now Koyunjik, on the eastern bank of the river. (See CALAH; NINEVEH.)
