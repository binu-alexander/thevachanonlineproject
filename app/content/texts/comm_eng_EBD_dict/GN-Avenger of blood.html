It was his right and duty to slay the murderer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S214_7,11">2 Samuel 14:7, 11</span>) if he found him outside of a city of refuge. In order that this law might be guarded against abuse, Moses appointed six cities of refuge (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_13">Exodus 21:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_13">Numbers 35:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT19_1,9">Deuteronomy 19:1,9</span>). These were in different parts of the country, and every facility was afforded the manslayer that he might flee to the city that lay nearest him for safety. Into the city of refuge the avenger durst not follow him. This arrangement applied only to cases where the death was not premeditated. The case had to be investigated by the authorities of the city, and the wilful murderer was on no account to be spared. He was regarded as an impure and polluted person, and was delivered up to the goel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT19_11-13">Deuteronomy 19:11-13</span>). If the offence was merely manslaughter, then the fugitive must remain within the city till the death of the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_25">Numbers 35:25</span>).<br>
