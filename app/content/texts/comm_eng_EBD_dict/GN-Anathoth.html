The Jews, as a rule, did not change the names of the towns they found in Palestine; hence this town may be regarded as deriving its name from the goddess Anat. It was the native place of Abiezer, one of David’s “thirty” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_27">2 Samuel 23:27</span>), and of Jehu, another of his mighty men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_3">1 Chronicles 12:3</span>). It is chiefly notable, however, as the birth-place and usual residence of Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR1_1">Jeremiah 1:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR11_21-23">11:21-23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR29_27">29:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_7-9">32:7-9</span>). It suffered greatly from the army of Sennacherib, and only 128 men returned to it from the Exile (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_27">Nehemiah 7:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_23">Ezra 2:23</span>). It lay about 3 miles north of Jerusalem. It has been identified with the small and poor village of ‘Anata, containing about 100 inhabitants.<br>
