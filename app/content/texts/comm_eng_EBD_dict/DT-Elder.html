</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Elder" ><div class="is"><b>ELDER</b></div><br>"ELDER "a name frequently used in the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to respect and reverence(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN50_7">Genesis 50:7</span>). It also denoted a political office (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_7">Numbers 22:7</span>). The“elders of Israel” held a rank among the people indicative of authority.<br>Moses opened his commission to them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_16">Exodus 3:16</span>). They attended Moses on all important occasions. Seventy of them attended on him at the giving of the law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_1">Exodus 24:1</span>). Seventy also were selected from the whole number to bear with Moses the burden of the people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_16,17">Numbers 1<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_1">1:1</span>6, 17</span>).<br>The “elder” is the keystone of the social and political fabric wherever the patriarchal system exists. At the present day this is the case among the Arabs, where the sheik (i.e., “the old man”) is the highest authority in the tribe. The body of the “elders” of Israel were the representatives of the people from the very first, and were recognized as such by Moses. All down through the history of the Jews we find mention made of the elders as exercising authority among the people. They appear as governors(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT31_28">Deuteronomy 31:28</span>), as local magistrates (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_18">16:18</span>), administering justice(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT19_12">19:12</span>). They were men of extensive influence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_26-31">1 Samuel 30:26-31</span>). In New Testament times they also appear taking an active part in public affairs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_21">Matthew 16:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_23">21:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_59">26:59</span>).<br>The Jewish eldership was transferred from the old dispensation to the new. “The creation of the office of elder is nowhere recorded in the New Testament, as in the case of deacons and apostles, because the latter offices were created to meet new and special emergencies, while the former was transmitted from the earlies times. In other words, the office of elder was the only permanent essential office of the church under either dispensation.” The “elders” of the New Testament church were the “pastors” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_11">Ephesians 4:11</span>), “bishops or overseers” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_28">Acts 20:28</span>), “leaders” and “rulers”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_7">Hebrews 13:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H15_12">1 Thessalonians 5:12</span>) of the flock. Everywhere in the New Testament bishop and presbyter are titles given to one and the same officer of the Christian church. He who is called presbyter or elder on account of his age or gravity is also called bishop or overseer with reference to the duty that lay upon him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="TT1_5-7">Titus 1:5-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_17-28">Acts 20:17-28</span>; Phil.<br>1:1).<br>
