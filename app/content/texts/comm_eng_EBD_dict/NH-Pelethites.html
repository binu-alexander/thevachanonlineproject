The word probably means “runners” or “couriers,” and may denote that while forming part of David’s bodyguard, they were also sometimes employed as couriers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_18">2 Samuel 8:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_7,23">20:7, 23</span>;<span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_38,44">1 Kings 1:38, 44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_17">1 Chronicles 18:17</span>).
