They then for the first time inhabited cities (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN47_3">Genesis 47:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_7">Exodus 12:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_9">Hebrews 11:9</span>). From the earliest times the Assyrians and the Canaanites were builders of cities. The Hebrews after the Conquest took possession of the captured cities, and seem to have followed the methods of building that had been pursued by the Canaanites. Reference is made to the stone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_9">1 Kings 7:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_10">Isaiah 9:10</span>) and marble (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_2">1 Chronicles 29:2</span>) used in building, and to the internal wood-work of the houses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K16_15">1 Kings 6:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_2">7:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_11,12">10:11, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R23_5">2 Chronicles 3:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14">Jeremiah 22:14</span></span>). “Ceiled houses” were such as had beams inlaid in the walls to which wainscotting was fastened (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER6_4">Ezra 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_14">Jeremiah 22:14</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG1_4">Haggai 1:4</span>). “Ivory houses” had the upper parts of the walls adorned with figures in stucco with gold and ivory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_39">1 Kings 22:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R23_6">2 Chronicles 3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_8">Psalm 45:8</span>).<br>The roofs of the dwelling-houses were flat, and are often alluded to in Scripture (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_2">2 Samuel 11:2</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_1">Isaiah 22:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_17">Matthew 24:17</span>). Sometimes tents or booths were erected on them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_22">2 Samuel <span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_22">16:22</span></span>). They were protected by parapets or low walls (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_8">Deuteronomy 22:8</span>). On the house-tops grass sometimes grew (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR19_13">Proverbs <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR19_13">19:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR27_15">27:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS129_6,7">Psalm 129:6, 7</span>). They were used, not only as places of recreation in the evening, but also sometimes as sleeping-places at night (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_25,26">1 Samuel 9:25, 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_2">2 Samuel 11:2</span></span>; 16:22; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN4_29">Daniel 4:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB27_18">Job 27:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR21_9">Proverbs 21:9</span>), and as places of devotion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_29">Jeremiah 32:29</span>; 19:13).<br>
