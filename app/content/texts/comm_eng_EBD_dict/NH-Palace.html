In the Authorized Version there are many different words so rendered, presenting different ideas, such as that of citadel or lofty fortress or royal residence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH1_1">Nehemiah 1:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_2">Daniel 8:2</span>). It is the name given to the temple fortress (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_8">Nehemiah 2:8</span>) and to the temple itself (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_1">1 Chronicles 29:1</span>). It denotes also a spacious building or a great house (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN1_4">Daniel 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN4_4,29">4:4, 29</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET1_5">Esther 1:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET7_7">7:7</span>), and a fortified place or an enclosure (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_4">Ezekiel 25:4</span>). Solomon’s palace is described in 1 Kings 7:1-12 as a series of buildings rather than a single great structure. Thirteen years were spent in their erection. This palace stood on the eastern hill, adjoining the temple on the south.<br>In the New Testament it designates the official residence of Pilate or that of the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_3,58,69">Matthew 26:3, 58, 69</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_54,66">Mark 14:54, 66</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_15">John 18:15</span>). In Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_13">1:13</span> this word is the rendering of the Greek praitorion, meaning the praetorian cohorts at Rome (the life-guard of the Caesars). Paul was continually chained to a soldier of that corps (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_16">Acts 28:16</span>), and hence his name and sufferings became known in all the praetorium. The “soldiers that kept” him would, on relieving one another on guard, naturally spread the tidings regarding him among their comrades. Some, however, regard the praetroium (q.v.) as the barrack within the palace (the palatium) of the Caesars in Rome where a detachment of these praetorian guards was stationed, or as the camp of the guards placed outside the eastern walls of Rome.<br>“In the chambers which were occupied as guard-rooms,” says Dr.<br>Manning, “by the praetorian troops on duty in the palace, a number of rude caricatures are found roughly scratched upon the walls, just such as may be seen upon barrack walls in every part of the world. Amongst these is one of a human figure nailed upon a cross. To add to the ‘offence of the cross,’ the crucified one is represented with the head of an animal, probably that of an ass. Before it stands the figure of a Roman legionary with one hand upraised in the attitude of worship. Underneath is the rude, misspelt, ungrammatical inscription, Alexamenos worships his God. It can scarcely be doubted that we have here a contemporary caricature, executed by one of the praetorian guard, ridiculing the faith of a Christian comrade.”
