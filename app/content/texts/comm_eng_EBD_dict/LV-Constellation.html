In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_10">Isaiah 13:10</span>, where this word only occurs, it is the rendering of the Hebrew kesil, i.e., “fool.” This was the Hebrew name of the constellation Orion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_9">Job 9:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_31">38:31</span>), a constellation which represented Nimrod, the symbol of folly and impiety. The word some interpret by“the giant” in this place, “some heaven-daring rebel who was chained to the sky for his impiety.”
