The dove from the ark brought an olive-branch to Noah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_11">Genesis 8:11</span>). It is mentioned among the most notable trees of Palestine, where it was cultivated long before the time of the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT6_11">Deuteronomy 6:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_8">8:8</span>). It is mentioned in the first Old Testament parable, that of Jotham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_9">Judges 9:9</span>), and is named among the blessings of the “good land,” and is at the present day the one characteristic tree of Palestine. The oldest olive-trees in the country are those which are enclosed in the Garden of Gethsemane. It is referred to as an emblem of prosperity and beauty and religious privilege (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS52_8">Psalm 52:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR11_16">Jeremiah 11:16</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_6">14:6</span>). The two “witnesses” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV11_4">Revelation 11:4</span> are spoken of as “two olive trees standing before the God of the earth.” (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC4_3,11-14">Zechariah 4:3, 11-14</span>.) The “olive-tree, wild by nature” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_24">Romans <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_24">11:24</span></span>), is the shoot or cutting of the good olive-tree which, left ungrafted, grows up to be a “wild olive.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_17">Romans 11:17</span> Paul refers to the practice of grafting shoots of the wild olive into a “good” olive which has become unfruitful. By such a process the sap of the good olive, by pervading the branch which is “graffed in,” makes it a good branch, bearing good olives. Thus the Gentiles, being a“wild olive,” but now “graffed in,” yield fruit, but only through the sap of the tree into which they have been graffed. This is a process “contrary to nature” (11:24).<br>
