(1.) In the Old Testament it is called the “sea of Chinnereth” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU34_11">Numbers 34:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_3">Joshua 12:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_27">13:27</span>), as is supposed from its harp-like shape. (2). The “lake of Gennesareth” once by Luke (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_1">5:1</span>), from the flat district lying on its west coast. (3.) John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_1">6:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_1">21:1</span>) calls it the “sea of Tiberias” (q.v.). The modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.<br>This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet.<br>The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.<br>Its present appearance is thus described: “The utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!” This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, “his own city” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_1">Matthew 9:1</span>), stood on its shores.<br>From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be “fishers of men” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_18">Matthew 4:18</span>,22; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16-20">Mark 1:16-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_1-11">Luke 5: 1-11</span>). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, “Peace, be still” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_23-27">Matthew 8:23-27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_31-35">Mark 7:31-35</span>); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_">John 21</span>).<br>“The Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.”
