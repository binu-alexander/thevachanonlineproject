He was the brother-in-law of So (q.v.). He probably ascended the throne about B.C. 692, having been previously king of Ethiopia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_9">2 Kings 19:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_9">Isaiah 37:9</span>), which with Egypt now formed one nation. He was a great warrior, and but little is known of him. The Assyrian armies under Esarhaddon, and again under Assur-bani-pal, invaded Egypt and defeated Tirhakah, who afterwards retired into Ethiopia, where he died, after reigning twenty-six years.<br>
