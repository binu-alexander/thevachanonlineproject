This word denotes the special privileges and advantages belonging to the first-born son among the Jews. He became the priest of the family. Thus Reuben was the first-born of the patriarchs, and so the priesthood of the tribes belonged to him. That honour was, however, transferred by God from Reuben to Levi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_12,13">Numbers 3:12, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU8_18">8:18</span>).<br>(2.) The first-born son had allotted to him also a double portion of the paternal inheritance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_15-17">Deuteronomy 21:15-17</span>). Reuben was, because of his undutiful conduct, deprived of his birth-right (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_4">Genesis 49:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_1">1 Chronicles 5:1</span>). Esau transferred his birth-right to Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN25_33">Genesis 25:33</span>).<br>(3.) The first-born inherited the judicial authority of his father, whatever it might be (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R221_3">2 Chronicles 21:3</span>). By divine appointment, however, David excluded Adonijah in favour of Solomon.<br>(4.) The Jews attached a sacred importance to the rank of “first-born” and“first-begotten” as applied to the Messiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_29">Romans 8:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_18">Colossians 1:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_4-6">Hebrews 1:4-6</span>). As first-born he has an inheritance superior to his brethren, and is the alone true priest.<br>
