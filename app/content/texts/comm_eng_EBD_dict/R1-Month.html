From the time of the institution of the Mosaic law the month among the Jews was lunar. The cycle of religious feasts depended on the moon. The commencement of a month was determined by the observation of the new moon. The number of months in the year was usually twelve (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_7">1 Kings 4:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_1-15">1 Chronicles 27:1-15</span>); but every third year an additional month(ve-Adar) was inserted, so as to make the months coincide with the seasons.<br>“The Hebrews and Phoenicians had no word for month save ‘moon,’ and only saved their calendar from becoming vague like that of the Moslems by the interpolation of an additional month. There is no evidence at all that they ever used a true solar year such as the Egyptians possessed. The latter had twelve months of thirty days and five epagomenac or odd days.”, Palestine Quarterly, January 1889.<br>
