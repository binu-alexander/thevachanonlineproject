Along with his three brothers he was consecrated to the priest’s office (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_1">Exodus 28:1</span>).<br>With his father and elder brother he accompanied the seventy elders part of the way up the mount with Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_1,9">Exodus 24:1,9</span>). On one occasion he and Nadab his brother offered incense in their censers filled with “strange”(i.e., common) fire, i.e., not with fire taken from the great brazen altar(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV6_9">Leviticus 6:9</span>, etc.), and for this offence they were struck dead, and were taken out and buried without the camp (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_1-11">Leviticus 10:1-11</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_4">Numbers 3:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_61">26:61</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_2">1 Chronicles 24:2</span>). It is probable that when they committed this offence they were intoxicated, for immediately after is given the law prohibiting the use of wine or strong drink to the priests.<br>
