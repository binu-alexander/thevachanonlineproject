(1.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_16">1 Chronicles 24:16</span>, “Jehezekel.”(2.) One of the great prophets, the son of Buzi the priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK1_3">Ezekiel 1:3</span>). He was one of the Jewish exiles who settled at Tel-Abib, on the banks of the Chebar, “in the land of the Chaldeans.” He was probably carried away captive with Jehoiachin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK1_2">1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_14-16">2 Kings 24:14-16</span>) about B.C. 597. His prophetic call came to him “in the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s captivity”(B.C. 594). He had a house in the place of his exile, where he lost his wife, in the ninth year of his exile, by some sudden and unforeseen stroke(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK8_1">Ezekiel <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK8_1">8:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK24_18">24:18</span>). He held a prominent place among the exiles, and was frequently consulted by the elders (8:1; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK11_25">11:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK14_1">14:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK20_1">20:1</span>). His ministry extended over twenty-three years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_17">29:17</span>), B.C. 595-573, during part of which he was contemporary with Daniel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK14_14">14:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK28_3">28:3</span>) and Jeremiah, and probably also with Obadiah. The time and manner of his death are unknown. His reputed tomb is pointed out in the neighbourhood of Bagdad, at a place called Keffil.<br>
