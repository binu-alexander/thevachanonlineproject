After the Hebrews became settled in Palestine they began to engage in commercial pursuits, which gradually expanded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_13">49:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_18">Deuteronomy 33:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_17">Judges 5:17</span>), till in the time of Solomon they are found in the chief marts of the world (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26">1 Kings 9:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_11,26,28">10:11, 26, 28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_48">22:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R21_16">2 Chronicles 1:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_10,21">9:10, 21</span>). After Solomon’s time their trade with foreign nations began to decline. After the Exile it again expanded into wider foreign relations, because now the Jews were scattered in many lands.<br>
