Several women are mentioned in Scripture as having been endowed with prophetic gifts, as Miriam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20">Exodus 15:20</span>), Deborah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_4,5">Judges 4:4, 5</span>), Huldah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K222_14">2 Kings 22:14</span>), Noadiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH6_14">Nehemiah 6:14</span>), Anna (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_36,37">Luke 2:36, 37</span>), and the daughters of Philip the evangelist(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_8,9">Acts 21:8, 9</span>). Women are forbidden to teach publicly (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C114_34,35">1 Corinthians 14:34, 35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_11,12">1 Timothy 2:11, 12</span>). Among the Hebrews it devolved upon women to prepare the meals for the household (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6">Genesis 18:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S213_8">2 Samuel 13:8</span>), to attend to the work of spinning (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_26">Exodus 35:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_19">Proverbs 31:19</span>), and making clothes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_19">1 Samuel 2:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_21">Proverbs 31:21</span>), to bring water from the well (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_15">Genesis 24:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_11">1 Samuel 9:11</span>), and to care for the flocks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_6">Genesis 29:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_16">Exodus 2:16</span>).<br>The word “woman,” as used in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT15_28">Matthew 15:28</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN2_4">John 2:4</span> and 20:13, 15, implies tenderness and courtesy and not disrespect. Only where revelation is known has woman her due place of honour assigned to her.<br>
