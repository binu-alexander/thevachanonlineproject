The son of Immer (probably the same as Amariah, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH10_3">Nehemiah 10:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_2">12:2</span>), the head of one of the priestly courses, was “chief governor [Hebrews paqid nagid, meaning “deputy governor”] of the temple” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR20_1,2">Jeremiah 20:1, 2</span>). At this time the nagid, or “governor,” of the temple was Seraiah the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_14">1 Chronicles 6:14</span>), and Pashur was his paqid, or “deputy.” Enraged at the plainness with which Jeremiah uttered his solemn warnings of coming judgements, because of the abounding iniquity of the times, Pashur ordered the temple police to seize him, and after inflicting on him corporal punishment (forty stripes save one, <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT25_3">Deuteronomy 25:3</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_24">2 Corinthians 11:24</span>), to put him in the stocks in the high gate of Benjamin, where he remained all night. On being set free in the morning, Jeremiah went to Pashur (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR20_3,5">Jeremiah 20:3, 5</span>), and announced to him that God had changed his name to Magor-missabib, i.e., “terror on every side.” The punishment that fell upon him was probably remorse, when he saw the ruin he had brought upon his country by advising a close alliance with Egypt in opposition to the counsels of Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR20_4-6">20:4-6</span>). He was carried captive to Babylon, and died there.<br>(2.) A priest sent by king Zedekiah to Jeremiah to inquire of the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_9">1 Chronicles 24:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR21_1">Jeremiah 21:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR38_1-6">38:1-6</span>). He advised that the prophet should be put to death.<br>(3.) The father of Gedaliah. He was probably the same as (1).<br>
