The goel among the Hebrews was the nearest male blood relation alive. Certain important obligations devolved upon him toward his next of kin. (1.) If any one from poverty was unable to redeem his inheritance, it was the duty of the kinsman to redeem it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_25,28">Leviticus 25:25,28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_9,12">Ruth 3:9, 12</span>). He was also required to redeem his relation who had sold himself into slavery(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_48,49">Leviticus 25:48, 49</span>).<br>God is the Goel of his people because he redeems them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_6">Exodus 6:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS43_1">Isaiah 43:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS41_14">41:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_6,22">44:6, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS48_20">48:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS103_4">Psalm 103:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB19_25">Job 19:25</span>, etc.).<br>(2.) The goel also was the avenger (q.v.) of blood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_21">Numbers 35:21</span>) in the case of the murder of the next of kin.<br>
