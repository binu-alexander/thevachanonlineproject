It is distinguished from the camel only as a trained saddle-horse is distinguished from a cart-horse. It is remarkable for its speed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_23">Jeremiah 2:23</span>). Camels are frequently spoken of in partriarchal times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16">Genesis 12:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_10">24:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_43">30:43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_17">31:17</span>, etc.). They were used for carrying burdens (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_25">Genesis 37:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_5">Judges 6:5</span>), and for riding (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_64">Genesis 24:64</span>). The hair of the camel falls off of itself in spring, and is woven into coarse cloths and garments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_4">Matthew 3:4</span>).<br>(See CAMEL.)
