(1.) In the fourth month after the Exodus, when the people were encamped at Sinai. The number of men from twenty years old and upward was then 603,550 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX38_26">Exodus 38:26</span>). (2.) Another census was made just before the entrance into Canaan, when the number was found to be 601,730, showing thus a small decrease (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_51">Numbers 26:51</span>). (3.) The next census was in the time of David, when the number, exclusive of the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, was found to be 1,300,000 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_9">2 Samuel 24:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_5">1 Chronicles 21:5</span>). (4.) Solomon made a census of the foreigners in the land, and found 153,600 able-bodied workmen (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R22_17,18">2 Chronicles 2:17, 18</span>). (5.) After the return from Exile the whole congregation of Israel was numbered, and found to amount to 42,360 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_64">Ezra 2:64</span>). A census was made by the Roman government in the time of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_1">Luke 2:1</span>). (See TAXING.)
