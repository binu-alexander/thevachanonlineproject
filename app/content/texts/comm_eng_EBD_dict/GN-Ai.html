One of the royal cities of the Canaanites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_1">Joshua 10:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_8">Genesis 12:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_3">13:3</span>). It was the scene of Joshua’s defeat, and afterwards of his victory. It was the second Canaanite city taken by Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS7_2-5">Joshua 7:2-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS8_1-29">8:1-29</span>). It lay rebuilt and inhibited by the Benjamites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_28">Ezra 2:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_32">Nehemiah 7:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_31">11:31</span>). It lay to the east of Bethel, “beside Beth-aven.” The spot which is most probably the site of this ancient city is Haiyan, 2 miles east from Bethel. It lay up the Wady Suweinit, a steep, rugged valley, extending from the Jordan valley to Bethel.<br>(2.) A city in the Ammonite territory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_3">Jeremiah 49:3</span>). Some have thought that the proper reading of the word is Ar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS15_1">Isaiah 15:1</span>).<br>
