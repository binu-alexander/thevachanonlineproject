Christians are warned against “eye-service” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_6">Ephesians 6:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_22">Colossians 3:22</span>). Men were sometimes punished by having their eyes put out (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_2">1 Samuel 11:2</span>; Samson, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21">Judges 16:21</span>; Zedekiah, <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_7">2 Kings 25:7</span>).<br>The custom of painting the eyes is alluded to in 2 Kings 9:30, R.V.; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_30">Jeremiah 4:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_40">Ezekiel 23:40</span>, a custom which still prevails extensively among Eastern women.<br>
