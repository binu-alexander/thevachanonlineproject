She showed her affection for him by promoting his escape to Naioth when Saul sought his life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_12-17">1 Samuel 19:12-17</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS59_">Psalm 59</span>. See TERAPHIM). After this she did not see David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in marriage to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_44">1 Samuel 25:44</span>), but David afterwards formally reclaimed her as his lawful wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_13-16">2 Samuel 3:13-16</span>). The relation between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy City. In David’s conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_29">1 Chronicles 15:29</span>). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In 2 Samuel 21:8 her name again occurs, but the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_19">1 Samuel 18:19</span>).<br>
