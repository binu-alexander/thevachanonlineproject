The ark was brought to this place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_1,2">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</span>) from Beth-shemesh and put in charge of Abinadab, a Levite. Here it remained till it was removed by David to Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_2,3,12">2 Samuel 6:2, 3, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_1-29">1 Chronicles 15:1-29</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_">Psalm 132</span>). It was also called Baalah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_9">Joshua 15:9</span>) and Kirjath-baal (60). It has been usually identified with Kuriet el-‘Enab (i.e., “city of grapes”), among the hills, about 8 miles north-east of ‘Ain Shems (i.e., Beth-shemesh). The opinion, however, that it is to be identified with ‘Erma, 4 miles east of ‘Ain Shems, on the edge of the valley of Sorek, seems to be better supported. (See KIRJATH.) The words of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS132_">Psalm 132</span>:6, “We found it in the fields of the wood,” refer to the sojourn of the ark at Kirjath-jearim. “Wood” is here the rendering of the Hebrew word jaar, which is the singular of jearim.<br>
