Those who were strangers generally, and who owned no landed property.<br>(2.) Strangers dwelling in another country without being naturalized(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV22_10">Leviticus 22:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS39_12">Psalm 39:12</span>).<br>Both of these classes were to enjoy, under certain conditions, the same rights as other citizens (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_33,34">Leviticus 19:33, 34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT10_19">Deuteronomy 10:19</span>). They might be naturalized and permitted to enter into the congregation of the Lord by submitting to circumcision and abandoning idolatry(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_3-8">Deuteronomy 23:3-8</span>).<br>This term is used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_12">Ephesians 2:12</span>) to denote persons who have no interest in Christ.<br>
