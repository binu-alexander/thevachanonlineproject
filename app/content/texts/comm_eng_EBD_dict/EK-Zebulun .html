It was one of the tribes which did not drive out the Canaanites, but only made them tributary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_30">Judges 1:30</span>). It took little interest in public affairs. It responded, however, readily to the summons of Gideon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_35">6:35</span>), and afterwards assisted in enthroning David at Hebron (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_33,40">1 Chronicles 12:33, 40</span>). Along with the other northern tribes, Zebulun was carried away into the land of Assyria by Tiglath-pileser (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_29">2 Kings 15:29</span>).<br>In Deborah’s song the words, “Out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_14">Judges 5:14</span>) has been rendered in the R.V., “They that handle the marshal’s staff.” This is a questionable rendering. “The word sopher(‘scribe’ or ‘writer’) defines the word shebhet (‘rod’ or ‘pen’) with which it is conjoined. The ‘rod of the scribe’ on the Assyrian monuments was the stylus of wood or metal, with the help of which the clay tablet was engraved, or the papyrus inscribed with characters. The scribe who wielded it was the associate and assistant of the ‘lawgivers.’” (Sayce).<br>
