It belongs to the labiate family of plants. The species most common in Syria is the Mentha sylvestris, the wild mint, which grows much larger than the garden mint (M. sativa). It was much used in domestic economy as a condiment, and also as a medicine. The paying of tithes of mint was in accordance with the Mosiac law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_22">Deuteronomy 14:22</span>), but the error of the Pharisees lay in their being more careful about this little matter of the mint than about weightier matters.<br>
