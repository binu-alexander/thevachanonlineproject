Some have interpreted the Hebrew word by“petrel” or “shearwater” (Puffinus cinereus), which is found on the coast of Syria; others think it denotes the “sea-gull” or “seamew.” The common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) feeds on reptiles and large insects. It is found in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. It only passes the winter in Palestine. The Arabs suppose it to utter the cry Yakub, and hence they call it tir el-Yakub; i.e., “Jacob’s bird.”
