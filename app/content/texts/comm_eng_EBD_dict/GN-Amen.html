</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Amen" ><div class="is"><b>AMEN</b></div><br>"AMEN" This Hebrew word means firm, and hence also faithful (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_14">Revelation 3:14</span></span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS65_16">Isaiah 65:16</span>, the Authorized Version has “the God of truth,” which in Hebrew is “the God of Amen.” It is frequently used by our Saviour to give emphasis to his words, where it is translated “verily.” Sometimes, only, however, in John’s Gospel, it is repeated, “Verily, verily.” It is used as an epithet of the Lord Jesus Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_14">Revelation 3:14</span></span>).<br>It is found singly and sometimes doubly at the end of prayers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS41_13">Psalm 41:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS72_19">72:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_52">89:52</span>), to confirm the words and invoke the fulfilment of them. It is used in token of being bound by an oath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU5_22">Numbers 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT27_15-26">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH5_13">Nehemiah 5:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_6">8:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R116_36">1 Chronicles 16:36</span>). In the primitive churches it was common for the general audience to say “Amen” at the close of the prayer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C114_16">1 Corinthians 14:16</span>).<br>The promises of God are Amen; i.e., they are all true and sure (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C21_20">2 Corinthians 1:20</span>).<br>
