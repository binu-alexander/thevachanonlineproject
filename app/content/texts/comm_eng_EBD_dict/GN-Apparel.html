The statute forbidding men to wear female apparel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_5">Deuteronomy 22:5</span>) referred especially to ornaments and head-dresses. Both men and women wore (1) an under garment or tunic, which was bound by a girdle. One who had only this tunic on was spoken of as “naked” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_24">1 Samuel 19:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB24_10">Job 24:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_2">Isaiah 20:2</span></span>). Those in high stations sometimes wore two tunics, the outer being called the “upper garment” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_27">1 Samuel 15:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_4">18:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_5">24:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_20">Job 1:20</span>). (2.) They wore in common an over-garment (“mantle,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_13">1 Kings 19:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K22_13">2 Kings 2:13</span>), a loose and flowing robe. The folds of this upper garment could be formed into a lap (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_15">Ruth 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS79_12">Psalm 79:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR17_23">Proverbs 17:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_38">Luke 6:38</span>).<br>Generals of armies usually wore scarlet robes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_26">Judges 8:26</span>; Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_3">2:3</span>). A form of conspicuous raiment is mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_46">Luke 20:46</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_5">Matthew 23:5</span>.<br>Priests alone wore trousers. Both men and women wore turbans. Kings and nobles usually had a store of costly garments for festive occasions(<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC3_4">Zechariah 3:4</span>) and for presents (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_22">Genesis 45:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET4_4">Esther 4:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET6_8,11">6:8, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_4">1 Samuel 18:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_5">2 Kings 5:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_22">10:22</span>). Prophets and ascetics wore coarse garments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_2">Isaiah 20:2</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC13_4">Zechariah 13:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_4">Matthew 3:4</span>).<br>
