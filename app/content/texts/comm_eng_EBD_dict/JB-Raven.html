Cant.<br>5:11); first mentioned as “sent forth” by Noah from the ark (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_7">Genesis 8:7</span>).<br>“Every raven after his kind” was forbidden as food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_15">Leviticus 11:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_14">Deuteronomy 14:14</span>). Ravens feed mostly on carrion, and hence their food is procured with difficulty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_41">Job 38:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS147_9">Psalm 147:9</span>). When they attack kids or lambs or weak animals, it is said that they first pick out the eyes of their victims (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_17">Proverbs 30:17</span>). When Elijah was concealed by the brook Cherith, God commanded the ravens to bring him “bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_3-6">1 Kings 17:3-6</span>). (See ELIJAH.) There are eight species of ravens in Palestine, and they are everywhere very numerous in that land.<br>
