(1.) the son of Jeduthum (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R125_3,9">1 Chronicles 25:3, 9</span>). (2.) The grandfather of the prophet Zephaniah, and the father of Cushi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_1">Zephaniah 1:1</span>). (3.) One of the Jewish nobles who conspired against Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR38_1">Jeremiah 38:1</span>). (4.) The son of Ahikam, and grandson of Shaphan, secretary of king Josiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR26_24">Jeremiah 26:24</span>). After the destruction of Jerusalem (see ZEDEKIAH), Nebuchadnezzar left him to govern the country as tributary to him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_22">2 Kings 25:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_5">Jeremiah 40:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR52_16">52:16</span>). Ishmael, however, at the head of a party of the royal family,“Jewish irreconcilables”, rose against him, and slew him and “all the Jews that were with him” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_2,3">Jeremiah 41:2, 3</span>) at Mizpah about three months after the destruction of Jerusalem. He and his band also plundered the town of Mizpah, and carried off many captives. He was, however, overtaken by Johanan and routed. He fled with such of his followers as escaped to the Ammonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_15">41:15</span>). The little remnant of the Jews now fled to Egypt.<br>
