In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_21">Judges 18:21</span> it means valuables, wealth, or booty. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS46_1">Isaiah 46:1</span> (R.V., “the things that ye carried about”) the word means a load for a beast of burden. In 1 Samuel 17:22 and <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS10_28">Isaiah 10:28</span> it is the rendering of a word (“stuff” in 1 Samuel 10:22) meaning implements, equipments, baggage. The phrase in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_15">Acts 21:15</span>, “We took up our carriages,” means properly, “We packed up our baggage,” as in the Revised Version.<br>
