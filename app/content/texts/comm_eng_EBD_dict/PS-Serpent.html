The poisonous character of the serpent is alluded to in Jacob’s blessing on Dan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_17">Genesis 49:17</span>; see <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_18,19">Proverbs 30:18, 19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM3_7">James 3:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR8_17">Jeremiah 8:17</span>). (See ADDER.) This word is used symbolically of a deadly, subtle, malicious enemy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_19">Luke 10:19</span>).<br>The serpent is first mentioned in connection with the history of the temptation and fall of our first parents (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_">Genesis 3</span>). It has been well remarked regarding this temptation: “A real serpent was the agent of the temptation, as is plain from what is said of the natural characteristic of the serpent in the first verse of the chapter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_1">3:1</span>), and from the curse pronounced upon the animal itself. But that Satan was the actual tempter, and that he used the serpent merely as his instrument, is evident (1) from the nature of the transaction; for although the serpent may be the most subtle of all the beasts of the field, yet he has not the high intellectual faculties which the tempter here displayed. (2.) In the New Testament it is both directly asserted and in various forms assumed that Satan seduced our first parents into sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM16_20">Romans 16:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_3,14">2 Corinthians 11:3, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV12_9">Revelation 12:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV20_2">20:2</span>).” Hodge’s System. Theol., ii. 127.<br>
