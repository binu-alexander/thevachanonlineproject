</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Corner" ><div class="is"><b>CORNER</b></div><br>"CORNER" The angle of a house (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_19">Job 1:19</span>) or a street (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_8">Proverbs 7:8</span>).<br>“Corners” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH9_22">Nehemiah 9:22</span> denotes the various districts of the promised land allotted to the Israelites. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_17">Numbers 24:17</span>, the “corners of Moab” denotes the whole land of Moab. The “corner of a field” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_9">Leviticus 19:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_22">23:22</span>) is its extreme part, which was not to be reaped. The Jews were prohibited from cutting the “corners,” i.e., the extremities, of the hair and whiskers running round the ears (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_27">Leviticus 19:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV21_5">21:5</span>). The “four corners of the earth” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_12">Isaiah 11:12</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK7_2">Ezekiel 7:2</span> denotes the whole land. The“corners of the streets” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_5">Matthew 6:5</span> means the angles where streets meet so as to form a square or place of public resort.<br>The corner gate of Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_13">2 Kings 14:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_9">2 Chronicles 26:9</span>) was on the north-west side of the city.<br>Corner-stone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_6">Job 38:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_16">Isaiah 28:16</span></span>), a block of great importance in binding together the sides of a building. The “head of the corner” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS118_22,23">Psalm 118:22, 23</span>) denotes the coping, the “coign of vantage”, i.e., the topstone of a building. But the word “corner stone” is sometimes used to denote some person of rank and importance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_16">Isaiah 28:16</span></span>). It is applied to our Lord, who was set in highest honour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_42">Matthew 21:42</span>). He is also styled “the chief corner stone” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_20">Ephesians 2:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P12_6-8">1 Peter 2:6-8</span>). When Zechariah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="P110_4">10:4</span>), speaking of Judah, says, “Out of him came forth the corner,” he is probably to be understood as ultimately referring to the Messiah as the“corner stone.” (See TEMPLE, SOLOMON’S.)
