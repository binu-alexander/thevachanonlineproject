A Chaldean God whose worship was introduced into Assyria by Pul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS46_1">Isaiah 46:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_1">Jeremiah 48:1</span>). To this idol was dedicated the great temple whose ruins are still seen at Birs Nimrud. A statue of Nebo found at Calah, where it was set up by Pul, king of Assyria, is now in the British Museum.<br>(2.) A mountain in the land of Moab from which Moses looked for the first and the last time on the Promised Land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_49">Deuteronomy 32:49</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_1">34:1</span>). It has been identified with Jebel Nebah, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea, near its northern end, and about 5 miles south-west of Heshbon. It was the summit of the ridge of Pisgah (q.v.), which was a part of the range of the“mountains of Abarim.” It is about 2,643 feet in height, but from its position it commands a view of Western Palestine. Close below it are the plains of Moab, where Balaam, and afterwards Moses, saw the tents of Israel spread along.<br>(3.) A town on the east of Jordan which was taken possession of and rebuilt by the tribe of Reuben (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_3,38">Numbers 32:3,38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_8">1 Chronicles 5:8</span>). It was about 8 miles south of Heshbon.<br>(4.) The “children of Nebo” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER2_29">Ezra 2:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_33">Nehemiah 7:33</span>) were of those who returned from Babylon. It was a town in Benjamin, probably the modern Beit Nubah, about 7 miles north-west of Hebron.<br>
