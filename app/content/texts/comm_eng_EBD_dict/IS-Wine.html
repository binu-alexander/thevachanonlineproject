The Greek word for wine is oinos, and the Latin vinun. But besides this common Hebrew word, there are several others which are thus rendered.<br>(1.) Ashishah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_19">2 Samuel 6:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R116_3">1 Chronicles 16:3</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_5">2:5</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_1">3:1</span></span>), which, however, rather denotes a solid cake of pressed grapes, or, as in the Revised Version, a cake of raisins.<br>(2.) ‘Asis, “sweet wine,” or “new wine,” the product of the same year(Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_2">8:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS49_26">Isaiah 49:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL1_5">Joel 1:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_18">3:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM9_13">Amos 9:13</span>), from a root meaning“to tread,” hence juice trodden out or pressed out, thus referring to the method by which the juice is obtained. The power of intoxication is ascribed to it.<br>(3.) Hometz. See VINEGAR.<br>(4.) Hemer, <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14">Deuteronomy 32:14</span></span> (rendered “blood of the grape”) <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS27_2">Isaiah 27:2</span> (“red wine”), <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER6_9">Ezra 6:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER7_22">7:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN5_1,2,4">Daniel 5:1, 2, 4</span>. This word conveys the idea of “foaming,” as in the process of fermentation, or when poured out.<br>It is derived from the root hamar, meaning “to boil up,” and also “to be red,” from the idea of boiling or becoming inflamed.<br>(5.) ‘Enabh, a grape (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_14">Deuteronomy 32:14</span></span>). The last clause of this verse should be rendered as in the Revised Version, “and of the blood of the grape [‘enabh] thou drankest wine [hemer].” In Hos. 3:1 the phrase in Authorized Version, “flagons of wine,” is in the Revised Version correctly“cakes of raisins.” (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_11">Genesis 49:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_3">Numbers 6:3</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_24">Deuteronomy 23:24</span>, etc., where this Hebrew word is rendered in the plural “grapes.”)(6.) Mesekh, properly a mixture of wine and water with spices that increase its stimulating properties (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_22">Isaiah 5:22</span>). <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8">Psalm 75:8</span></span>, “The wine[yayin] is red; it is full of mixture [mesekh];” <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_30"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_30">Proverbs 23:30</span></span>, “mixed wine;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS65_11">Isaiah 65:11</span>, “drink offering” (R.V., “mingled wine”).<br>(7.) Tirosh, properly “must,” translated “wine” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_51"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_51">Deuteronomy 28:51</span></span>);“new wine” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR3_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR3_10">Proverbs 3:10</span></span>); “sweet wine” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC6_15">Micah 6:15</span>; R.V., “vintage”).<br>This Hebrew word has been traced to a root meaning “to take possession of” and hence it is supposed that tirosh is so designated because in intoxicating it takes possession of the brain. Among the blessings promised to Esau (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_28">Genesis 27:28</span>) mention is made of “plenty of corn and tirosh.” Palestine is called “a land of corn and tirosh” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_28">Deuteronomy 33:28</span>; comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS36_17">Isaiah 36:17</span>). See also <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_51"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_51">Deuteronomy 28:51</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_28">2 Chronicles 32:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_19">Joel 2:19</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL4_11">4:11</span>, (“wine [yayin] and new wine [tirosh] take away the heart”).<br>(8.) Sobhe (root meaning “to drink to excess,” “to suck up,” “absorb”), found only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_22">Isaiah 1:22</span>, Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS4_18">4:18</span> (“their drink;” Gesen. and marg. of R.V., “their carouse”), and Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_10">1:10</span> (“drunken as drunkards;” lit.,“soaked according to their drink;” R.V., “drenched, as it were, in their drink”, i.e., according to their sobhe).<br>(9.) Shekar, “strong drink,” any intoxicating liquor; from a root meaning“to drink deeply,” “to be drunken”, a generic term applied to all fermented liquors, however obtained. <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_7">Numbers 28:7</span>, “strong wine” (R.V., “strong drink”). It is sometimes distinguished from wine, c.g., <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_9">Leviticus 10:9</span>, “Do not drink wine [yayin] nor strong drink [shekar];” <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_3">Numbers 6:3</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_4,7">Judges 13:4, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_7">Isaiah 28:7</span> (in all these places rendered “strong drink”). Translated“strong drink” also in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_11">Isaiah 5:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_9">24:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS29_9">29:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS56_12">56:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR20_1">Proverbs 20:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_6">31:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC2_11">Micah 2:11</span>.<br>(10.) Yekebh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_13">Deuteronomy 16:13</span>, but in R.V. correctly “wine-press”), a vat into which the new wine flowed from the press. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_24">Joel 2:24</span>, “their vats;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_13">3:13</span>, “the fats;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR3_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR3_10">Proverbs 3:10</span></span>, “Thy presses shall burst out with new wine [tirosh];” <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG2_16">Haggai 2:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_33">Jeremiah 48:33</span>, “wine-presses;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_27">2 Kings 6:27</span>; Job. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K224_11">24:11</span>.<br>(11.) Shemarim (only in plural), “lees” or “dregs” of wine. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS25_6">Isaiah 25:6</span> it is rendered “wines on the lees”, i.e., wine that has been kept on the lees, and therefore old wine.<br>(12.) Mesek, “a mixture,” mixed or spiced wine, not diluted with water, but mixed with drugs and spices to increase its strength, or, as some think, mingled with the lees by being shaken (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS75_8">Psalm 75:8</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_30"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_30">Proverbs 23:30</span></span>).<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_13">Acts 2:13</span> the word gleukos, rendered “new wine,” denotes properly“sweet wine.” It must have been intoxicating.<br>In addition to wine the Hebrews also made use of what they called debash, which was obtained by boiling down must to one-half or one-third of its original bulk. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_11">Genesis 43:11</span> this word is rendered “honey.” It was a kind of syrup, and is called by the Arabs at the present day dibs. This word occurs in the phrase “a land flowing with milk and honey” (debash), <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_8,17">Exodus 3:8, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_5">13:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX33_3">33:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_24">Leviticus 20:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_27">Numbers 13: 27</span>. (See HONEY.) Our Lord miraculously supplied wine at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN2_1-11">John 2:1-11</span>). The Rechabites were forbidden the use of wine(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR35_">Jeremiah 35</span>). The Nazarites also were to abstain from its use during the period of their vow (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_1-4">Numbers 6:1-4</span>); and those who were dedicated as Nazarites from their birth were perpetually to abstain from it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_4,5">Judges 13:4, 5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_15">Luke 1:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_33">7:33</span>). The priests, too, were forbidden the use of wine and strong drink when engaged in their sacred functions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_1,9-11">Leviticus 10:1, 9-11</span>).<br>“Wine is little used now in the East, from the fact that Mohammedans are not allowed to taste it, and very few of other creeds touch it. When it is drunk, water is generally mixed with it, and this was the custom in the days of Christ also. The people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates; a drunken person, in fact, is never seen”, (Geikie’s Life of Christ). The sin of drunkenness, however, must have been not uncommon in the olden times, for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the Bible.<br>A drink-offering of wine was presented with the daily sacrifice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_40,41">Exodus 29:40, 41</span>), and also with the offering of the first-fruits (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_13">Leviticus 23:13</span>), and with various other sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_5,7,10">Numbers 15:5, 7, 10</span>). Wine was used at the celebration of the Passover. And when the Lord’s Supper was instituted, the wine and the unleavened bread then on the paschal table were by our Lord set apart as memorials of his body and blood.<br>Several emphatic warnings are given in the New Testament against excess in the use of wine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_34">Luke 21:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM13_13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_18">Ephesians 5:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T13_8">1 Timothy 3:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT1_7">Titus 1:7</span>).<br>
