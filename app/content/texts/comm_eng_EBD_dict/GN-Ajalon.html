A town and valley originally assigned to the tribe of Dan, from which, however, they could not drive the Amorites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_35">Judges 1:35</span>). It was one of the Levitical cities given to the Kohathites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_69">1 Chronicles 6:69</span>). It was not far from Beth-shemesh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R228_18">2 Chronicles 28:18</span>). It was the boundary between the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, and is frequently mentioned in Jewish history (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R211_10">2 Chronicles 11:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_31">1 Samuel 14:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_13">1 Chronicles 8:13</span>). With reference to the valley named after the town, Joshua uttered the celebrated command, “Sun, stand thou still on Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_12">Joshua 10:12</span>). It has been identified as the modern Yalo, at the foot of the Beth-horon pass (q.v.). In the Tell Amarna letters Adoni-zedek (q.v.) speaks of the destruction of the “city of Ajalon” by the invaders, and describes himself as “afflicted, greatly afflicted” by the calamities that had come on the land, urging the king of Egypt to hasten to his help.<br>(2.) A city in the tribe of Zebulun (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG12_12">Judges 12:12</span>), the modern Jalun, three miles north of Cabul.<br>
