The son of Jabesh, otherwise unknown. He“conspired against Zachariah, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_10">2 Kings 15:10</span>). He reigned only “a month of days in Samaria” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_13">15:13</span>, marg.). Menahem rose up against Shallum and put him to death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_14,15,17">2 Kings 15:14, 15, 17</span>), and became king in his stead.<br>(2.) Keeper of the temple vestments in the reign of Josiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K222_14">2 Kings 22:14</span>).<br>(3.) One of the posterity of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_40,41">1 Chronicles 2:40, 41</span>).<br>(4.) A descendant of Simeon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_25">1 Chronicles 4:25</span>).<br>(5.) One of the line of the high priests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R16_13">1 Chronicles 6:13</span>).<br>(6.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_13">1 Chronicles 7:13</span>.<br>(7.) A keeper of the gate in the reign of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R19_17">1 Chronicles 9:17</span>).<br>(8.) A Levite porter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R19_19,31">1 Chronicles 9:19, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR35_4">Jeremiah 35:4</span>).<br>(9.) An Ephraimite chief (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R228_12">2 Chronicles 28:12</span>).<br>(10.) The uncle of the prophet Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR32_7">Jeremiah 32:7</span>).<br>(11.) A son of king Josiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_15">1 Chronicles 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_11">Jeremiah 22:11</span>), who was elected to succeed his father on the throne, although he was two years younger than his brother Eliakim. He assumed the crown under the name of Jehoahaz (q.v.). He did not imitate the example of his father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_32">2 Kings 23:32</span>), but was “a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK19_3">Ezekiel 19:3</span>). His policy was anti-Egyptian therefore. Necho, at that time at Riblah, sent an army against Jerusalem, which at once yielded, and Jehoahaz was carried captive to the Egyptian camp, Eliakim being appointed king in his stead. He remained a captive in Egypt till his death, and was the first king of Judah that died in exile.<br>
