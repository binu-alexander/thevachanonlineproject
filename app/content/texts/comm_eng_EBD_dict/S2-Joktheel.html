Amaziah, king of Judah, undertook a great expedition against Edom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_5-10">2 Chronicles 25:5-10</span>), which was completely successful. He routed the Edomites and slew vast numbers of them. So wonderful did this victory appear to him that he acknowledged that it could have been achieved only by the special help of God, and therefore he called Selah (q.v.), their great fortress city, by the name of Joktheel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_7">2 Kings 14:7</span>).<br>
