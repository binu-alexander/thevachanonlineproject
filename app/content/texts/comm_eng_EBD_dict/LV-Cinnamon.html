There is no trace of it in Egypt, and it was unknown in Syria. The inner rind when dried and rolled into cylinders forms the cinnamon of commerce. The fruit and coarser pieces of bark when boiled yield a fragrant oil. It was one of the principal ingredients in the holy anointing oil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_23">Exodus 30:23</span>). It is mentioned elsewhere only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR7_17">Proverbs 7:17</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR4_14">4:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV18_13">Revelation 18:13</span>. The mention of it indicates a very early and extensive commerce carried on between Palestine and the East.<br>
