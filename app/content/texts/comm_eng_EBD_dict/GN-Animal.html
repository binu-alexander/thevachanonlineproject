The Levitical law divided animals into clean and unclean, although the distinction seems to have existed before the Flood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_2">Genesis 7:2</span>). The clean could be offered in sacrifice and eaten. All animals that had not cloven hoofs and did not chew the cud were unclean. The list of clean and unclean quadrupeds is set forth in the Levitical law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_3-20">Deuteronomy 14:3-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_">Leviticus 11</span>).<br>
