The sin of drunkenness is frequently and strongly condemned(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM13_13">Romans 13:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_9,10">1 Corinthians 6:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP5_18">Ephesians 5:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H15_7,8">1 Thessalonians 5:7, 8</span>). The sin of drinking to excess seems to have been not uncommon among the Israelites.<br>The word is used figuratively, when men are spoken of as being drunk with sorrow, and with the wine of God’s wrath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS63_6">Isaiah 63:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_57">Jeremiah 51:57</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_33">Ezekiel 23:33</span>). To “add drunkenness to thirst” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_19">Deuteronomy 29:19</span>, A.V.) is a proverbial expression, rendered in the Revised Version“to destroy the moist with the dry”, i.e., the well-watered equally with the dry land, meaning that the effect of such walking in the imagination of their own hearts would be to destroy one and all.<br>
