A portable shield (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S222_31">2 Samuel 22:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_18">1 Chronicles 5:18</span>).<br>(2.) A shield surrounding the person; the targe or round form; used once figuratively (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_4">Psalm 91:4</span>).<br>(3.) A large shield protecting the whole body (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS35_2">Psalm 35:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_24">Ezekiel 23:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK26_8">26:8</span>).<br>(4.) A lance or spear; improperly rendered “buckler” in the Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_8">1 Chronicles 12:8</span>), but correctly in the Revised Version “spear.” The leather of shields required oiling (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_21">2 Samuel 1:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS21_5">Isaiah 21:5</span>), so as to prevent its being injured by moisture. Copper (= “brass”) shields were also in use (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_6">1 Samuel 17:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_27">1 Kings 14:27</span>). Those spoken of in 1 Kings 10:16, etc.; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_26">14:26</span>, were probably of massive metal.<br>The shields David had taken from his enemies were suspended in the temple as mementoes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K211_10">2 Kings 11:10</span>).
