If we reckon from the beginning of Jotham’s reign to the end of Hezekiah’s (B.C. 759-698), then he ministered for about fifty-nine years; but if we reckon from the death of Jotham to the accession of Hezekiah (B.C. 743-726), his ministry lasted only sixteen years. It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, “Micaiah the son of Imlah” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_28">1 Kings 22:28</span>): “Hearken, O people, every one of you.” The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke,“Hear ye,” etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people. The closing verse is quoted in the song of Zacharias (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_72,73">Luke 1:72, 73</span>). The prediction regarding the place “where Christ should be born,” one of the most remarkable Messianic prophecies(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC5_2">Micah <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_2">5:2</span></span>), is quoted in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6">Matthew 2:6</span></span>.<br>There are the following references to this book in the New Testament: 5:2, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT2_6">Matthew 2:6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_42">John 7:42</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_6">7:6</span>, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_21,35,36">Matthew 10:21,35,36</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT7_20">7:20</span>, with <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_72,73">Luke 1:72,73</span>.<br>
