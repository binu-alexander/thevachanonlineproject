This creative act on the part of God was absolutely free, and for infinitely wise reasons. The cause of all things exists only in the will of God. The work of creation is attributed (1) to the Godhead(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_1,26">Genesis 1:1, 26</span>); (2) to the Father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C18_6">1 Corinthians 8:6</span>); (3) to the Son(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_3">John 1:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_16,17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_16">Colossians 1:16</span>, 17</span>); (4) to the Holy Spirit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_2">Genesis 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB26_13">Job 26:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_30">Psalm 104:30</span>). The fact that he is the Creator distinguishes Jehovah as the true God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_16">Isaiah 37:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_12,13">40:12, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS54_5">54:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS96_5">Psalm 96:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR10_11,12">Jeremiah 10:11, 12</span>). The one great end in the work of creation is the manifestation of the glory of the Creator (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_16">Colossians 1:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV4_11">Revelation 4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM11_36">Romans 11:36</span>).<br>God’s works, equally with God’s word, are a revelation from him; and between the teachings of the one and those of the other, when rightly understood, there can be no contradiction.<br>Traditions of the creation, disfigured by corruptions, are found among the records of ancient Eastern nations. (See ACCAD.) A peculiar interest belongs to the traditions of the Accadians, the primitive inhabitants of the plains of Lower Mesopotamia. These within the last few years have been brought to light in the tablets and cylinders which have been rescued from the long-buried palaces and temples of Assyria. They bear a remarkable resemblance to the record of Genesis.<br>
