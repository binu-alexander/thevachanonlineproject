Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_12,27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_12">Acts 18:12</span>, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_21">19:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM15_26">Romans 15: 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM16_5">16:5</span>, etc.).<br>It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsular form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the “deputy,” i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_12">Acts 18:12</span>).<br>
