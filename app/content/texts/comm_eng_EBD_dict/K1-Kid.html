It was much used for food (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_9">Genesis 27:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_17">38:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_19">Judges 6:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_6">14:6</span>). The Mosaic law forbade to dress a kid in the milk of its dam, a law which is thrice repeated (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_19">Exodus 23:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_26">34:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_21">Deuteronomy 14:21</span>). Among the various reasons assigned for this law, that appears to be the most satisfactory which regards it as “a protest against cruelty and outraging the order of nature.” A kid cooked in its mother’s milk is “a gross, unwholesome dish, and calculated to kindle animal and ferocious passions, and on this account Moses may have forbidden it. Besides, it is even yet associated with immoderate feasting; and originally, I suspect,” says Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book), “was connected with idolatrous sacrifices.”
