In the popular sense of the word no mention is made either of witches or of witchcraft in Scripture.<br>The “witch of En-dor” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_">1 Samuel 28</span>) was a necromancer, i.e., one who feigned to hold converse with the dead. The damsel with “a spirit of divination” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_16">Acts 16:16</span>) was possessed by an evil spirit, or, as the words are literally rendered, “having a spirit, a pithon.” The reference is to the heathen God Apollo, who was regarded as the God of prophecy.<br>
