Hebrews hah, a “ring” inserted in the nostrils of animals to which a cord was fastened for the purpose of restraining them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_28">2 Kings 19:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS37_28,29">Isaiah 37:28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_4">Ezekiel 29:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK38_4">38:4</span>). “The Orientals make use of this contrivance for curbing their work-beasts...When a beast becomes unruly they have only to draw the cord on one side, which, by stopping his breath, punishes him so effectually that after a few repetitions he fails not to become quite tractable whenever he begins to feel it” (Michaelis). So God’s agents are never beyond his control.<br>(2.) Hakkah, a fish “hook” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB41_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB41_2">Job 41:2</span></span>, Hebrews Text, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB40_25">40:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS19_8">Isaiah 19:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HK1_15">Habakkuk 1:15</span>).<br>(3.)
