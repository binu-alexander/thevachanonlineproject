Parched grain was sometimes used for food without any other preparation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_14">Ruth 2:14</span>).<br>Bread was prepared by kneading in wooden bowls or “kneading troughs”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6">Genesis 18:6</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_34">Exodus 12:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR7_18">Jeremiah 7:18</span>). The dough was mixed with leaven and made into thin cakes, round or oval, and then baked. The bread eaten at the Passover was always unleavened (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_15-20">Exodus 12:15-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_3">Deuteronomy 16:3</span>). In the towns there were public ovens, which were much made use of for baking bread; there were also bakers by trade (Hos.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_4">7:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR37_21">Jeremiah 37:21</span>). Their ovens were not unlike those of modern times.<br>But sometimes the bread was baked by being placed on the ground that had been heated by a fire, and by covering it with the embers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_6">1 Kings 19:6</span>). This was probably the mode in which Sarah prepared bread on the occasion referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_6">Genesis 18:6</span></span>.<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span> there is an account of the different kinds of bread and cakes used by the Jews. (See BAKE.) The shew-bread (q.v.) consisted of twelve loaves of unleavened bread prepared and presented hot on the golden table every Sabbath. They were square or oblong, and represented the twelve tribes of Israel. The old loaves were removed every Sabbath, and were to be eaten only by the priests in the court of the sanctuary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_30">Exodus 25:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_">Leviticus 2</span>4:8; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_1-6">1 Samuel 21:1-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_4">Matthew 12:4</span>).<br>The word bread is used figuratively in such expressions as “bread of sorrows” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS127_2">Psalm 127:2</span>), “bread of tears” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS80_5">80:5</span>), i.e., sorrow and tears are like one’s daily bread, they form so great a part in life. The bread of“wickedness” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR4_17">Proverbs 4:17</span>) and “of deceit” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR20_17">20:17</span>) denote in like manner that wickedness and deceit are a part of the daily life.<br>
