The Hebrew word thus rendered, ’agalah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_7,8">1 Samuel 6:7, 8</span>), is also rendered “wagon” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_19">Genesis 45:19</span>). It is used also to denote a war-chariot(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS46_9">Psalm 46:9</span>). Carts were used for the removal of the ark and its sacred utensils (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU7_3,6">Numbers 7:3, 6</span>). After retaining the ark amongst them for seven months, the Philistines sent it back to the Israelites. On this occasion they set it in a new cart, probably a rude construction, with solid wooden wheels like that still used in Western Asia, which was drawn by two milch cows, which conveyed it straight to Beth-shemesh.<br>A “cart rope,” for the purpose of fastening loads on carts, is used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_18">Isaiah 5:18</span>) as a symbol of the power of sinful pleasures or habits over him who indulges them. (See CORD.) In Syria and Palestine wheel-carriages for any other purpose than the conveyance of agricultural produce are almost unknown.<br>
