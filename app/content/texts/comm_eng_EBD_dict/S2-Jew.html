But Paul was styled a Hebrew (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_22">2 Corinthians 11:22</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C23_5">3:5</span>).<br>The history of the Jewish nation is interwoven with the history of Palestine and with the narratives of the lives of their rulers and chief men.<br>They are now [1897] dispersed over all lands, and to this day remain a separate people, “without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image [R.V. ‘pillar,’ marg. ‘obelisk’], and without an ephod, and without teraphim” (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C23_4">3:4</span>). Till about the beginning of the present century [1800] they were everywhere greatly oppressed, and often cruelly persecuted; but now their condition is greatly improved, and they are admitted in most European countries to all the rights of free citizens. In 1860 the “Jewish disabilities” were removed, and they were admitted to a seat in the British Parliament. Their number in all is estimated at about six millions, about four millions being in Europe.<br>There are three names used in the New Testament to designate this people,(1.) Jews, as regards their nationality, to distinguish them from Gentiles.<br>(2.) Hebrews, with regard to their language and education, to distinguish them from Hellenists, i.e., Jews who spoke the Greek language. (3.) Israelites, as respects their sacred privileges as the chosen people of God.<br>“To other races we owe the splendid inheritance of modern civilization and secular culture; but the religious education of mankind has been the gift of the Jew alone.”
