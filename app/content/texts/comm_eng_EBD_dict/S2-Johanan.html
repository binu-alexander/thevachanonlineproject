One of the Gadite heroes who joined David in the desert of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_12">1 Chronicles 12:12</span>).<br>(2.) The oldest of King Josiah’s sons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_15">1 Chronicles 3:15</span>).<br>(3.) Son of Careah, one of the Jewish chiefs who rallied round Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had made governor in Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_23">2 Kings 25:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_8">Jeremiah 40:8</span>). He warned Gedaliah of the plans of Ishmael against him, a warning which was unheeded (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_13,16">Jeremiah 40:13, 16</span>). He afterwards pursued the murderer of the governor, and rescued the captives (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR41_8,13,15,16">41:8, 13, 15, 16</span>).<br>He and his associates subsequently fled to Tahpanhes in Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR43_2,4,5">43:2, 4, 5</span>), taking Jeremiah with them. “The flight of Gedaliah’s community to Egypt extinguished the last remaining spark of life in the Jewish state. The work of the ten centuries since Joshua crossed the Jordan had been undone.”
