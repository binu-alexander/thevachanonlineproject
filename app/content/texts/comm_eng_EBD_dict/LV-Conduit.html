The “conduit of the upper pool” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_3">Isaiah 7:3</span>) was formed by Hezekiah for the purpose of conveying the waters from the upper pool in the valley of Gihon to the west side of the city of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_17">2 Kings 18:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K220_20">20:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_30">2 Chronicles 32:30</span>).<br>In carrying out this work he stopped “the waters of the fountains which were without the city” i.e., “the upper water-course of Gihon”, and conveyed it down from the west through a canal into the city, so that in case of a siege the inhabitants of the city might have a supply of water, which would thus be withdrawn from the enemy. (See SILOAM.) There are also the remains of a conduit which conducted water from the so-called “Pools of Solomon,” beyond Bethlehem, into the city. Water is still conveyed into the city from the fountains which supplied these pools by a channel which crosses the valley of Hinnom.<br>
