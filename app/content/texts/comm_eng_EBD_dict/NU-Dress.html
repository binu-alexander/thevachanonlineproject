The earliest and simplest an apron of fig-leaves sewed together (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_7">Genesis 3:7</span>); then skins of animals (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_21">3:21</span>).<br>Elijah’s dress was probably the skin of a sheep (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K21_8">2 Kings 1:8</span>). The Hebrews were early acquainted with the art of weaving hair into cloth(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_7">Exodus 26:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_6">35:6</span>), which formed the sackcloth of mourners. This was the material of John the Baptist’s robe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT3_4">Matthew 3:4</span>). Wool was also woven into garments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV13_47">Leviticus 13:47</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11">Deuteronomy 22:11</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK34_3">Ezekiel 34:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB31_20">Job 31:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR27_26">Proverbs 27:26</span>). The Israelites probably learned the art of weaving linen when they were in Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_21">1 Chronicles 4:21</span>). Fine linen was used in the vestments of the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_5">Exodus 28:5</span>), as well as by the rich (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_42">Genesis 41:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_22">Proverbs 31:22</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_19">Luke 16:19</span></span>). The use of mixed material, as wool and flax, was forbidden (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_19">Leviticus 19:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_11">Deuteronomy 22:11</span></span>).<br>(2.) Colour. The prevailing colour was the natural white of the material used, which was sometimes rendered purer by the fuller’s art (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_1,2">Psalm 104:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS63_3">Isaiah 63:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_3">Mark 9:3</span>). The Hebrews were acquainted with the art of dyeing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_3,23">Genesis 37:3, 23</span>). Various modes of ornamentation were adopted in the process of weaving (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_6">Exodus 28:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX26_1,31">26:1, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_25">35:25</span>), and by needle-work (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_30">Judges <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR5_3">5:3</span>0</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_13">Psalm 45:13</span>). Dyed robes were imported from foreign countries, particularly from Phoenicia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_8">Zephaniah 1:8</span></span>). Purple and scarlet robes were the marks of the wealthy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_19">Luke 16:19</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_24">2 Samuel 1:24</span>).<br>(3.) Form. The robes of men and women were not very much different in form from each other.<br>(a) The “coat” (kethoneth), of wool, cotton, or linen, was worn by both sexes. It was a closely-fitting garment, resembling in use and form our shirt(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_23">John 19:23</span>). It was kept close to the body by a girdle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7">John 21:7</span></span>). A person wearing this “coat” alone was described as naked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_24">1 Samuel 19:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS20_2">Isaiah 20:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_30">2 Kings 6:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_7">John 21:7</span></span>); deprived of it he would be absolutely naked.<br>(b) A linen cloth or wrapper (sadin) of fine linen, used somewhat as a night-shirt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_51">Mark 14:51</span>). It is mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_12,13">Judges 14:12, 13</span>, and rendered there “sheets.”(c) An upper tunic (meil), longer than the “coat” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_19">1 Samuel 2:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_4">24:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_14">28:14</span>). In 1 Samuel 28:14 it is the mantle in which Samuel was enveloped; in 1 Samuel 24:4 it is the “robe” under which Saul slept. The disciples were forbidden to wear two “coats” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_10">Matthew 10:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_3">Luke 9:3</span>).<br>(d) The usual outer garment consisted of a piece of woollen cloth like a Scotch plaid, either wrapped round the body or thrown over the shoulders like a shawl, with the ends hanging down in front, or it might be thrown over the head so as to conceal the face (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_30"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_30">2 Samuel 15:30</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET6_12">Esther 6:12</span>). It was confined to the waist by a girdle, and the fold formed by the overlapping of the robe served as a pocket (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_39">2 Kings 4:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS79_12">Psalm 79:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG2_12">Haggai 2:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR17_23">Proverbs 17:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR21_14">21:14</span>).<br>Female dress. The “coat” was common to both sexes (Cant. 5:3). But peculiar to females were (1) the “veil” or “wimple,” a kind of shawl (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RT3_15">Ruth 3:15</span>; rendered “mantle,” R.V., <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span></span>); (2) the “mantle,” also a species of shawl (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_22">Isaiah 3:22</span></span>); (3) a “veil,” probably a light summer dress (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_65">Genesis 24:65</span>); (4) a “stomacher,” a holiday dress (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_24">Isaiah 3:24</span>). The outer garment terminated in an ample fringe or border, which concealed the feet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS47_2">Isaiah 47:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR13_22">Jeremiah 13:22</span>).<br>The dress of the Persians is described in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_21">Daniel 3:21</span>.<br>The reference to the art of sewing are few, inasmuch as the garments generally came forth from the loom ready for being worn, and all that was required in the making of clothes devolved on the women of a family(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_22">Proverbs 31:22</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_39">Acts 9:39</span>).<br>Extravagance in dress is referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_30">Jeremiah 4:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_10">Ezekiel 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_8">Zephaniah 1:8</span></span> (R.V., “foreign apparel”); <span class="bibleref" data-id="T12_9">1 Timothy 2:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P13_3">1 Peter 3:3</span>.<br>Rending the robes was expressive of grief (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_29,34">Genesis 37:29, 34</span>), fear (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_27">1 Kings 21:27</span>), indignation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_7">2 Kings 5:7</span>), or despair (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_35">Judges 11:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET4_1">Esther 4:1</span>).<br>Shaking the garments, or shaking the dust from off them, was a sign of renunciation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_6">Acts 18:6</span>); wrapping them round the head, of awe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_13">1 Kings 19:13</span>) or grief (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_30"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_30">2 Samuel 15:30</span></span>; casting them off, of excitement (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_23">Acts 22:23</span>); laying hold of them, of supplication (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_27">1 Samuel 15:27</span>). In the case of travelling, the outer garments were girded up (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_46">1 Kings 18:46</span>). They were thrown aside also when they would impede action (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_50">Mark 10:50</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN13_4">John 13:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_58">Acts 7:58</span>).<br>
