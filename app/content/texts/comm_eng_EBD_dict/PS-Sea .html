It was placed on the backs of twelve oxen, standing with their faces outward. It was capable of containing two or three thousand baths of water (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_5">2 Chronicles 4:5</span>), which was originally supplied by the Gibeonites, but was afterwards brought by a conduit from the pools of Bethlehem.
