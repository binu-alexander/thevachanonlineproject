No fish is mentioned by name either in the Old or in the New Testament. Fish abounded in the Mediterranean and in the lakes of the Jordan, so that the Hebrews were no doubt acquainted with many species. Two of the villages on the shores of the Sea of Galilee derived their names from their fisheries, Bethsaida (the “house of fish”) on the east and on the west.<br>There is probably no other sheet of water in the world of equal dimensions that contains such a variety and profusion of fish. About thirty-seven different kinds have been found. Some of the FISH FROM THE SEA OF GALILEE fishes are of a European type, such as the roach, the barbel, and the blenny; others are markedly African and tropical, such as the eel-like silurus. There was a regular fish-market apparently in Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R233_14">2 Chronicles 33:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_3">Nehemiah 3:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_39">12:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_10">Zephaniah 1:10</span>), as there was a fish-gate which was probably contiguous to it.<br>Sidon is the oldest fishing establishment known in history.<br>
