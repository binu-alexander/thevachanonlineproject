Here Paul, on his way to Rome, was met by a band of Roman Christians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_15">Acts 28:15</span>). The “Tres Tabernae was the first mansio or mutatio, that is, halting-place for relays, from Rome, or the last on the way to the city. At this point three roads run into the Via Appia, that from Tusculum, that from Alba Longa, and that from Antium; so necessarily here would be a halting-place, which took its name from the three shops there, the general store, the blacksmith’s, and the refreshment-house...Tres Tabernae is translated as Three Taverns, but it more correctly means three shops” (Forbes’s Footsteps of St. Paul, p.20).<br>
