Each tribe formed a battalion, with its own banner and leader (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_2">Numbers 2:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_14">10:14</span>). In war the army was divided into thousands and hundreds under their several captains(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_14">Numbers 31:14</span>), and also into families (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_34">Numbers 2:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_5">2 Chronicles 25:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_12">26:12</span>). From the time of their entering the land of Canaan to the time of the kings, the Israelites made little progress in military affairs, although often engaged in warfare. The kings introduced the custom of maintaining a bodyguard (the Gibborim; i.e., “heroes”), and thus the nucleus of a standing army was formed. Saul had an army of 3,000 select warriors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_2">1 Samuel 13:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_52">14:52</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S124_2">24:2</span>). David also had a band of soldiers around him (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_13">1 Samuel 23:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_13">25:13</span>). To this band he afterwards added the Cherethites and the Pelethites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_18">2 Samuel 15:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_7">20:7</span>). At first the army consisted only of infantry (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S14_10">1 Samuel 4:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_4">15:4</span>), as the use of horses was prohibited(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT17_16">Deuteronomy 17:16</span>); but chariots and horses were afterwards added (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_4">2 Samuel 8:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_26,28,29">1 Kings 10:26, 28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_19">1 Kings 9:19</span>). In 1 Kings 9:22 there is given a list of the various gradations of rank held by those who composed the army. The equipment and maintenance of the army were at the public expense (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_28,29">2 Samuel 17:28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_27">1 Kings 4:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_16,17">10:16, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_10">Judges 20:10</span>). At the Exodus the number of males above twenty years capable of bearing arms was 600,000 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_37">Exodus 12:37</span>). In David’s time it mounted to the number of 1,300,000 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_9">2 Samuel 24:9</span>).<br>
