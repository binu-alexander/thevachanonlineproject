The qualities of the resurrection body will be different from those of the body laid in the grave (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_53,54">1 Corinthians 15:53, 54</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_21">3:21</span></span></span>); but its identity will nevertheless be preserved. It will still be the same body (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_42-44">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</span>) which rises again.<br>As to the nature of the resurrection body, (1) it will be spiritual (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_44">1 Corinthians 15:44</span>), i.e., a body adapted to the use of the soul in its glorified state, and to all the conditions of the heavenly state; (2) glorious, incorruptible, and powerful (54); (3) like unto the glorified body of Christ(Phil. 3:21); and (4) immortal (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV21_4">Revelation 21:4</span>).<br>Christ’s resurrection secures and illustrates that of his people. “(1.) Because his resurrection seals and consummates his redemptive power; and the redemption of our persons involves the redemption of our bodies(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_23">Romans 8:23</span>). (2.) Because of our federal and vital union with Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_21,22">1 Corinthians 15:21, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H14_14">1 Thessalonians 4:14</span>). (3.) Because of his Spirit which dwells in us making our bodies his members (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C16_15">1 Corinthians 6:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM8_11">Romans 8:11</span>). (4.) Because Christ by covenant is Lord both of the living and the dead (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM14_9">Romans 14:9</span>). This same federal and vital union of the Christian with Christ likewise causes the resurrection of the believer to be similar to as well as consequent upon that of Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_49">1 Corinthians 15:49</span>; Phil. 3:21; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J13_2">1 John 3:2</span>).” Hodge’s Outlines of Theology.<br>
