The son and successor of Jehu, king of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_35">2 Kings 10:35</span>). He reigned seventeen years, and followed the evil ways of the house of Jeroboam. The Syrians, under Hazael and Benhadad, prevailed over him, but were at length driven out of the land by his son Jehoash (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_1-9,25">13:1-9, 25</span>).<br>(3.) Josiahâ€™s third son, usually called Shallum (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R13_15">1 Chronicles 3:15</span>). He succeeded his father on the throne, and reigned over Judah for three months (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_31,34">2 Kings 23:31, 34</span>). He fell into the idolatrous ways of his predecessors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_32">23:32</span>), was deposed by Pharaoh-Necho from the throne, and carried away prisoner into Egypt, where he died in captivity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_33,34">23:33, 34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR22_10-12">Jeremiah 22:10-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R236_1-4">2 Chronicles 36:1-4</span>).<br>
