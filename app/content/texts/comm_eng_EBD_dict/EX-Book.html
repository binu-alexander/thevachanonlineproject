In the Old Testament it is the rendering of the Hebrew word sepher, which properly means a “writing,” and then a “volume” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_14">Exodus 17:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_58">Deuteronomy 28:58</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_20">29:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB19_23">Job 19:23</span>) or “roll of a book” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_2,4">Jeremiah 36:2, 4</span>).<br>Books were originally written on skins, on linen or cotton cloth, and on Egyptian papyrus, whence our word “paper.” The leaves of the book were generally written in columns, designated by a Hebrew word properly meaning “doors” and “valves” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR36_23">Jeremiah 36:23</span>, R.V., marg. “columns”).<br>Among the Hebrews books were generally rolled up like our maps, or if very long they were rolled from both ends, forming two rolls (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK4_17-20">Luke 4:17-20</span>). Thus they were arranged when the writing was on flexible materials; but if the writing was on tablets of wood or brass or lead, then the several tablets were bound together by rings through which a rod was passed.<br>A sealed book is one whose contents are secret (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS29_11">Isaiah 29:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV5_1-3">Revelation 5:1-3</span>). To “eat” a book (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR15_16">Jeremiah 15:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK2_8-10">Ezekiel 2:8-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_1-3">3:1-3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV10_9">Revelation 10:9</span>) is to study its contents carefully.<br>The book of judgment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN7_10">Daniel 7:10</span>) refers to the method of human courts of justice as illustrating the proceedings which will take place at the day of God’s final judgment.<br>The book of the wars of the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_14">Numbers 21:14</span>), the book of Jasher(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_13">Joshua 10:13</span>), and the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_26">2 Chronicles 25:26</span>), were probably ancient documents known to the Hebrews, but not forming a part of the canon.<br>The book of life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS69_28">Psalm 69:28</span>) suggests the idea that as the redeemed form a community or citizenship (Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS3_20">3:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS4_3">4:3</span>), a catalogue of the citizens’ names is preserved (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_20">Luke 10:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV20_15">Revelation 20:15</span>). Their names are registered in heaven (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_20">Luke 10:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_5">Revelation 3:5</span>).<br>The book of the covenant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_7">Exodus 24:7</span>), containing <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX20_22-23">Exodus 20:22-23</span>:33, is the first book actually mentioned as a part of the written word. It contains a series of laws, civil, social, and religious, given to Moses at Sinai immediately after the delivery of the decalogue. These were written in this“book.”
