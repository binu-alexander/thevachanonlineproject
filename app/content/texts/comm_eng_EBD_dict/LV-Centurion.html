Cornelius, the first Gentile convert, was a centurion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_1,22">Acts 10:1, 22</span>). Other centurions are mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_5,8,13">Matthew 8:5, 8, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_2,6">Luke 7:2, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_32">Acts 21:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_25,26">22:25, 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_17,23">23:17, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC24_23">24:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_1,6,11,31,43">27:1, 6, 11, 31, 43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_16">28:16</span>. A centurion watched the crucifixion of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_54">Matthew 27:54</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_47">Luke 23:47</span>), and when he saw the wonders attending it, exclaimed, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” “The centurions mentioned in the New Testament are uniformly spoken of in terms of praise, whether in the Gospels or in the Acts. It is interesting to compare this with the statement of Polybius (vi. 24), that the centurions were chosen by merit, and so were men remarkable not so much for their daring courage as for their deliberation, constancy, and strength of mind.”, Dr. Maclear’s N. T. Hist.<br>
