This title is applied to Philip (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_8">Acts 21:8</span>), who appears to have gone from city to city preaching the word (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_4,40">8:4, 40</span>).<br>Judging from the case of Philip, evangelists had neither the authority of an apostle, nor the gift of prophecy, nor the responsibility of pastoral supervision over a portion of the flock. They were itinerant preachers, having it as their special function to carry the gospel to places where it was previously unknown. The writers of the four Gospels are known as the Evangelists.<br>
