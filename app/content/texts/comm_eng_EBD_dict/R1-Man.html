The name is derived from a word meaning “to be red,” and thus the first man was called Adam because he was formed from the red earth. It is also the generic name of the human race (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_26,27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_26,27">Genesis 1:26, 27</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN5_2">5:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_21">8:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT8_3">Deuteronomy 8:3</span>). Its equivalents are the Latin homo and the Greek anthropos(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_13,16">Matthew 5:13, 16</span>). It denotes also man in opposition to woman (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_12">Genesis 3:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_10">Matthew 19:10</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘ish, like the Latin vir and Greek aner, denotes properly a man in opposition to a woman (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_33">1 Samuel 17:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_21">Matthew 14:21</span>); a husband (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_16">Genesis 3:16</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_16">2:16</span>); man with reference to excellent mental qualities.<br>(3.) Hebrews ‘enosh, man as mortal, transient, perishable (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R214_11">2 Chronicles 14:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS8_1">Isaiah 8:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB15_14">Job 15:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS8_4">Psalm 8:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_19,20">9:19, 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS103_15">103:15</span>). It is applied to women (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS8_25">Joshua 8:25</span>).<br>(4.) Hebrews geber, man with reference to his strength, as distinguished from women (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_5">Deuteronomy 22:5</span>) and from children (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_37">Exodus 12:37</span>); a husband (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR6_34">Proverbs 6:34</span>).<br>(5.) Hebrews methim, men as mortal (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS41_14">Isaiah 41:14</span>), and as opposed to women and children (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_6">Deuteronomy 3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB11_3">Job 11:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_25">Isaiah 3:25</span>).<br>Man was created by the immediate hand of God, and is generically different from all other creatures (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_26,27"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_26,27">Genesis 1:26, 27</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_7">2:7</span>). His complex nature is composed of two elements, two distinct substances, viz., body and soul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_7">Genesis 2:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_7">Ecclesiastes 12:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_1-8">2 Corinthians 5:1-8</span>).<br>The words translated “spirit” and “soul,” in 1 Thessalonians 5:23, <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB4_12">Hebrews 4:12</span>, are habitually used interchangeably (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_28">Matthew 10:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_26">16:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_22">1 Peter 1:22</span>). The “spirit” (Gr. pneuma) is the soul as rational; the “soul”(Gr. psuche) is the same, considered as the animating and vital principle of the body.<br>Man was created in the likeness of God as to the perfection of his nature, in knowledge (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL3_10">Colossians 3:10</span>), righteousness, and holiness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_24">Ephesians 4:24</span>), and as having dominion over all the inferior creatures (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_28">Genesis 1:28</span>).<br>He had in his original state God’s law written on his heart, and had power to obey it, and yet was capable of disobeying, being left to the freedom of his own will. He was created with holy dispositions, prompting him to holy actions; but he was fallible, and did fall from his integrity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_1-6">3:1-6</span>). (See FALL.)
