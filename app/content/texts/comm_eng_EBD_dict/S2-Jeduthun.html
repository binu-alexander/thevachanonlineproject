He is called in 2 Chronicles 35:15 “the king’s seer.” His descendants are mentioned as singers and players on instruments(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_17">Nehemiah 11:17</span>). He was probably the same as Ethan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_17,19">1 Chronicles 15:17, 19</span>). In the superscriptions to <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS39_,62">Psalm 39, 62</span>, and 77, the words“upon Jeduthun” probably denote a musical instrument; or they may denote the style or tune invented or introduced by Jeduthun, or that the psalm was to be sung by his choir.<br>
