Chieftain or king of one of the Moabite tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_12-14">Judges 3:12-14</span>). Having entered into an alliance with Ammon and Amalek, he overran the trans-Jordanic region, and then crossing the Jordan, seized on Jericho, the “city of palm trees,” which had been by this time rebuilt, but not as a fortress. He made this city his capital, and kept Israel in subjection for eighteen years. The people at length “cried unto the Lord” in their distress, and he “raised them up a deliverer” in Ehud (q.v.), the son of Gera, a Benjamite.<br>(2.) A city in Judah, near Lachish (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_39">Joshua 15:39</span>). It was destroyed by Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_5,6">10:5, 6</span>). It has been identified with Tell Nejileh, 6 miles south of Tell Hesy or Ajlan, north-west of Lachish. (See LACHISH.)
