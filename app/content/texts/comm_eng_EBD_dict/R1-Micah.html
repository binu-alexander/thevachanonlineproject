A man of Mount Ephraim, whose history so far is introduced in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG17_">Judges 17</span>, apparently for the purpose of leading to an account of the settlement of the tribe of Dan in Northern Palestine, and for the purpose also of illustrating the lawlessness of the times in which he lived (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_">Judges 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG19_1-29">19:1-29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_25">21:25</span>).<br>(2.) The son of Merib-baal (Mephibosheth), <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_34,35">1 Chronicles 8:34, 35</span>.<br>(3.) The first in rank of the priests of the family of Kohathites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_20">1 Chronicles 23:20</span>).<br>(4.) A descendant of Joel the Reubenite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_5">1 Chronicles 5:5</span>).<br>(5.) “The Morasthite,” so called to distinguish him from Micaiah, the son of Imlah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_8">1 Kings 22:8</span>). He was a prophet of Judah, a contemporary of Isaiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC1_1">Micah 1:1</span>), a native of Moresheth of Gath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC1_14,15">1:14, 15</span>). Very little is known of the circumstances of his life (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR26_18,19">Jeremiah 26:18, 19</span>).<br>
