Their whole history and literature afford abundant evidence of this. After the Deluge, the first mention of music is in the account of Labanâ€™s interview with Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_27">Genesis 31:27</span>). After their triumphal passage of the Red Sea, Moses and the children of Israel sang their song of deliverance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_">Exodus 15</span>).<br>But the period of Samuel, David, and Solomon was the golden age of Hebrew music, as it was of Hebrew poetry. Music was now for the first time systematically cultivated. It was an essential part of training in the schools of the prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5">1 Samuel 10:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_19-24">19:19-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_15">2 Kings 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R125_6">1 Chronicles 25:6</span>). There now arose also a class of professional singers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S219_35">2 Samuel 19:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</span></span>). The temple, however, was the great school of music. In the conducting of its services large bands of trained singers and players on instruments were constantly employed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_5">2 Samuel 6:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_">1 Chronicles 15</span>; 16; 23;5; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R125_1-6">25:1-6</span>).<br>In private life also music seems to have held an important place among the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_4-6">Amos 6:4-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_11,12">Isaiah 5:11, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_8,9">24:8, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS137_">Psalm 137</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_33">Jeremiah 48:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_25">Luke 15:25</span>).<br>
