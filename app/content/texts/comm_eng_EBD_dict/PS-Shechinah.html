For references made to it during the wilderness wanderings, see <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_20">Exodus 14:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_34-38">40:34-38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV9_23,24">Leviticus 9:23, 24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_10">Numbers 14:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU16_19,42">16:19, 42</span>.<br>It is probable that after the entrance into Canaan this glory-cloud settled in the tabernacle upon the ark of the covenant in the most holy place. We have, however, no special reference to it till the consecration of the temple by Solomon, when it filled the whole house with its glory, so that the priests could not stand to minister (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_10-13">1 Kings 8:10-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R25_13,14">2 Chronicles 5:13, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R27_1-3">7:1-3</span>). Probably it remained in the first temple in the holy of holies as the symbol of Jehovah’s presence so long as that temple stood. It afterwards disappeared. (See CLOUD.)
