The name is found written in hieroglyphics in the temple of Kom Ombos in Upper Egypt. But the exact situation of Caphtor is unknown, though it is supposed to be Crete, since the Philistines seem to be meant by the “Cherethites” in 1 Samuel 30:14(see also 2 Samuel 8:18). It may, however, have been a part of Egypt, the Caphtur in the north Delta, since the Caphtorim were of the same race as the Mizraite people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_14">Genesis 10:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R11_12">1 Chronicles 1:12</span>).<br>
