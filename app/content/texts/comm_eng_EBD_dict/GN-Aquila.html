Along with his wife Priscilla he had fled from Rome in consequence of a decree (A.D. 50) by Claudius commanding all Jews to leave the city. Paul sojourned with him at Corinth, and they wrought together at their common trade, making Cilician hair-cloth for tents. On Paul’s departure from Corinth after eighteen months, Aquila and his wife accompanied him to Ephesus, where they remained, while he proceeded to Syria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_18,26">Acts 18:18, 26</span>). When they became Christians we are not informed, but in Ephesus they were (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C116_19">1 Corinthians 16:19</span>) Paul’s “helpers in Christ Jesus.” We find them afterwards at Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM16_3">Romans 16:3</span>), interesting themselves still in the cause of Christ. They are referred to some years after this as being at Ephesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_19">2 Timothy 4:19</span>). This is the last notice we have of them.<br>
