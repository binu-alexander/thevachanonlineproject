Hebrews Jehovah, has been rendered in the English Bible LORD, printed in small capitals. This is the proper name of the God of the Hebrews. The form “Jehovah” is retained only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_3">Exodus 6:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS83_18">Psalm 83:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS12_2">Isaiah 12:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS26_4">26:4</span>, both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘adon, means one possessed of absolute control. It denotes a master, as of slaves (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_14,27">Genesis 24:14, 27</span>), or a ruler of his subjects (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_8">45:8</span>), or a husband, as Lord of his wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_12">18:12</span>).<br>The old plural form of this Hebrew word is ’adonai. From a superstitious reverence for the name “Jehovah,” the Jews, in reading their Scriptures, whenever that name occurred, always pronounced it ’Adonai.<br>(3.) Greek kurios, a supreme master, etc. In the LXX. this is invariably used for “Jehovah” and “‘Adonai.”(4.) Hebrews ba’al, a master, as having domination. This word is applied to human relations, as that of husband, to persons skilled in some art or profession, and to heathen deities. “The men of Shechem,” literally “the baals of Shechem” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_2,3">Judges 9:2, 3</span>). These were the Israelite inhabitants who had reduced the Canaanites to a condition of vassalage (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS16_10">Joshua 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS17_13">17:13</span>).<br>(5.) Hebrews seren, applied exclusively to the “lords of the Philistines”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_3">Judges 3:3</span>). The LXX. render it by satrapies. At this period the Philistines were not, as at a later period (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10">1 Samuel 21:10</span>), under a kingly government. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_3">Joshua 13:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_18">1 Samuel 6:18</span>.) There were five such lordships, viz., Gath, Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron.<br>
