This was the “cave of the field of Machpelah,” where also Abraham and Rebekah and Jacob and Leah were burried (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN79_29-32">79:29-32</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_16">Acts 7:16</span></span> it is said that Jacob was “laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.” It has been proposed, as a mode of reconciling the apparent discrepancy between this verse and <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN23_20">Genesis 23:20</span></span>, to read <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_16">Acts 7:16</span></span> thus: “And they [i.e., our fathers] were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor [the son] of Sychem.” In this way the purchase made by Abraham is not to be confounded with the purchase made by Jacob subsequently in the same district. Of this purchase by Abraham there is no direct record in the Old Testament. (See TOMB.)
