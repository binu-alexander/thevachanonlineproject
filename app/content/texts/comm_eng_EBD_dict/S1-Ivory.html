It was used by the Phoenicians to ornament the box-wood rowing-benches of their galleys, and Hiram’s skilled workmen made Solomon’s throne of ivory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_18">1 Kings 10:18</span>). It was brought by the caravans of Dedan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS21_13">Isaiah 21:13</span>), and from the East Indies by the navy of Tarshish (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_22">1 Kings 10:22</span>). Many specimens of ancient Egyptian and Assyrian ivory-work have been preserved. The word habbim is derived from the Sanscrit ibhas, meaning “elephant,” preceded by the Hebrew article (ha); and hence it is argued that Ophir, from which it and the other articles mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_22">1 Kings 10:22</span> were brought, was in India.<br>
