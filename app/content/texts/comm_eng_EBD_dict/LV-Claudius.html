In this edict the Christians were included, as being, as was supposed, a sect of Jews. The Jews, however soon again returned to Rome.<br>During the reign of this emperor, several persecutions of the Christians by the Jews took place in the dominions of Herod Agrippa, in one of which the apostle James was “killed” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_2">12:2</span>).
