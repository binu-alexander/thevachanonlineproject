Shamgar slew six hundred Philistines with an ox-goad. “The goad is a formidable weapon. It is sometimes ten feet long, and has a sharp point. We could now see that the feat of Shamgar was not so very wonderful as some have been accustomed to think.” In 1 Samuel 13:21, a different Hebrew word is used, dorban, meaning something pointed. The expression (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_5">Acts 9:5</span>, omitted in the R.V.), “It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks”, i.e., against the goad, was proverbial for unavailing resistance to superior power.<br>
