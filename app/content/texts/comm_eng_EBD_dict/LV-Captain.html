Hebrews sar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_2">1 Samuel 22:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_19">2 Samuel 23:19</span>). Rendered“chief,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN40_2">Genesis 40:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_9">41:9</span>; rendered also “prince,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN1_7">Daniel 1:7</span>; “ruler,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_30">Judges 9:30</span>; “governor,’ <span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_26">1 Kings 22:26</span>. This same Hebrew word denotes a military captain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX18_21">Exodus 18:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K21_9">2 Kings 1:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_15">Deuteronomy 1:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_13">1 Samuel 18:13</span>, etc.), the “captain of the body-guard” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_36">Genesis 37:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN39_1">39:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_10">41:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_1">Jeremiah 40:1</span>), or, as the word may be rendered, “chief of the executioners” (marg.). The officers of the king’s body-guard frequently acted as executioners. Nebuzar-adan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_13">Jeremiah 39:13</span>) and Arioch (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_14">Daniel 2:14</span>) held this office in Babylon.<br>The “captain of the guard” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_16">Acts 28:16</span> was the Praetorian prefect, the commander of the Praetorian troops.<br>(2.) Another word (Hebrews katsin) so translated denotes sometimes a military (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_24">Joshua 10:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_6,11">Judges 11:6, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_3">Isaiah 22:3</span> “rulers;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN11_18">Daniel 11:18</span>) and sometimes a civil command, a judge, magistrate, Arab. kady, (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_10">Isaiah 1:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_6">3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC3_1,9">Micah 3:1, 9</span>).<br>(3.) It is also the rendering of a Hebrew word (shalish) meaning “a third man,” or “one of three.” The LXX. render in plural by tristatai; i.e.,“soldiers fighting from chariots,” so called because each war-chariot contained three men, one of whom acted as charioteer while the other two fought (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_7">Exodus 14:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_4">15:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_22">1 Kings 9:22</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_25">2 Kings 9:25</span>). This word is used also to denote the king’s body-guard (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_25">2 Kings 10:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_18">1 Chronicles 12:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R211_11">2 Chronicles 11:11</span>) or aides-de-camp.<br>(4.) The “captain of the temple” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_1">Acts 4:1</span> and 5:24 was not a military officer, but superintendent of the guard of priests and Levites who kept watch in the temple by night. (Comp. “the ruler of the house of God,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="R19_11">1 Chronicles 9:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_13">2 Chronicles 31:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_11">Nehemiah 11:11</span>.)(5.) The Captain of our salvation is a name given to our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_10">Hebrews 2:10</span>), because he is the author and source of our salvation, the head of his people, whom he is conducting to glory. The “captain of the Lord’s host”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_14,15">Joshua 5:14, 15</span>) is the name given to that mysterious person who manifested himself to Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_7">Genesis 12:7</span>), and to Moses in the bush(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_2,6">Exodus 3:2, 6</span>, etc.) the Angel of the covenant. (See ANGEL.)
