It contained latterly a large number of Jews, who were introduced into the city by Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, because he thought they would contribute to the security of the place.<br>They increased in number and influence; and we are thus prepared for the frequent references to them in connection with the early history of Christianity. Simon, who bore our Lord’s cross, was a native of this place(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_32">Matthew 27:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_21">Mark 15:21</span>). Jews from Cyrene were in Jerusalem at Pentecost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_10">Acts 2:10</span>); and Cyrenian Jews had a synagogue at Jerusalem(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_9">6:9</span>). Converts belonging to Cyrene contributed to the formation of the first Gentile church at Antioch (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_20">11:20</span>). Among “the prophets and teachers” who “ministered to the Lord at Antioch” was Lucius of Cyrene(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_1">13:1</span>).<br>
