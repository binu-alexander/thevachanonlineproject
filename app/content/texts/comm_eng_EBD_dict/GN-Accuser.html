Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_6">Job 1:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC3_1">Zechariah 3:1</span>), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered“accuser,” is found in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_10">John 8:10</span> (but omitted in the Revised Version); <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC23_30,35">Acts 23:30, 35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC24_8">24:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC25_16,18">25:16, 18</span>, in all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge against another.<br>
