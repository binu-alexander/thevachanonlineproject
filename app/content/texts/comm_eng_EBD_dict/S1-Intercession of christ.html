Thus he pleads for and obtains the fulfilment of all the promises of the everlasting covenant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="J12_1">1 John 2:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN17_24">John 17:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB7_25">Hebrews 7:25</span>). He can be “touched with the feeling of our infirmities,” and is both a merciful and a faithful high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB2_17,18">Hebrews 2:17, 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB4_15,16">4:15, 16</span>). This intercession is an essential part of his mediatorial work. Through him we have “access” to the Father (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_6">John 14:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP2_18">Ephesians 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP3_12">3:12</span>). “The communion of his people with the Father will ever be sustained through him as mediatorial Priest” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS110_4">Psalm 110:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV7_17">Revelation 7:17</span>).<br>
