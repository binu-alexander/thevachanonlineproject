She was seduced by Shechem, the son of Hamor, the Hivite chief, when Jacob’s camp was in the neighbourhood of Shechem. This led to the terrible revenge of Simeon and Levi in putting the Shechemites to death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_">Genesis 34</span>). Jacob makes frequent reference to this deed of blood with abhorrence and regret (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_">Genesis 34</span>:30; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_5-7">49:5-7</span>). She is mentioned among the rest of Jacob’s family that went down into Egypt(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_8,15">Genesis 46:8, 15</span>).<br>
