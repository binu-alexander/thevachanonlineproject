God “rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_27">Psalm 78:27</span>). The words in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_31"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_31">Numbers 11:31</span></span>, according to the Authorized Version, appear to denote that the quails lay one above another to the thickness of two cubits above the ground. The Revised Version, however, reads, “about two cubits above the face of the earth”, i.e., the quails flew at this height, and were easily killed or caught by the hand. Being thus secured in vast numbers by the people, they “spread them all abroad”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_32">11:32</span>) in order to salt and dry them.<br>These birds (the Coturnix vulgaris of naturalists) are found in countless numbers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and their annual migration is an event causing great excitement.<br>
