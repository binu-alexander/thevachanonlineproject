In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_27">Psalm 68:27</span> the word “council” means simply a company of persons. (R.V. marg., “company.”) In ecclesiastical history the word is used to denote an assembly of pastors or bishops for the discussion and regulation of church affairs. The first of these councils was that of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem, of which we have a detailed account in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_">Acts 15</span>.<br>
