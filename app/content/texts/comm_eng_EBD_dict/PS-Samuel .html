Samuel penned the first twenty-four chapters of the first book.<br>Gad, the companion of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_5">1 Samuel 22:5</span>), continued the history thus commenced; and Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the form in which we now have it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29">1 Chronicles 29:29</span>).<br>The contents of the books. The first book comprises a period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book, comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2) over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects.<br>The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as a sort of appendix recording various events, but not chronologically. These books do not contain complete histories. Frequent gaps are met with in the record, because their object is to present a history of the kingdom of God in its gradual development, and not of the events of the reigns of the successive rulers. It is noticeable that the section (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S211_2-12">2 Samuel 11:2-12</span>: 29) containing an account of David’s sin in the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chronicles 20.<br>
