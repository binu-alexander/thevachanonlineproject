It is the rendering of a word (rakad’) which means to skip or leap for joy, in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC3_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC3_4">Ecclesiastes 3:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB21_11">Job 21:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_21">Isaiah 13:21</span>, etc.<br>In the New Testament it is in like manner the translation of different Greek words, circular motion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_25">Luke 15:25</span>); leaping up and down in concert(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_17">Matthew 11:17</span>), and by a single person (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_6">Matthew 14:6</span></span>).<br>It is spoken of as symbolical of rejoicing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC3_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EC3_4">Ecclesiastes 3:4</span></span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS30_11"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS30_11">Psalm 30:11</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_17">Matthew 11: 17</span>). The Hebrews had their sacred dances expressive of joy and thanksgiving, when the performers were usually females(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20">Exodus 15:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_6">1 Samuel 18:6</span>).<br>The ancient dance was very different from that common among Western nations. It was usually the part of the women only (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20">Exodus 15:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_34">Judges 11:34</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_1">5:1</span>). Hence the peculiarity of David’s conduct in dancing before the ark of the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_14">2 Samuel 6:14</span>). The women took part in it with their timbrels. Michal should, in accordance with the example of Miriam and others, have herself led the female choir, instead of keeping aloof on the occasion and “looking through the window.” David led the choir“uncovered”, i.e., wearing only the ephod or linen tunic. He thought only of the honour of God, and forgot himself.<br>From being reserved for occasions of religious worship and festivity, it came gradually to be practised in common life on occasions of rejoicing(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_4">Jeremiah 31:4</span>). The sexes among the Jews always danced separately. The daughter of Herodias danced alone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_6">Matthew 14:6</span></span>).<br>
