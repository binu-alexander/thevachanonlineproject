In <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV18_13">Revelation 18:13</span> the word “slaves” is the rendering of a Greek word meaning “bodies.” The Hebrew and Greek words for slave are usually rendered simply “servant,” “bondman,” or “bondservant.” Slavery as it existed under the Mosaic law has no modern parallel. That law did not originate but only regulated the already existing custom of slavery (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_20,21,26,27">Exodus 21:20, 21, 26, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_44-46">Leviticus 25:44-46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_6-27">Joshua 9:6-27</span>). The gospel in its spirit and genius is hostile to slavery in every form, which under its influence is gradually disappearing from among men.<br>
