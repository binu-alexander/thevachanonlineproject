They had the right of gleaning the fields (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_9,10">Leviticus 19:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_19,21">Deuteronomy 24:19,21</span>).<br>(2.) In the sabbatical year they were to have their share of the produce of the fields and the vineyards (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_11">Exodus 23:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_6">Leviticus 25:6</span>).<br>(3.) In the year of jubilee they recovered their property (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_25-30">Leviticus 25:25-30</span>).<br>(4.) Usury was forbidden, and the pledged raiment was to be returned before the sun went down (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_25-27">Exodus 22:25-27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT24_10-13">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</span>).<br>The rich were to be generous to the poor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT15_7-11">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</span>).<br>(5.) In the sabbatical and jubilee years the bond-servant was to go free(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT15_12-15">Deuteronomy 15:12-15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_39-42,47-54">Leviticus 25:39-42, 47-54</span>).<br>(6.) Certain portions from the tithes were assigned to the poor(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT14_28,29">Deuteronomy 14:28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT26_12,13">26:12, 13</span>).<br>(7.) They shared in the feasts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_11,14">Deuteronomy 16:11, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_10">Nehemiah 8:10</span>).<br>(8.) Wages were to be paid at the close of each day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_13">Leviticus 19:13</span>).<br>In the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_11">Luke 3:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK14_13">14:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_1">Acts 6:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_10">Galatians 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_15,16">James 2:15, 16</span>) we have similar injunctions given with reference to the poor.<br>Begging was not common under the Old Testament, while it was so in the New Testament times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_20,21">Luke 16:20, 21</span>, etc.). But begging in the case of those who are able to work is forbidden, and all such are enjoined to “work with their own hands” as a Christian duty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H14_11">1 Thessalonians 4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H23_7-13">2 Thessalonians 3:7-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP4_28">Ephesians 4:28</span>). This word is used figuratively in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_3">Matthew 5:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_20">Luke 6:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C28_9">2 Corinthians 8:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV3_17">Revelation 3:17</span>.<br>
