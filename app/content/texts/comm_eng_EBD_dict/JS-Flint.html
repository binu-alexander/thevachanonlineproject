In <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS50_7">Isaiah 50:7</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_9">Ezekiel 3:9</span> the expressions, where the word is used, means that the “Messiah would be firm and resolute amidst all contempt and scorn which he would meet; that he had made up his mind to endure it, and would not shrink from any kind or degree of suffering which would be necessary to accomplish the great work in which he was engaged.” (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_8,9">Ezekiel 3:8, 9</span>.) The words “like a flint” are used with reference to the hoofs of horses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_28">Isaiah 5:28</span>).<br>
