These strangers (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK17_18">Luke 17:18</span>) amalgamated with the Jews still remaining in the land, and gradually abandoned their old idolatry and adopted partly the Jewish religion.<br>After the return from the Captivity, the Jews in Jerusalem refused to allow them to take part with them in rebuilding the temple, and hence sprang up an open enmity between them. They erected a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, which was, however, destroyed by a Jewish king (B.C. 130).<br>They then built another at Shechem. The bitter enmity between the Jews and Samaritans continued in the time of our Lord: the Jews had “no dealings with the Samaritans” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_9">John 4:9</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_52,53">Luke 9:52, 53</span>). Our Lord was in contempt called “a Samaritan” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_48">John 8:48</span>). Many of the Samaritans early embraced the gospel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN4_5-42">John 4:5-42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_25">Acts 8:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_31">9:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_3">15:3</span>). Of these Samaritans there still remains a small population of about one hundred and sixty, who all reside in Shechem, where they carefully observe the religious customs of their fathers. They are the “smallest and oldest sect in the world.”
