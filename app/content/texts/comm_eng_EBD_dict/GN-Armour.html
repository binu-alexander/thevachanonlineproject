The offensive weapons were different at different periods of history.<br>The “rod of iron” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS2_9">Psalm 2:9</span>) is supposed to mean a mace or crowbar, an instrument of great power when used by a strong arm. The “maul”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR25_18">Proverbs 25:18</span>; cognate Hebrew word rendered “battle-axe” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_20">Jeremiah 51:20</span>, and “slaughter weapon” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK9_2">Ezekiel 9:2</span>) was a war-hammer or martel. The “sword” is the usual translation of hereb, which properly means “poniard.” The real sword, as well as the dirk-sword (which was always double-edged), was also used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_39">1 Samuel 17:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_8">2 Samuel 20:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K120_11">1 Kings 20:11</span>). The spear was another offensive weapon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS8_18">Joshua 8:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_7">1 Samuel 17:7</span></span>). The javelin was used by light troops (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_7,8">Numbers 25:7, 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_22">1 Samuel 13:22</span>). Saul threw a javelin at David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_9,10">1 Samuel 19:9, 10</span>), and so virtually absolved him from his allegiance. The bow was, however, the chief weapon of offence. The arrows were carried in a quiver, the bow being always unbent till the moment of action (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN27_3">Genesis 27:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN48_22">48:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_34">Psalm 18:34</span>). The sling was a favourite weapon of the Benjamites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_40">1 Samuel 17:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_2">1 Chronicles 12:2</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_29">1 Samuel 25:29</span>).<br>(2.) Of the defensive armour a chief place is assigned to the shield or buckler. There were the great shield or target (the tzinnah), for the protection of the whole person (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_1">Genesis 15:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS47_9">Psalm 47:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_7">1 Samuel 17:7</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_5">Proverbs 30:5</span>), and the buckler (Hebrews mageen) or small shield (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_17">1 Kings 10:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK26_8">Ezekiel 26:8</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_4">Psalm 91:4</span> “buckler” is properly a roundel appropriated to archers or slingers. The helmet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_10">Ezekiel 27:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_38">1 Samuel 17:38</span>), a covering for the head; the coat of mail or corselet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_5">1 Samuel 17:5</span>), or habergeon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH4_">Nehemiah 4</span>;16), harness or breat-plate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV9_9">Revelation 9:9</span>), for the covering of the back and breast and both upper arms (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS59_17">Isaiah 59:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_14">Ephesians 6:14</span>). The cuirass and corselet, composed of leather or quilted cloth, were also for the covering of the body. Greaves, for the covering of the legs, were worn in the time of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_6">1 Samuel 17:6</span>). Reference is made by Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_14">Ephesians 6:14</span>-17) to the panoply of a Roman soldier. The shield here is the thureon, a door-like oblong shield above all, i.e., covering the whole person, not the small round shield. There is no armour for the back, but only for the front.<br>
