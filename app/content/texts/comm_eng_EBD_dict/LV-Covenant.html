</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Covenant" ><div class="is"><b>COVENANT</b></div><br>"COVENANT "a contract or agreement between two parties. In the Old Testament the Hebrew word berith is always thus translated. Berith is derived from a root which means “to cut,” and hence a covenant is a“cutting,” with reference to the cutting or dividing of animals into two parts, and the contracting parties passing between them, in making a covenant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_">Genesis 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR34_18,19">Jeremiah 34:18, 19</span>).<br>The corresponding word in the New Testament Greek is diatheke, which is, however, rendered “testament” generally in the Authorized Version. It ought to be rendered, just as the word berith of the Old Testament,“covenant.” This word is used (1) of a covenant or compact between man and man(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_32">Genesis 21:32</span>), or between tribes or nations (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_1">1 Samuel 11:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_6,15">Joshua 9:6, 15</span>). In entering into a convenant, Jehovah was solemnly called on to witness the transaction (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_50">Genesis 31:50</span>), and hence it was called a“covenant of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S120_8">1 Samuel 20:8</span>). The marriage compact is called“the covenant of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR2_17">Proverbs 2:17</span>), because the marriage was made in God’s name. Wicked men are spoken of as acting as if they had made a“covenant with death” not to destroy them, or with hell not to devour them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS28_15,18">Isaiah 28:15, 18</span>).<br>(2.) The word is used with reference to God’s revelation of himself in the way of promise or of favour to men. Thus God’s promise to Noah after the Flood is called a covenant (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_">Genesis 9</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_20">Jeremiah 33:20</span></span>, “my covenant”).<br>We have an account of God’s covernant with Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_">Genesis 17</span>, comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_42">Leviticus 26:42</span>), of the covenant of the priesthood (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_12,13">Numbers 25:12, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT33_9">Deuteronomy 33:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH13_29">Nehemiah 13:29</span>), and of the covenant of Sinai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_27,28">Exodus 34:27, 28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV26_15">Leviticus 26:15</span>), which was afterwards renewed at different times in the history of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_">Deuteronomy 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS1_24">Joshua 1:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R215_">2 Chronicles 15</span>; 23; 29; 34; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER10_">Ezra 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH9_">Nehemiah 9</span>). In conformity with human custom, God’s covenant is said to be confirmed with an oath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_31">Deuteronomy 4:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3">Psalm 89:3</span></span>), and to be accompanied by a sign (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_">Genesis 9</span></span>; 17). Hence the covenant is called God’s “counsel,” “oath,” “promise” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3">Psalm 89:3</span></span>, 4; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS105_8-11">105:8-11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB6_13-20">Hebrews 6:13-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_68-75">Luke 1:68-75</span>). God’s covenant consists wholly in the bestowal of blessing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS59_21">Isaiah 59:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_33,34"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_33">Jeremiah 31:33</span>, 34</span>).<br>The term covenant is also used to designate the regular succession of day and night (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_20">Jeremiah 33:20</span></span>), the Sabbath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX31_16">Exodus 31:16</span>), circumcision(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_">Genesis 17</span>:9, 10), and in general any ordinance of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR34_13,14">Jeremiah 34:13, 14</span>).<br>A “covenant of salt” signifies an everlasting covenant, in the sealing or ratifying of which salt, as an emblem of perpetuity, is used (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_19">Numbers 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_13">Leviticus 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R213_5">2 Chronicles 13:5</span>).<br>COVENANT OF WORKS, the constitution under which Adam was placed at his creation. In this covenant, (1.) The contracting parties were(a) God the moral Governor, and (b) Adam, a free moral agent, and representative of all his natural posterity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM5_12-19">Romans 5:12-19</span>). (2.) The promise was “life” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_16,17">Matthew 19:16, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_12">Galatians 3:12</span>). (3.) The condition was perfect obedience to the law, the test in this case being abstaining from eating the fruit of the “tree of knowledge,” etc. (4.) The penalty was death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN2_16,17">Genesis 2:16, 17</span>).<br>This covenant is also called a covenant of nature, as made with man in his natural or unfallen state; a covenant of life, because “life” was the promise attached to obedience; and a legal covenant, because it demanded perfect obedience to the law.<br>The “tree of life” was the outward sign and seal of that life which was promised in the covenant, and hence it is usually called the seal of that covenant.<br>This covenant is abrogated under the gospel, inasmuch as Christ has fulfilled all its conditions in behalf of his people, and now offers salvation on the condition of faith. It is still in force, however, as it rests on the immutable justice of God, and is binding on all who have not fled to Christ and accepted his righteousness.<br>CONVENANT OF GRACE, the eternal plan of redemption entered into by the three persons of the Godhead, and carried out by them in its several parts. In it the Father represented the Godhead in its indivisible sovereignty, and the Son his people as their surety (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN17_4,6,9">John 17:4, 6, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_6">Isaiah 42:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_3">Psalm 89:3</span></span>).<br>The conditions of this covenant were, (1.) On the part of the Father (a) all needful preparation to the Son for the accomplishment of his work(<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB10_5">Hebrews 10:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_1-7">Isaiah 42:1-7</span>); (b) support in the work (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_43">Luke 22:43</span>); and(c) a glorious reward in the exaltation of Christ when his work was done(Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_6-11">2:6-11</span>), his investiture with universal dominion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN5_22">John 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS110_1">Psalm 110:1</span>), his having the administration of the covenant committed into his hands (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_18">Matthew 28:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_12">John 1:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN17_2">17:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_33">Acts 2:33</span>), and in the final salvation of all his people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS35_10">Isaiah 35:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS53_10,11">53:10, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_33">Jeremiah 31:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT1_2">Titus 1:2</span>). (2.) On the part of the Son the conditions were (a) his becoming incarnate (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL4_4,5">Galatians 4:4, 5</span>); and (b) as the second Adam his representing all his people, assuming their place and undertaking all their obligations under the violated covenant of works; (c) obeying the law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS40_8">Psalm 40:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_21">Isaiah 42:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN9_4,5">John 9:4, 5</span>), and (d) suffering its penalty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS53_">Isaiah 53</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_21">2 Corinthians 5:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL3_13">Galatians 3:13</span>), in their stead.<br>Christ, the mediator of, fulfils all its conditions in behalf of his people, and dispenses to them all its blessings. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB8_6">Hebrews 8:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB9_15">9:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB12_24">12:24</span>, this title is given to Christ.
