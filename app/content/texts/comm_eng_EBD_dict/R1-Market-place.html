This word occurs in the Old Testament only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_13">Ezekiel 27:13</span>.<br>In early times markets were held at the gates of cities, where commodities were exposed for sale (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K27_18">2 Kings 7:18</span>). In large towns the sale of particular articles seems to have been confined to certain streets, as we may infer from such expressions as “the bakers’ street” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR37_21">Jeremiah 37:21</span>), and from the circumstance that in the time of Josephus the valley between Mounts Zion and Moriah was called the Tyropoeon or the “valley of the cheesemakers.”
