The little round seeds were an emblem of any small insignificant object. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament; and in each of the three instances of its occurrence in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_31,32">Matthew 13:31, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK4_31,32">Mark 4:31, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK13_18,19">Luke 13:18, 19</span>) it is spoken of only with reference to the smallness of its seed. The common mustard of Palestine is the Sinapis nigra. This garden herb sometimes grows to a considerable height, so as to be spoken of as “a tree” as compared with garden herbs.<br>
