From this place Joab procured a “wise woman,” who pretended to be in great affliction, and skilfully made her case known to David. Her address to the king was in the form of an apologue, similar to that of Nathan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_1-6">2 Samuel 12:1-6</span>). The object of Joab was, by the intervention of this woman, to induce David to bring back Absalom to Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S214_2,4,9">2 Samuel 14:2, 4, 9</span>).<br>This was also the birth-place of the prophet Amos (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_1">1:1</span>).<br>It is now the village of Teku’a, on the top of a hill among ruins, 5 miles south of Bethlehem, and close to Beth-haccerem (“Herod’s mountain”).<br>
