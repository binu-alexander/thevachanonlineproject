Abraham sojourned here, and perhaps Isaac was born in this place. Both of these patriarchs were guilty of the sin of here denying their wives, and both of them entered into a treaty with the king before they departed to Beersheba (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_23-34">21:23-34</span>; 26). It seems to have been a rich pastoral country (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R214_12-18">2 Chronicles 14:12-18</span>). Isaac here reaped an hundred-fold, and was blessed of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_12">Genesis 26:12</span>). The“valley of Gerar” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_17">Genesis 26:17</span>) was probably the modern Wady el-Jerdr.<br>
