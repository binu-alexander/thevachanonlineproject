The exterior was usually whitewashed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV14_41">Leviticus 14:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK13_10">Ezekiel 13:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_27">Matthew 23:27</span>).<br>The beams were of sycamore (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_10">Isaiah 9:10</span></span>), or olive-wood, or cedar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_2">1 Kings 7:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_10">Isaiah 9:10</span></span>).<br>The form of Eastern dwellings differed in many respects from that of dwellings in Western lands. The larger houses were built in a quadrangle enclosing a court-yard (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_19">Luke 5:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_18">2 Samuel 17:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_16">Nehemiah 8:16</span>) surrounded by galleries, which formed the guest-chamber or reception-room for visitors. The flat roof, surrounded by a low parapet, was used for many domestic and social purposes. It was reached by steps from the court. In connection with it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12">2 Kings 23:12</span></span>) was an upper room, used as a private chamber (2 Sam 18:33; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN6_11">Daniel 6:11</span>), also as a bedroom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12">2 Kings 23:12</span></span>), a sleeping apartment for guests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10">2 Kings 4:10</span></span></span>), and as a sick-chamber (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_19">1 Kings 17:19</span>). The doors, sometimes of stone, swung on morticed pivots, and were generally fastened by wooden bolts. The houses of the more wealthy had a doorkeeper or a female porter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_16">John 18:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_13">Acts 12:13</span>). The windows generally opened into the courtyard, and were closed by a lattice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_28">Judges 5:28</span>). The interior rooms were set apart for the female portion of the household.<br>The furniture of the room (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10">2 Kings 4:10</span></span></span>) consisted of a couch furnished with pillows (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM6_4">Amos 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK13_20">Ezekiel 13:20</span>); and besides this, chairs, a table and lanterns or lamp-stands (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K24_10">2 Kings 4:10</span></span></span>).<br>
