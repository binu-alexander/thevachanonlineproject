Every Hebrew had a certain portion of land assigned to him as a possession (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_33-56">Numbers 26:33-56</span>). In Egypt the lands all belonged to the king, and the husbandmen were obliged to give him a fifth part of the produce; so in Palestine Jehovah was the sole possessor of the soil, and the people held it by direct tenure from him. By the enactment of Moses, the Hebrews paid a tithe of the produce to Jehovah, which was assigned to the priesthood. Military service when required was also to be rendered by every Hebrew at his own expense. The occuptaion of a husbandman was held in high honour (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_5-7">1 Samuel 11:5-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_19">1 Kings 19:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_10">2 Chronicles 26:10</span>).
