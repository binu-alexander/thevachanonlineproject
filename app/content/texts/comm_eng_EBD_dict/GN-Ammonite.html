From the very beginning (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_16-20">Deuteronomy 2:16-20</span>) of their history till they are lost sight of (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_2">Judges 5:2</span>), this tribe is closely associated with the Moabites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG10_11">Judges 10:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_1">2 Chronicles 20:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_8">Zephaniah 2:8</span></span>). Both of these tribes hired Balaam to curse Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_4">Deuteronomy 23:4</span>).<br>The Ammonites were probably more of a predatory tribe, moving from place to place, while the Moabites were more settled. They inhabited the country east of the Jordan and north of Moab and the Dead Sea, from which they had expelled the Zamzummims or Zuzims (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_20">Deuteronomy 2:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_5">Genesis 14:5</span>). They are known as the Beni-ammi (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_38"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_38">Genesis 19:38</span></span>), Ammi or Ammon being worshipped as their chief God. They were of Semitic origin, and closely related to the Hebrews in blood and language. They showed no kindness to the Israelites when passing through their territory, and therefore they were prohibited from “entering the congregation of the Lord to the tenth generation” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_3">Deuteronomy 23:3</span>). They afterwards became hostile to Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_13">Judges 3:13</span>). Jephthah waged war against them, and “took twenty cities with a very great slaughter” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG11_33">Judges 11:33</span>). They were again signally defeated by Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_11">1 Samuel 11:11</span>). David also defeated them and their allies the Syrians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_6-14">2 Samuel 10:6-14</span>), and took their chief city, Rabbah, with much spoil (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S210_14">2 Samuel 10:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_26-31">12:26-31</span>). The subsequent events of their history are noted in 2 Chronicles 20:25; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S226_8">26:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_1">Jeremiah 49:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_3,6">Ezekiel 25:3, 6</span>. One of Solomon’s wives was Naamah, an Ammonite.<br>She was the mother of Rehoboam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_31">1 Kings 14:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R212_13">2 Chronicles 12:13</span>).<br>The prophets predicted fearful judgments against the Ammonites because of their hostility to Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_8">Zephaniah 2:8</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR49_1">Jeremiah 49:1</span>-6; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_1-5,10">Ezekiel 25:1-5, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_13-15">Amos 1:13-15</span>).<br>The national idol worshipped by this people was Molech or Milcom, at whose altar they offered human sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K111_5,7">1 Kings 11:5, 7</span>). The high places built for this idol by Solomon, at the instigation of his Ammonitish wives, were not destroyed till the time of Josiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_13">2 Kings 23:13</span>).<br>
