It is one of the trees of which, because of its strength and beauty, the Assyrian empire is likened (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_8">Ezekiel 31:8</span>; R.V., “plane trees”). It is probably the Oriental plane tree (Platanus orientalis) that is intended. It is a characteristic of this tree that it annually sheds its outer bark, becomes“naked.” The chestnut tree proper is not a native of Palestine.<br>
