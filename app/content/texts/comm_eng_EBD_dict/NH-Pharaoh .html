The princess who adopted the infant Moses (q.v.), <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_10">Exodus 2:10</span>. She is twice mentioned in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC7_21">Acts 7:21</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_24">Hebrews 11:24</span>). It would seem that she was alive and in some position of influence about the court when Moses was compelled to flee from Egypt, and thus for forty years he had in some way been under her influence. She was in all probability the sister of Rameses, and the daughter of Seti I. Josephus calls her Thermuthis. It is supposed by some that she was Nefert-ari, the wife as well as sister of Rameses. The mummy of this queen was among the treasures found at Deir-el-Bahari.<br>(2.) “Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, which Mered took (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_18">1 Chronicles 4:18</span>).<br>(3.) The wife of Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K13_1">1 Kings 3:1</span>). This is the first reference since the Exodus to any connection of Israel with Egypt.<br>
