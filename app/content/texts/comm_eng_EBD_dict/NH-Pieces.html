In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_30">Psalm 68:30</span> denotes “fragments,” and not properly money. In 1 Samuel 2:36 (Hebrews agorah), properly a “small sum” as wages, weighed rather than coined. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS24_32">Joshua 24:32</span> (Hebrews kesitah, q.v.), supposed by some to have been a piece of money bearing the figure of a lamb, but rather simply a certain amount. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN33_19">Genesis 33:19</span>).<br>(2.) The word pieces is omitted in many passages, as <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN20_16">Genesis 20:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_28">37:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_22">45:22</span>, etc. The passage in <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC11_12,13">Zechariah 11:12, 13</span> is quoted in the Gospel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_15">Matthew 26:15</span>), and from this we know that the word to be supplied is “shekels.” In all these omissions we may thus warrantably supply this word.<br>(3.) The “piece of money” mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_27">Matthew 17:27</span> is a stater=a Hebrew shekel, or four Greek drachmae; and that in <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_8,9">Luke 15:8, 9</span>, Act 19:19, a Greek drachma=a denarius.
