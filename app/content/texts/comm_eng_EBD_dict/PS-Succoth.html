The first encampment of the Israelites after leaving Ramesses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_37">Exodus 12:37</span>); the civil name of Pithom (q.v.).<br>(2.) A city on the east of Jordan, identified with Tell Dar’ala, a high mound, a mass of debris, in the plain north of Jabbok and about one mile from it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_27">Joshua 13:27</span>). Here Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_17,30">Genesis 32:17, 30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN33_17">33:17</span>), on his return from Padan-aram after his interview with Esau, built a house for himself and made booths for his cattle. The princes of this city churlishly refused to afford help to Gideon and his 300 men when “faint yet pursuing” they followed one of the bands of the fugitive Midianites after the great victory at Gilboa. After overtaking and routing this band at Karkor, Gideon on his return visited the rulers of the city with severe punishment. “He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_13-16">Judges 8:13-16</span>).<br>At this place were erected the foundries for casting the metal-work for the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_46">1 Kings 7:46</span>).<br>
