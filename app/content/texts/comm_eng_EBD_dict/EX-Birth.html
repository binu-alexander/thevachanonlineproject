At the close of that period she entered into the tabernacle or temple and offered up a sacrifice of purification (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV12_1-8">Leviticus 12:1-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_22">Luke 2:22</span>). A son was circumcised on the eighth day after his birth, being thereby consecrated to God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_10-12">Genesis 17:10-12</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM4_11">Romans 4:11</span>). Seasons of misfortune are likened to the pains of a woman in travail, and seasons of prosperity to the joy that succeeds child-birth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_8">Isaiah 13:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_31">Jeremiah 4:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN16_21,22">John 16:21, 22</span>).<br>The natural birth is referred to as the emblem of the new birth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN3_3-8">John 3:3-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL6_15">Galatians 6:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT3_5">Titus 3:5</span>, etc.).<br>
