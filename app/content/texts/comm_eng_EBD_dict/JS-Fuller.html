This art is one of great antiquity. Mention is made of “fuller’s soap” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ML3_2">Malachi 3:2</span>), and of “the fuller’s field” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_17">2 Kings 18:17</span>). At his transfiguration our Lord’s rainment is said to have been white “so as no fuller on earth could white them” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_3">Mark 9:3</span>). En-rogel (q.v.), meaning literally “foot-fountain,” has been interpreted as the “fuller’s fountain,” because there the fullers trod the cloth with their feet.<br>
