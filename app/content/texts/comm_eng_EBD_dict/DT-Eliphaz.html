One of Job’s “three friends” who visited him in his affliction (4:1). He was a “Temanite”, i.e., a native of Teman, in Idumea. He first enters into debate with Job. His language is uniformly more delicate and gentle than that of the other two, although he imputes to Job special sins as the cause of his present sufferings. He states with remarkable force of language the infinite purity and majesty of God(4:12-21; 15:12-16).<br>(2.) The son of Esau by his wife Adah, and father of several Edomitish tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_4,10,11,16">Genesis 36:4, 10, 11, 16</span>).<br>
