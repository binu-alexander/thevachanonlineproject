In it he entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (comp. Phil. 2:22). He was anticipating that “the time of his departure was at hand” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_6">2 Timothy 4:6</span>), and he exhorts his “son Timothy” to all diligence and steadfastness, and to patience under persecution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_6-15">1:6-15</span>), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_1-5">4:1-5</span>), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of quick and dead.<br>
