(1.) He divided the priests into twenty-four courses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R124_1-19">1 Chronicles 24:1-19</span>), sixteen being of the house of Eleazar and eight of that of Ithamar. Each course was under a head or chief, and ministered for a week, the order being determined by lot. (2.) The rest of the 38,000 Levites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_4">23:4</span>) were divided also into twenty-four courses, each to render some allotted service in public worship: 4,000 in twenty-four courses were set apart as singers and musicians under separate leaders (25); 4,000 as porters or keepers of the doors and gates of the sanctuary (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R126_1-19">26:1-19</span>); and 6,000 as officers and judges to see to the administration of the law in all civil and ecclesiastical matters (20-32).<br>This arrangement was re-established by Hezekiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_2">2 Chronicles 31:2</span>); and afterwards the four sacerdotal courses which are said to have returned from the Captivity were re-divided into the original number of twenty-four by Ezra (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R26_18">6:18</span>).<br>
