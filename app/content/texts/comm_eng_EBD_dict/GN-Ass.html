Of the domesticated species we read of, (1.) The she ass (Hebrews ‘athon), so named from its slowness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16">Genesis 12:16</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN45_23">45:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_23">Numbers 22:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_3">1 Samuel 9:3</span>). (2.) The male ass (Hebrews hamor), the common working ass of Western Asia, so called from its red colour. Issachar is compared to a strong ass (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_14">Genesis 49:14</span>). It was forbidden to yoke together an ass and an ox in the plough(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT22_10">Deuteronomy 22:10</span>). (3.) The ass’s colt (Hebrews ‘air), mentioned <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG10_4">Judges 10:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG12_14">12:14</span>. It is rendered “foal” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_15">Genesis 32:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_11">49:11</span>. (Comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB11_12">Job <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB11_12">11:12</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS30_6">Isaiah 30:6</span>.) The ass is an unclean animal, because it does not chew the cud (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_26">Leviticus 11:26</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_25">2 Kings 6:25</span>). Asses constituted a considerable portion of wealth in ancient times (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_16">Genesis 12:16</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_43">30:43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_30">1 Chronicles 27:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_3">Job 1:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB42_12">42:12</span>). They were noted for their spirit and their attachment to their master (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_3">Isaiah 1:3</span>). They are frequently spoken of as having been ridden upon, as by Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_3">Genesis 22:3</span>), Balaam(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_21">Numbers 22:21</span>), the disobedient prophet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K113_23">1 Kings 13:23</span>), the family of Abdon the judge, seventy in number (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG12_14">Judges 12:14</span>), Zipporah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX4_20">Exodus 4:20</span>), the Shunammite (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_30">1 Samuel 25:30</span>), etc. Zechariah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_9">9:9</span>) predicted our Lord’s triumphal entrance into Jerusalem, “riding upon an ass, and upon a colt,” etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_5">Matthew 21:5</span>, R.V.).<br>Of wild asses two species are noticed, (1) that called in Hebrew ’arod, mentioned <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB39_5">Job 39:5</span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN5_21">Daniel 5:21</span>, noted for its swiftness; and (2) that called pe’re, the wild ass of Asia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB39_6-8">Job 39:6-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB6_5">6:5</span>; 11:12; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS32_14">Isaiah 32:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_24">Jeremiah 2:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR14_6">14:6</span>, etc.). The wild ass was distinguished for its fleetness and its extreme shyness. In allusion to his mode of life, Ishmael is likened to a wild ass (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN16_12">Genesis 16:12</span>. Here the word is simply rendered “wild” in the Authorized Version, but in the Revised Version, “wild-ass among men”).<br>
