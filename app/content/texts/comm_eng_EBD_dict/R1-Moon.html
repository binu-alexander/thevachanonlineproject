A lunation was among the Jews the period of a month, and several of their festivals were held on the day of the new moon. It is frequently referred to along with the sun (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_12">Joshua 10:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS72_5,7,17">Psalm 72:5, 7, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_36,37">89:36, 37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_2">Ecclesiastes 12:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_23"><span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_23">Isaiah 24:23</span></span>, etc.), and also by itself (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS8_3">Psalm 8:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS121_6">121:6</span>).<br>The great brilliance of the moon in Eastern countries led to its being early an object of idolatrous worship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_19">Deuteronomy 4:19</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT17_3"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT17_3">17:3</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB31_26">Job 31:26</span>), a form of idolatry against which the Jews were warned (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_19">Deuteronomy 4:19</span></span>; 17:3). They, however, fell into this idolatry, and offered incense (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_5">2 Kings 23:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR8_2">Jeremiah 8:2</span>), and also cakes of honey, to the moon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR7_18">Jeremiah 7:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR44_17-19,25">44:17-19, 25</span>).<br>
