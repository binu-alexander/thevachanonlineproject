The Israelites were known in Egypt as “keepers of cattle;” and when they left it they took their flocks and herds with them(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_38">Exodus 12:38</span>). Both David and Saul came from “following the herd” to occupy the throne (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_">1 Samuel 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_5">11:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_70">Psalm 78:70</span>). David’s herd-masters were among his chief officers of state. The daughters also of wealthy chiefs were wont to tend the flocks of the family (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_9">Genesis 29:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_16">Exodus 2:16</span>).<br>The “chief of the herdsmen” was in the time of the monarchy an officer of high rank (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_7">1 Samuel 21:7</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_29">1 Chronicles 27:29</span>). The herdsmen lived in tents (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS38_12">Isaiah 38:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR6_3">Jeremiah 6:3</span>); and there were folds for the cattle(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_16">Numbers 32:16</span>), and watch-towers for the herdsmen, that he might therefrom observe any coming danger (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MC4_8">Micah 4:8</span>; Nah. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC3_8">3:8</span>).<br>
