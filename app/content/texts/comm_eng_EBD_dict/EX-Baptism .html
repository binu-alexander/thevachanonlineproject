Till then the New Testament economy did not exist. John’s baptism bound its subjects to repentance, and not to the faith of Christ. It was not administered in the name of the Trinity, and those whom John baptized were rebaptized by Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_24">Acts 18:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_7">19:7</span>).<br>
