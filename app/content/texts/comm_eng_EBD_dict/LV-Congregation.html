Every circumcised Hebrew from twenty years old and upward was a member of the congregation. Strangers resident in the land, if circumcised, were, with certain exceptions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19">Exodus 12:19</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_14">Numbers 9:14</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_1-3">Deuteronomy 23:1-3</span>), admitted to the privileges of citizenship, and spoken of as members of the congregation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_19">Exodus 12:19</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_14">Numbers 9:14</span></span>; 15:15). The congregation were summonded together by the sound of two silver trumpets, and they met at the door of the tabernacle(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_3">Numbers 10:3</span>). These assemblies were convened for the purpose of engaging in solemn religious services (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_27">Exodus 12:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_6">Numbers 25:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JL2_15">Joel 2:15</span>), or of receiving new commandments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_7,8">Exodus 19:7, 8</span>). The elders, who were summonded by the sound of one trumpet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_4">Numbers 10:4</span>), represented on various occasions the whole congregation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_16">Exodus 3:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_21">12:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX17_5">17:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX24_1">24:1</span>).<br>After the conquest of Canaan, the people were assembled only on occasions of the highest national importance (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_">Judges 20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R230_5">2 Chronicles 30:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R234_29">34:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_17">1 Samuel 10:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_1-5">2 Samuel 5:1-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_20">1 Kings 12:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K211_19">2 Kings 11:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_24">21:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_30">23:30</span>). In subsequent times the congregation was represented by the Sanhedrim; and the name synagogue, applied in the Septuagint version exclusively to the congregation, came to be used to denote the places of worship established by the Jews. (See CHURCH.) In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_43">Acts 13:43</span>, where alone it occurs in the New Testament, it is the same word as that rendered “synagogue” (q.v.) in ver. 42, and is so rendered in ver. 43 in R.V.<br>
