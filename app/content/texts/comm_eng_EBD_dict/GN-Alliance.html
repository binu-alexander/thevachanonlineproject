Joshua and the elders of Israel entered into an alliance with the Gibeonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_3-27">Joshua 9:3-27</span>). When the Israelites entered Palestine they were forbidden to enter into alliances with the inhabitants of the country (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV18_3,4">Leviticus 18:3, 4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV20_22,23">20:22, 23</span>).<br>Solomon formed a league with Hiram (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_12">1 Kings 5:12</span>). This “brotherly covenant” is referred to 250 years afterwards (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_9">Amos 1:9</span>). He also appears to have entered into an alliance with Pharaoh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_28,29">1 Kings 10:28, 29</span>).<br>In the subsequent history of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel various alliances were formed between them and also with neighbouring nations at different times.<br>From patriarchal times a covenant of alliance was sealed by the blood of some sacrificial victim. The animal sacrificed was cut in two (except birds), and between these two parts the persons contracting the alliance passed(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_10">Genesis 15:10</span>). There are frequent allusions to this practice (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR34_18">Jeremiah 34:18</span>). Such alliances were called “covenants of salt” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_19">Numbers 18:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R213_5">2 Chronicles 13:5</span>), salt being the symbol of perpetuity. A pillar was set up as a memorial of the alliance between Laban and Jacob (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_52">Genesis 31:52</span>).<br>The Jews throughout their whole history attached great importance to fidelity to their engagements. Divine wrath fell upon the violators of them(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_18">Joshua 9:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_1,2">2 Samuel 21:1, 2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK17_16">Ezekiel 17:16</span>).<br>
