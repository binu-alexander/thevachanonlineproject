Mark (Marcus, <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10">Colossians 4:10</span></span></span>, etc.) was his Roman name, which gradually came to supersede his Jewish name John. He is called John in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_5,13">Acts 13:5, 13</span>, and Mark in 15:39, <span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>, etc.<br>He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_12">Acts 12:12</span>). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas(<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10">Colossians 4:10</span></span></span>). It was in his mother’s house that Peter found “many gathered together praying” when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his“son” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_13">1 Peter 5:13</span></span>). It is probable that the “young man” spoken of in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_51,52">Mark 14:51, 52</span> was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_25">Acts 12:25</span></span>. He went with Paul and Barnabas on their first journey (about A.D. 47) as their “minister,” but from some cause turned back when they reached Perga in Pamphylia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_25">Acts 12:25</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_13">13:13</span>). Three years afterwards a “sharp contention” arose between Paul and Barnabas (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_36-40">15:36-40</span>), because Paul would not take Mark with him. He, however, was evidently at length reconciled to the apostle, for he was with him in his first imprisonment at Rome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_10">Colossians 4:10</span></span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PM1_24">Philemon 1:24</span>). At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_13">1 Peter 5:13</span></span>), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_11">2 Timothy 4:11</span>). He then disappears from view.<br>
