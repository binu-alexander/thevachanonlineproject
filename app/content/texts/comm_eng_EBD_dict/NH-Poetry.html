It has neither metre nor rhyme. Its great peculiarity consists in the mutual correspondence of sentences or clauses, called parallelism, or“thought-rhyme.” Various kinds of this parallelism have been pointed out:(1.) Synonymous or cognate parallelism, where the same idea is repeated in the same words (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS93_3">Psalm 93:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS94_1">94:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR6_2">Proverbs 6:2</span>), or in different words(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS22_,23,28,114">Psalm 22, 23, 28, 114</span>, etc.); or where it is expressed in a positive form in the one clause and in a negative in the other (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS40_12">Psalm 40:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR6_2">Proverbs 6:2</span>6); or where the same idea is expressed in three successive clauses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS40_15,16">Psalm 40:15, 16</span>); or in a double parallelism, the first and second clauses corresponding to the third and fourth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_1">Isaiah 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS61_10,11">61:10, 11</span>).<br>(2.) Antithetic parallelism, where the idea of the second clause is the converse of that of the first (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS20_8">Psalm 20:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS27_6,7">27:6, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_11">34:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS37_9,17,21,22">37:9, 17, 21, 22</span>).<br>This is the common form of gnomic or proverbial poetry. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR10_-15">Proverbs 10-15</span>.)(3.) Synthetic or constructive or compound parallelism, where each clause or sentence contains some accessory idea enforcing the main idea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_7-10">Psalm 19:7-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS85_12">85:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB3_3-9">Job 3:3-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_5-9">Isaiah 1:5-9</span>).<br>(4.) Introverted parallelism, in which of four clauses the first answers to the fourth and the second to the third (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS135_15-18">Psalm 135:15-18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR23_15,16">Proverbs 23:15, 16</span>), or where the second line reverses the order of words in the first(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS86_2">Psalm 86:2</span>).<br>Hebrew poetry sometimes assumes other forms than these. (1.) An alphabetical arrangement is sometimes adopted for the purpose of connecting clauses or sentences. Thus in the following the initial words of the respective verses begin with the letters of the alphabet in regular succession: <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR31_10-31">Proverbs 31:10-31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_,2,3,4">Lamentations 1, 2, 3, 4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS25_,34,37,145">Psalm 25, 34, 37, 145</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_">Psalm 119</span> has a letter of the alphabet in regular order beginning every eighth verse.<br>(2.) The repetition of the same verse or of some emphatic expression at intervals (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS42_,107">Psalm 42, 107</span>, where the refrain is in verses, 8, 15, 21, 31).<br>(Comp. also <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_8-10">Isaiah 9:8-10</span>:4; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_3,6,9,11,13">Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM2_1,4,6">2:1, 4, 6</span>.)(3.) Gradation, in which the thought of one verse is resumed in another(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS121_">Psalm 121</span>).<br>Several odes of great poetical beauty are found in the historical books of the Old Testament, such as the song of Moses (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_">Exodus 15</span>), the song of Deborah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_">Judges 5</span>), of Hannah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_">1 Samuel 2</span>), of Hezekiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS38_9-20">Isaiah 38:9-20</span>), of Habakkuk (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HK3_">Habakkuk 3</span>), and David’s “song of the bow” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_19-27">2 Samuel 1:19-27</span>).<br>
