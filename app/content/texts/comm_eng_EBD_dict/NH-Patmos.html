It is mentioned in Scripture only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_9">Revelation 1:9</span>. It was on this island, to which John was banished by the emperor Domitian (A.D. 95), that he received from God the wondrous revelation recorded in his book. This has naturally invested it with the deepest interest for all time. It is now called Patmo. (See JOHN.)
