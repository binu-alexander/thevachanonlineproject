There were thirty-one kings in Canaan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_9,24">Joshua 12:9, 24</span>), whom Joshua subdued. Adonibezek subdued seventy kings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_7">Judges 1:7</span>). In the New Testament the Roman emperor is spoken of as a king (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P12_13,17">1 Peter 2:13, 17</span>); and Herod Antipas, who was only a tetrarch, is also called a king (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_9">Matthew 14:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_22">Mark 6:22</span>).<br>This title is applied to God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_17">1 Timothy 1:17</span>), and to Christ, the Son of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T16_15,16">1 Timothy 6:15, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_11">Matthew 27:11</span>). The people of God are also called “kings” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN7_22,27">Daniel 7:22, 27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_28">Matthew 19:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_6">Revelation 1:6</span>, etc.).<br>Death is called the “king of terrors” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB18_14">Job 18:14</span>).<br>Jehovah was the sole King of the Jewish nation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S18_7">1 Samuel 8:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS33_22">Isaiah 33:22</span>). But there came a time in the history of that people when a king was demanded, that they might be like other nations (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S18_5">1 Samuel 8:5</span>). The prophet Samuel remonstrated with them, but the people cried out, “Nay, but we will have a king over us.” The misconduct of Samuel’s sons was the immediate cause of this demand.<br>The Hebrew kings did not rule in their own right, nor in name of the people who had chosen them, but partly as servants and partly as representatives of Jehovah, the true King of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_1">1 Samuel 10:1</span>). The limits of the king’s power were prescribed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_25">1 Samuel 10:25</span>). The officers of his court were, (1) the recorder or remembrancer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_16">2 Samuel 8:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_3">1 Kings 4:3</span>); (2) the scribe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_17">2 Samuel 8:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_25">20:25</span>); (3) the officer over the house, the chief steward (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS22_15">Isaiah 22:15</span>); (4) the “king’s friend,” a confidential companion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_5">1 Kings 4:5</span>); (5) the keeper of the wardrobe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K222_14">2 Kings 22:14</span>); (6) captain of the bodyguard (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_23">2 Samuel 20:23</span>); (7) officers over the king’s treasures, etc. (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_25-31">1 Chronicles 27:25-31</span>); (8) commander-in-chief of the army (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_34">1 Chronicles 27:34</span>); (9) the royal counsellor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_32">1 Chronicles 27:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S216_20-23">2 Samuel 16:20-23</span>).<br>(For catalogue of kings of Israel and Judah see chronological table in Appendix.)
