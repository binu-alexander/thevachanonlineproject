The wickedness of its inhabitants brought down upon it fire from heaven, by which it was destroyed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_16-33">18:16-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_1-29">19:1-29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_17">Deuteronomy 23:17</span>). This city and its awful destruction are frequently alluded to in Scripture (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT29_23">Deuteronomy 29:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_32">32:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_9,10">Isaiah 1:9, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS3_9">3:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_19">13:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR23_14">Jeremiah 23:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_46-56">Ezekiel 16:46-56</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_9">Zephaniah 2:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_15">Matthew 10:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM9_29">Romans 9:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_6">2 Peter 2:6</span>, etc.). No trace of it or of the other cities of the plain has been discovered, so complete was their destruction. Just opposite the site of Zoar, on the south-west coast of the Dead Sea, is a range of low hills, forming a mass of mineral salt called Jebel Usdum, “the hill of Sodom.” It has been concluded, from this and from other considerations, that the cities of the plain stood at the southern end of the Dead Sea. Others, however, with much greater probability, contend that they stood at the northern end of the sea. [in 1897].<br>
