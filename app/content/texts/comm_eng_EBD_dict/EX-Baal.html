The name appropriated to the principal male God of the Phoenicians. It is found in several places in the plural BAALIM (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_11">Judges 2:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG10_10">10:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_18">1 Kings 18:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_23">Jeremiah 2:23</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_17">2:17</span>). Baal is identified with Molech (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR19_5">Jeremiah 19:5</span>). It was known to the Israelites as Baal-peor(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_3">Numbers 25:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_3">Deuteronomy 4:3</span>), was worshipped till the time of Samuel (1 Sam 7:4), and was afterwards the religion of the ten tribes in the time of Ahab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_31-33">1 Kings <span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_3">16:3</span>1-33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_19,22">18:19, 22</span>). It prevailed also for a time in the kingdom of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K28_27">2 Kings 8:27</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K211_18">11:18</span>; 16:3; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R228_2">2 Chronicles 28:2</span>), till finally put an end to by the severe discipline of the Captivity(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP1_4-6">Zephaniah 1:4-6</span>). The priests of Baal were in great numbers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K118_19">1 Kings 18:19</span>), and of various classes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_19">2 Kings 10:19</span>). Their mode of offering sacrifices is described in 1 Kings 18:25-29. The sun-God, under the general title of Baal, or “Lord,” was the chief object of worship of the Canaanites.<br>Each locality had its special Baal, and the various local Baals were summed up under the name of Baalim, or “lords.” Each Baal had a wife, who was a colourless reflection of himself.<br>(2.) A Benjamite, son of Jehiel, the progenitor of the Gibeonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_30">1 Chronicles 8:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R19_36">9:36</span>).<br>(3.) The name of a place inhabited by the Simeonites, the same probably as Baal-ath-beer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R14_33">1 Chronicles 4:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_8">Joshua 19:8</span>).<br>
