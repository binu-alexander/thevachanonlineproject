This word means simply “expansion.” It denotes the space or expanse like an arch appearing immediately above us.<br>They who rendered raki’a by firmamentum regarded it as a solid body.<br>The language of Scripture is not scientific but popular, and hence we read of the sun rising and setting, and also here the use of this particular word.<br>It is plain that it was used to denote solidity as well as expansion. It formed a division between the waters above and the waters below (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_7">Genesis 1:7</span>). The raki’a supported the upper reservoir (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS148_4">Psalm 148:4</span>). It was the support also of the heavenly bodies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_14">Genesis 1:14</span>), and is spoken of as having “windows” and “doors” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN7_11">Genesis 7:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_18">Isaiah 24:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ML3_10">Malachi 3:10</span>) through which the rain and snow might descend.<br>
