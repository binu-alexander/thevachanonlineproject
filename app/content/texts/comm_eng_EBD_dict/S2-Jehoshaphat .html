This is the name given in modern times to the valley between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives, and the Kidron flows through it. Here Jehoshaphat overthrew the confederated enemies of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS83_6-8">Psalm 83:6-8</span>); and in this valley also God was to overthrow the Tyrians, Zidonians, etc.<br>(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_4,19">Joel 3:4, 19</span>), with an utter overthrow. This has been fulfilled; but Joel speaks of the final conflict, when God would destroy all Jerusalem’s enemies, of whom Tyre and Zidon, etc., were types. The “valley of Jehoshaphat” may therefore be simply regarded as a general term for the theatre of God’s final judgments on the enemies of Israel.<br>This valley has from ancient times been used by the Jews as a burial-ground. It is all over paved with flat stones as tombstones, bearing on them Hebrew inscriptions.<br>
