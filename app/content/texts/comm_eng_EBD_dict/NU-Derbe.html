Paul passed through Derbe on his route from Cilicia to Iconium, on his second missionary journey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_1">Acts 16:1</span>), and probably also on his third journey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_23">18:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_1">19:1</span>). On his first journey(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC14_20,21">14:20, 21</span>) he came to Derbe from the other side; i.e., from Iconium. It was the native place of Gaius, one of Paulâ€™s companions (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_4">20:4</span>). He did not here suffer persecution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T23_11">2 Timothy 3:11</span>).<br>
