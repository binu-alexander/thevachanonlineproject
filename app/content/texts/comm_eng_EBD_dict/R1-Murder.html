This law in its principle is founded on the fact of manâ€™s having been made in the likeness of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN9_5,6">Genesis 9:5, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN8_44">John 8:44</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="J13_12,15">1 John 3:12, 15</span>). The Mosiac law prohibited any compensation for murder or the reprieve of the murderer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_12,14">Exodus 21:12, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT19_11,13">Deuteronomy 19:11, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_25">2 Samuel 17:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S220_10">20:10</span>). Two witnesses were required in any capital case (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU35_19-30">Numbers 35:19-30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT17_6-12">Deuteronomy 17:6-12</span>). If the murderer could not be discovered, the city nearest the scene of the murder was required to make expiation for the crime committed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT21_1-9">Deuteronomy 21:1-9</span>). These offences also were to be punished with death, (1) striking a parent; (2) cursing a parent; (3) kidnapping (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX21_15-17">Exodus 21:15-17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT27_16">Deuteronomy 27:16</span>).<br>
