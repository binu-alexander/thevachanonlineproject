One of the eleven cities to the west of Hebron, in the highlands of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_49">Joshua 15:49</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_11-15">Judges 1:11-15</span>). It was originally one of the towns of the Anakim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_15">Joshua 15:15</span>), and was also called Kirjath-sepher (q.v.) and Kirjath-sannah (49). Caleb, who had conquered and taken possession of the town and district of Hebron(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS14_6-15">Joshua 14:6-15</span>), offered the hand of his daughter to any one who would successfully lead a party against Debir. Othniel, his younger brother(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_13">Judges 1:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_9">3:9</span>), achieved the conquest, and gained Achsah as his wife.<br>She was not satisfied with the portion her father gave her, and as she was proceeding toward her new home, she “lighted from off her ass” and said to him, “Give me a blessing [i.e., a dowry]: for thou hast given me a south land” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_19">Joshua 15:19</span>, A.V.); or, as in the Revised Version, “Thou hast set me in the land of the south”, i.e., in the Negeb, outside the rich valley of Hebron, in the dry and barren land. “Give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.” Debir has been identified with the modern Edh-Dhaheriyeh, i.e., “the well on the ridge”, to the south of Hebron.<br>(2.) A place near the “valley of Achor” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_7">Joshua 15:7</span>), on the north boundary of Judah, between Jerusalem and Jericho.<br>(3.) The king of Eglon, one of the five Canaanitish kings who were hanged by Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_3,23">Joshua 10:3, 23</span>) after the victory at Gibeon. These kings fled and took refuge in a cave at Makkedah. Here they were kept confined till Joshua returned from the pursuit of their discomfited armies, when he caused them to be brought forth, and “Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees” (26).<br>
