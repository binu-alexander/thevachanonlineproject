The five sons that sprang from this union were put to death by the Gibeonites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_8,9">2 Samuel 21:8, 9</span>. Here it is said that Michal “brought up” [R.V., “bare”] these five sons, either that she treated them as if she had been their own mother, or that for “Michal” we should read “Merab,” as in <span class="bibleref" data-id="S118_19">1 Samuel 18:19</span>).<br>
