Here he tarried for seven days(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_13,14">Acts 28:13, 14</span>). This was the great emporium for the Alexandrian corn ships. Here Paul and his companions began their journey, by the “Appian Way,” to Rome. It is now called Pozzuoli. The remains of a huge amphitheatre, and of the quay at which Paul landed, may still be seen here.<br>
