Here Paul, on his second missionary journey, saw the vision of a “man of Macedonia,” who appeared to him, saying, “Come over, and help us” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_8-11">Acts 16:8-11</span>). He visited this place also on other occasions, and on one of these visits he left his cloak and some books there(<span class="bibleref" data-id="C22_12">2 Corinthians 2:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>). The ruins of Troas extend over many miles, the site being now mostly covered with a forest of oak trees.<br>The modern name of the ruins is Eski Stamboul i.e., Old Constantinople.<br>
