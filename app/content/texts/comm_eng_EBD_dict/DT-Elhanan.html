A warrior of the time of David famed for his exploits. In the Authorized Version (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_19">2 Samuel 21:19</span>) it is recorded that “Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of Goliath.” The Revised Version here rightly omits the words “the brother of.” They were introduced in the Authorized Version to bring this passage into agreement with 1 Chronicles 20:5, where it is said that he “slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath.” Goliath the Gittite was killed by David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_">1 Samuel 17</span>). The exploit of Elhanan took place late in David’s reign.<br>(2.) The son of Dodo, and one of David’s warriors (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_24">2 Samuel 23:24</span>).<br>
