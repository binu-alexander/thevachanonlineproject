Used to denote the people of Moab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_3-14">Numbers 22:3-14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_30">Judges 3:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_2">2 Samuel 8:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_11,13">Jeremiah 48:11, 13</span>).<br>(3.) The land of Moab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_24">Jeremiah 48:24</span>), called also the “country of Moab”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RT1_2,6">Ruth 1:2, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_6">2:6</span>), on the east of Jordan and the Dead Sea, and south of the Arnon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_13,26">Numbers 21:13, 26</span>). In a wider sense it included the whole region that had been occupied by the Amorites. It bears the modern name of Kerak.<br>In the Plains of Moab, opposite Jericho (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU22_1">Numbers 22:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_63">26:63</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_32">Joshua 13:32</span>), the children of Israel had their last encampment before they entered the land of Canaan. It was at that time in the possession of the Amorites(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_22">Numbers 21:22</span>). “Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,” and “died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT34_5,6">Deuteronomy 34:5, 6</span>). “Surely if we had nothing else to interest us in the land of Moab, the fact that it was from the top of Pisgah, its noblest height, this mightiest of the prophets looked out with eye undimmed upon the Promised Land; that it was here on Nebo, its loftiest mountain, that he died his solitary death; that it was here, in the valley over against Beth-peor, he found his mysterious sepulchre, we have enough to enshrine the memory in our hearts.”
