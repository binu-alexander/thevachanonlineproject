At the summons of Deborah he made war against Jabin. She accompanied him into the battle, and gave the signal for the little army to make the attack; in which the host of Jabin was completely routed. The battle was fought (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_16">Judges 4:16</span>) in the plain of Jezreel (q.v.). This deliverance of Israel is commemorated in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG5_">Judges 5</span>. Barak’s faith is commended (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_32">Hebrews 11:32</span>). “The character of Barak, though pious, does not seem to have been heroic. Like Gideon, and in a sense Samson, he is an illustration of the words in <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_34">Hebrews 11:34</span>,‘Out of weakness were made strong.’” (See DEBORAH.)
