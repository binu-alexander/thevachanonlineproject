It marks the north boundary of Palestine (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_8,4">Deuteronomy 3:8, 4</span>:48; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_3,17">Joshua 11:3, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_11">13:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_1">12:1</span>), and is seen from a great distance. It is about 40 miles north of the Sea of Galilee. It is called “the Hermonites” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS42_6">Psalm 42:6</span>) because it has more than one summit. The Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_9">Deuteronomy 3:9</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_8">4:8</span>). It is also called Baal-hermon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_3">Judges 3:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_23">1 Chronicles 5:23</span>) and Sion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_48">Deuteronomy 4:48</span>). There is every probability that one of its three summits was the scene of the transfiguration (q.v.). The “dew of Hermon” is referred to(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS89_12">Psalm 89: 12</span>). Its modern name is Jebel-esh-Sheikh, “the chief mountain.” It is one of the most conspicuous mountains in Palestine or Syria. “In whatever part of Palestine the Israelite turned his eye northward, Hermon was there, terminating the view. From the plain along the coast, from the Jordan valley, from the heights of Moab and Gilead, from the plateau of Bashan, the pale, blue, snow-capped cone forms the one feature in the northern horizon.” Our Lord and his disciples climbed this “high mountain apart” one day, and remained on its summit all night, “weary after their long and toilsome ascent.” During the night “he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun.” The next day they descended to Caesarea Philippi.<br>
