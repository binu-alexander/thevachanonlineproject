Mention is made of such tombs in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_32">Judges 8:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S22_32">2 Samuel 2:32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_28">2 Kings 9:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_30">23:30</span>. They were sometimes made in gardens(<span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_26">2 Kings 21:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_16">23:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_60">Matthew 27:60</span>). They are found in great numbers in and around Jerusalem and all over the land. They were sometimes whitewashed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_27,29">Matthew 23:27, 29</span>). The body of Jesus was laid in Joseph’s new rock-hewn tomb, in a garden near to Calvary. All evidence is in favour of the opinion that this tomb was somewhere near the Damascus gate, and outside the city, and cannot be identified with the so-called “holy sepulchre.” The mouth of such rocky tombs was usually closed by a large stone (Hebrews golal), which could only be removed by the united efforts of several men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_2">Matthew 28:2</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN11_39">John 11:39</span>).
