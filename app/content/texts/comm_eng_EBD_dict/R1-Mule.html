It is not probable that the Hebrews bred mules, as this was strictly forbidden in the law (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_19">Leviticus 19:19</span>), although their use was not forbidden. We find them in common use even by kings and nobles(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_9">2 Samuel 18:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_33">1 Kings 1:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_17">2 Kings 5:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS32_9">Psalm 32:9</span>). They are not mentioned, however, till the time of David, for the word rendered “mules”(R.V. correctly, “hot springs”) in <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN36_24">Genesis 36:24</span> (yemim) properly denotes the warm springs of Callirhoe, on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. In David’s reign they became very common (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S213_29">2 Samuel 13:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K110_25">1 Kings 10:25</span>).<br>Mules are not mentioned in the New Testament. Perhaps they had by that time ceased to be used in Palestine.<br>
