The first altar after the Flood was built on a mountain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN8_20">Genesis 8:20</span>). Abraham also built an altar on a mountain (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_7,8">12:7, 8</span>). It was on a mountain in Gilead that Laban and Jacob offered sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_54">31:54</span>). After the Israelites entered the Promised Land they were strictly enjoined to overthrow the high places of the Canaanites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_13">Exodus 34:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_5">Deuteronomy 7:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_2,3">12:2, 3</span>), and they were forbidden to worship the Lord on high places (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_11-14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_">Deuteronomy 12</span>:11-14</span>), and were enjoined to use but one altar for sacrifices (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV17_3,4">Leviticus 17:3, 4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_">Deuteronomy 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_21">16:21</span>). The injunction against high places was, however, very imperfectly obeyed, and we find again and again mention made of them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K214_4">2 Kings 14:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_4,35">15:4, 35</span>:<span class="bibleref" data-id="R215_17">2 Chronicles 15:17</span>, etc.).<br>
