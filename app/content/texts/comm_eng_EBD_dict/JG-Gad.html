Jacob’s seventh son, by Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid, and the brother of Asher (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_11-13">Genesis 30:11-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_16,18">46:16, 18</span>). In the Authorized Version of 30:11 the words, “A troop cometh: and she called,” etc., should rather be rendered, “In fortune [R.V., ‘Fortunate’]: and she called,” etc., or“Fortune cometh,” etc.<br>The tribe of Gad during the march through the wilderness had their place with Simeon and Reuben on the south side of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_14">Numbers 2:14</span>). The tribes of Reuben and Gad continued all through their history to follow the pastoral pursuits of the patriarchs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_1-5">Numbers 32:1-5</span>).<br>The portion allotted to the tribe of Gad was on the east of Jordan, and comprehended the half of Gilead, a region of great beauty and fertility(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_12">Deuteronomy 3:12</span>), bounded on the east by the Arabian desert, on the west by the Jordan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_27">Joshua 13:27</span>), and on the north by the river Jabbok.<br>It thus included the whole of the Jordan valley as far north as to the Sea of Galilee, where it narrowed almost to a point.<br>This tribe was fierce and warlike; they were “strong men of might, men of war for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, their faces the faces of lions, and like roes upon the mountains for swiftness” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_8">1 Chronicles 12:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_19-22">5:19-22</span>). Barzillai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_27">2 Samuel 17:27</span>) and Elijah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K117_1">1 Kings 17:1</span>) were of this tribe. It was carried into captivity at the same time as the other tribes of the northern kingdom by Tiglath-pileser (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_26">1 Chronicles 5:26</span>), and in the time of Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R149_1">49:1</span>) their cities were inhabited by the Ammonites.<br>(2.) A prophet who joined David in the “hold,” and at whose advice he quitted it for the forest of Hareth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29">1 Chronicles 29:29</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_25">2 Chronicles 29:25</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_5">1 Samuel 22:5</span>). Many years after we find mention made of him in connection with the punishment inflicted for numbering the people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_11-19">2 Samuel 24:11-19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_9-19"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_9">1 Chronicles 21:9</span>-19</span>). He wrote a book called the “Acts of David” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29">1 Chronicles 29:29</span></span>), and assisted in the arrangements for the musical services of the “house of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_25"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_25">2 Chronicles 29:25</span></span>). He bore the title of “the king’s seer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_11,13">2 Samuel 24:11, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_9">1 Chronicles 21:9</span>).<br>
