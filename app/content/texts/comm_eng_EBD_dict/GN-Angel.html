</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Angel" ><div class="is"><b>ANGEL</b></div><br>"ANGEL "a word signifying, both in the Hebrew and Greek, a “messenger,” and hence employed to denote any agent God sends forth to execute his purposes. It is used of an ordinary messenger (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_14">Job 1:14</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_3">1 Samuel 11:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK7_24">Luke 7:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_52">9:52</span>), of prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS42_19">Isaiah 42:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG1_13">Haggai 1:13</span>), of priests(<span class="bibleref" data-id="ML2_7">Malachi 2:7</span>), and ministers of the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_20">Revelation 1:20</span>).<br>It is also applied to such impersonal agents as the pestilence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_16,17"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_16">2 Samuel 24:16</span>, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_35"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_35">2 Kings 19:35</span></span>), the wind (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_4">Psalm 104:4</span></span>).<br>But its distinctive application is to certain heavenly intelligences whom God employs in carrying on his government of the world. The name does not denote their nature but their office as messengers. The appearances to Abraham at Mamre (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_2,22"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_">Genesis 18</span>:2</span>, 22</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_1">19:1</span>), to Jacob at Peniel(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_24,30">Genesis 32:24, 30</span>), to Joshua at Gilgal (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS5_13,15">Joshua 5:13, 15</span>), of the Angel of the Lord, were doubtless manifestations of the Divine presence,“foreshadowings of the incarnation,” revelations before the “fulness of the time” of the Son of God.<br>(1.) The existence and orders of angelic beings can only be discovered from the Scriptures. Although the Bible does not treat of this subject specially, yet there are numerous incidental details that furnish us with ample information. Their personal existence is plainly implied in such passages as <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN16_7,10,11">Genesis 16:7, 10, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_1-21">Judges 13:1-21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_2-5">Matthew 28:2-5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_4">Hebrews 1:4</span>, etc.<br>These superior beings are very numerous. “Thousand thousands,” etc.<br>(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN7_10">Daniel 7:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_53">Matthew 26:53</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_13">Luke 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB12_22,23">Hebrews 12:22, 23</span>). They are also spoken of as of different ranks in dignity and power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_9,11">Zechariah 1:9, 11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN10_13">Daniel 10:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN12_1">12:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H14_16">1 Thessalonians 4:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JD1_9">Jude 1:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP1_21">Ephesians 1:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_16">Colossians 1:16</span>).<br>(2.) As to their nature, they are spirits (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_14">Hebrews 1:14</span></span>), like the soul of man, but not incorporeal. Such expressions as “like the angels” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36">Luke 20:36</span></span></span>), and the fact that whenever angels appeared to man it was always in a human form (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_2"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_">Genesis 18</span>:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN19_1,10">19:1, 10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK24_4">Luke 24:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_10">Acts 1:10</span>), and the titles that are applied to them (“sons of God,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB1_6">Job 1:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_7">38:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_25">Daniel 3:25</span>; comp.<br>28) and to men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK3_38">Luke 3:38</span>), seem all to indicate some resemblance between them and the human race. Imperfection is ascribed to them as creatures(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB4_18">Job 4:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_36">Matthew 24:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_12">1 Peter 1:12</span>). As finite creatures they may fall under temptation; and accordingly we read of “fallen angels.” Of the cause and manner of their “fall” we are wholly ignorant. We know only that“they left their first estate” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_41">Matthew 25:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV12_7,9">Revelation <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_7">12:7</span>,9</span>), and that they are “reserved unto judgement” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_4">2 Peter 2:4</span>). When the manna is called“angels’ food,” this is merely to denote its excellence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_25">Psalm 78:25</span>).<br>Angels never die (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36">Luke 20:36</span></span></span>). They are possessed of superhuman intelligence and power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK13_32">Mark <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_3">13:3</span>2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H21_7">2 Thessalonians 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS103_20">Psalm 103:20</span>).<br>They are called “holy” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_26">Luke 9:26</span>), “elect” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T15_21">1 Timothy 5:21</span>). The redeemed in glory are “like unto the angels” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LK20_36">Luke 20:36</span></span></span>). They are not to be worshipped (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL2_18">Colossians 2:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV19_10">Revelation 19:10</span>).<br>(3.) Their functions are manifold. (a) In the widest sense they are agents of God’s providence (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_23">Exodus 12:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_4"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS104_4">Psalm 104:4</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_28">Hebrews 11:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_10">1 Corinthians 10:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_16">2 Samuel 24:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_16">1 Chronicles 21:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_35"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K219_35">2 Kings 19:35</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_23">Acts 12:23</span>). (b) They are specially God’s agents in carrying on his great work of redemption. There is no notice of angelic appearances to man till after the call of Abraham. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_">Genesis 18</span>; 19; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN24_7,40">24:7, 40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_12">28:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_1">32:1</span>). They appear to rebuke idolatry (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_1-4">Judges 2:1-4</span>), to call Gideon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG6_11,12">Judges 6:11, 12</span>), and to consecrate Samson (13:3). In the days of the prophets, from Samuel downward, the angels appear only in their behalf (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_5">1 Kings 19:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_17">2 Kings 6:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC1_-6">Zechariah 1-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN4_13,23">Daniel 4:13, 23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN10_10,13,20,21">10:10, 13, 20, 21</span>).<br>The Incarnation introduces a new era in the ministrations of angels. They come with their Lord to earth to do him service while here. They predict his advent (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT1_20">Matthew 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_26-38">Luke 1:26-38</span>), minister to him after his temptation and agony (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_11">Matthew 4:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_43">Luke 22:43</span>), and declare his resurrection and ascension (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_2-8">Matthew 28:2-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_12,13">John 20:12, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_10">Acts 1:10</span>, 11). They are now ministering spirits to the people of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_14"><span class="bibleref" data-id="HB1_14">Hebrews 1:14</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_7">Psalm 34:7</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS91_11">91:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_10">Matthew 18:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC5_19">Acts 5:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_26">8:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC10_3">10:3</span>; 12:7; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC27_23">27:23</span>).<br>They rejoice over a penitent sinner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_10">Luke 15:10</span>). They bear the souls of the redeemed to paradise (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_22">Luke 16:22</span>); and they will be the ministers of judgement hereafter on the great day (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_39,41,49">Matthew 13:39, 41, 49</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_27">16:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_31">24:31</span>). The passages (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_7">Psalm 34:7</span></span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_10">Matthew 18:10</span></span>) usually referred to in support of the idea that every individual has a particular guardian angel have no such meaning. They merely indicate that God employs the ministry of angels to deliver his people from affliction and danger, and that the angels do not think it below their dignity to minister even to children and to the least among Christ’s disciples.<br>The “angel of his presence” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS63_9">Isaiah 63:9</span>. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_20,21">Exodus 23:20, 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX32_34">32:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX33_2">33:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU20_16">Numbers 20:16</span>) is probably rightly interpreted of the Messiah as the guide of his people. Others have supposed the expression to refer to Gabriel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK1_19">Luke 1:19</span>).<br>
