To Endor, Saul resorted to consult one reputed to be a witch on the eve of his last engagement with the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_7">1 Samuel 28:7</span>). It is identified with the modern village of Endur, “a dirty hamlet of some twenty houses, or rather huts, most of them falling to ruin,” on the northern slope of Little Hermon, about 7 miles from Jezreel.<br>
