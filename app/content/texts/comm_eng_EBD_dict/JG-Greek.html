The former is (1) a Greek by race (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_1-3">Acts 16:1-3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_17">18:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RM1_14">Romans 1:14</span>), or (2) a Gentile as opposed to a Jew (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM2_9,10">Romans 2:9, 10</span>). The latter, meaning properly “one who speaks Greek,” is a foreign Jew opposed to a home Jew who dwelt in Palestine.<br>The word “Grecians” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC11_20">Acts 11:20</span> should be “Greeks,” denoting the heathen Greeks of that city, as rendered in the Revised Version according to the reading of the best manuscripts (“Hellenes”).<br>
