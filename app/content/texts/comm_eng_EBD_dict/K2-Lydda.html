It lay about 9 miles east of Joppa, on the road from the sea-port to Jerusalem. In the Old Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_12">1 Chronicles 8:12</span>) it is called Lod. It was burned by the Romans, but was afterwards rebuilt, and was known by the name of Diospolis. Its modern name is Ludd. The so-called patron saint of England, St. George, is said to have been born here.<br>
