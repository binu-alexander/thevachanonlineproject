Here Solomon built ships, “Tarshish ships,” like those trading from Tyre to Tarshish and the west, which traded with Ophir (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_26">1 Kings 9:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R28_17">2 Chronicles 8:17</span>); and here also Jehoshaphat’s fleet was shipwrecked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_48">1 Kings 22:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R220_36">2 Chronicles 20:36</span>). It became a populous town, many of the Jews settling in it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_6">2 Kings 16:6</span>, “Elath”). It is supposed that anciently the north end of the gulf flowed further into the country than now, as far as ‘Ain el-Ghudyan, which is 10 miles up the dry bed of the Arabah, and that Ezion-geber may have been there.<br>
