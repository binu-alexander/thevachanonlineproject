Wine-presses are found in almost every part of Palestine. They are “the only sure relics we have of the old days of Israel before the Captivity. Between Hebron and Beersheba they are found on all the hill slopes; they abound in southern Judea; they are no less common in the many valleys of Carmel; and they are numerous in Galilee.” The “treading of the wine-press” is emblematic of divine judgment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS63_2">Isaiah 63:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_15"><span class="bibleref" data-id="LM1_15">Lamentations 1:15</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV14_19,20">Revelation 14:19, 20</span>).<br>
