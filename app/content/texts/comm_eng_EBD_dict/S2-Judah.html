The name originated in Leah’s words of praise to the Lord on account of his birth: “Now will I praise [Hebrews odeh] Jehovah, and she called his name Yehudah”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN29_35">Genesis 29:35</span>).<br>It was Judah that interposed in behalf of Joseph, so that his life was spared (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_26,27">Genesis 37:26, 27</span>). He took a lead in the affairs of the family, and“prevailed above his brethren” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN43_3-10">Genesis 43:3-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN44_14,16-34">44:14, 16-34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_28">46:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R15_2">1 Chronicles 5:2</span>).<br>Soon after the sale of Joseph to the Ishmaelites, Judah went to reside at Adullam, where he married a woman of Canaan. (See ONAN; TAMAR.) After the death of his wife Shuah, he returned to his father’s house, and there exercised much influence over the patriarch, taking a principal part in the events which led to the whole family at length going down into Egypt.<br>We hear nothing more of him till he received his father’s blessing (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN49_8-12">Genesis 49:8-12</span>).<br>
