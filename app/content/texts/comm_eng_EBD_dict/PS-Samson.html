The narrative of his life is given in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_-16">Judges 13-16</span>. He was a “Nazarite unto God” from his birth, the first Nazarite mentioned in Scripture (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_3-5">Judges 13:3-5</span>; comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_1-21">Numbers 6:1-21</span>). The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_1-5">Judges 14:1-5</span>). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_11-16">Exodus 34:11-16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT7_1-4">Deuteronomy 7:1-4</span>).<br>It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given “to his companion” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG14_20">Judges 14:20</span>). For this Samson took revenge by burning the “standing corn of the Philistines”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG15_1-8">15:1-8</span>), who, in their turn, in revenge “burnt her and her father with fire.” Her death he terribly avenged (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG15_7-19">15:7-19</span>). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli’s life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_1-3">16:1-3</span>), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_4-20">16:4-20</span>), and then of his melancholy death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21-31">16:21-31</span>). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. “So the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life.”“Straining all his nerves, he bowed: As with the force of winds and waters pent, When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars With horrible convulsion to and fro He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder Upon the heads of all who sat beneath, Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests, Their choice nobility and flower.” Milton’s Samson Agonistes.<br>
