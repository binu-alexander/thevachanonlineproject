Thus the letters sh, sh, ch become b, b, l, i.e., Babel. This is supposed to be confirmed by a reference to <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_41">Jeremiah 51:41</span>, where Sheshach and Babylon are in parallel clauses. There seems to be no reason to doubt that Babylon is here intended by this name. (See Streaneâ€™s Jeremiah, l.c.)
