Hebrews ‘asherah, properly a wooden image, or a pillar representing Ashtoreth, a sensual Canaanitish goddess, probably usually set up in a grove (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K221_7">2 Kings 21:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_4">23:4</span>). In the Revised Version the word“Asherah” (q.v.) is introduced as a proper noun, the name of the wooden symbol of a goddess, with the plurals Asherim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_13">Exodus 34:13</span>) and Asheroth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_13">Judges 3:13</span>).<br>The LXX. have rendered asherah in 2 Chronicles 15:16 by “Astarte.” The Vulgate has done this also in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_7">Judges 3:7</span>.<br>(2.) Hebrews ‘eshel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_33">Genesis 21:33</span>). In 1 Samuel 22:6 and 31:13 the Authorized Version renders this word by “tree.” In all these passages the Revised Version renders by “tamarisk tree.” It has been identified with the Tamariscus orientalis, five species of which are found in Palestine.<br>(3.) The Hebrews word ‘elon, uniformly rendered in the Authorized Version by “plain,” properly signifies a grove or plantation. In the Revised Version it is rendered, pl., “oaks” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_18">Genesis 13:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_13">14:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN18_1">18:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_6">12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT11_30">Deuteronomy 11:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_33">Joshua 19:33</span>). In the earliest times groves are mentioned in connection with religious worship. The heathen consecrated groves to particular gods, and for this reason they were forbidden to the Jews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR17_3">Jeremiah 17:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK20_28">Ezekiel 20:28</span>).<br>
