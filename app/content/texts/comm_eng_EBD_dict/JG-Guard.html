Hebrews tabbah (properly a “cook,” and in a secondary sense “executioner,” because this office fell to the lot of the cook in Eastern countries), the bodyguard of the kings of Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_36">Genesis 3<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_3">7:3</span>6</span>) and Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_8">2 Kings 25:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_1">Jeremiah 40:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_14">Daniel 2:14</span>).<br>(2.) Hebrews rats, properly a “courier,” one whose office was to run before the king’s chariot (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_1">2 Samuel 15:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_5">1 Kings 1:5</span>). The couriers were also military guards (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_17">1 Samuel 22:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_25">2 Kings 10:25</span>). They were probably the same who under David were called Pelethites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_27">1 Kings 14:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_1"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S215_1">2 Samuel 15:1</span></span>).<br>(3.) Hebrews mishmereth, one who watches (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH4_22">Nehemiah 4:22</span>), or a watch-station (7:3; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_9">12:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB7_12">Job 7:12</span>).<br>In the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_27">Mark 6:27</span>) the Authorized Version renders the Greek spekulator by “executioner,” earlier English versions by “hangman,” the Revised Version by “soldier of his guard.” The word properly means a“pikeman” or “halberdier,” of whom the bodyguard of kings and princes was composed. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_65,66">Matthew 27:65, 66</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_11">28:11</span>, the Authorized Version renders the Greek kustodia by “watch,” and the Revised Version by“guard,” the Roman guard, which consisted of four soldiers, who were relieved every three hours (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_4">Acts 12:4</span>). The “captain of the guard” mentioned <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_16">Acts 28:16</span> was the commander of the Praetorian troops, whose duty it was to receive and take charge of all prisoners from the provinces.<br>
