While living in the midst of great prosperity, he was suddenly overwhelmed by a series of sore trials that fell upon him. Amid all his sufferings he maintained his integrity. Once more God visited him with the rich tokens of his goodness and even greater prosperity than he had enjoyed before. He survived the period of trial for one hundred and forty years, and died in a good old age, an example to succeeding generations of integrity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK14_14,20">Ezekiel 14:14, 20</span>) and of submissive patience under the sorest calamities (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM5_11">James 5:11</span>). His history, so far as it is known, is recorded in his book.<br>
