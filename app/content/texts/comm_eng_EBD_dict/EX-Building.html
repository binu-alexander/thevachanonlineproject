They probably adopted the kind of architecture for their dwellings which they found already existing when they entered Canaan(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT6_10">Deuteronomy 6:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_19">Numbers 13:19</span>). Phoenician artists (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_11">2 Samuel 5:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_6,18">1 Kings 5:6, 18</span>) assisted at the erection of the royal palace and the temple at Jerusalem. Foreigners also assisted at the restoration of the temple after the Exile (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_7">Ezra 3:7</span>).<br>In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN11_3,9">Genesis 11:3, 9</span>, we have the first recorded instance of the erection of buildings. The cities of the plain of Shinar were founded by the descendants of Shem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_11,12,22">10:11, 12, 22</span>).<br>The Israelites were by occupation shepherds and dwellers in tents(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN47_3">Genesis 47:3</span>); but from the time of their entering Canaan they became dwellers in towns, and in houses built of the native limestone of Palestine.<br>Much building was carried on in Solomon’s time. Besides the buildings he completed at Jerusalem, he also built Baalath and Tadmor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K19_15,24">1 Kings 9:15, 24</span>). Many of the kings of Israel and Judah were engaged in erecting various buildings.<br>Herod and his sons and successors restored the temple, and built fortifications and other structures of great magnificence in Jerusalem (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_5">Luke 21:5</span>).<br>The instruments used in building are mentioned as the plumb-line (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM7_7">Amos 7:7</span>), the measuring-reed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK40_3">Ezekiel 40:3</span>), and the saw (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_9">1 Kings 7:9</span>).<br>Believers are “God’s building” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_9">1 Corinthians 3:9</span>); and heaven is called “a building of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C25_1">2 Corinthians 5:1</span>). Christ is the only foundation of his church (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C13_10-12">1 Corinthians 3:10-12</span>), of which he also is the builder (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_18">Matthew 16:18</span>).<br>
