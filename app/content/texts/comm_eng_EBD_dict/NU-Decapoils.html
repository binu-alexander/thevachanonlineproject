It included a portion of Bashan and Gilead, and is mentioned three times in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_25">Matthew 4:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_20">Mark 5:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_31">7:31</span>). These cities were Scythopolis, i.e., “city of the Scythians”,(ancient Bethshean, the only one of the ten cities on the west of Jordan), Hippos, Gadara, Pella (to which the Christians fled just before the destruction of Jerusalem), Philadelphia (ancient Rabbath-ammon), Gerasa, Dion, Canatha, Raphana, and Damascus. When the Romans conquered Syria (B.C. 65) they rebuilt, and endowed with certain privileges, these“ten cities,” and the province connected with them they called“Decapolis.”
