The espousal was a ceremony of betrothing, a formal agreement between the parties then coming under obligation for the purpose of marriage. Espousals are in the East frequently contracted years before the marriage is celebrated. It is referred to as figuratively illustrating the relations between God and his people (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR2_2">Jeremiah 2:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT1_18">Matthew 1:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C211_2">2 Corinthians 11:2</span>).
