He appears to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C28_6">2 Corinthians 8:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C212_18">12:18</span>). He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C27_6-15">7:6-15</span>). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paulâ€™s first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose (<span class="bibleref" data-id="TT1_5">Titus 1:5</span>). The last notice of him is in 2 Timothy 4:10, where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment. From Rome he was sent into Dalmatia, no doubt on some important missionary errand. We have no record of his death. He is not mentioned in the Acts.<br>
