In the time of the apostles it was a Roman province. Strangers from this province were at Jerusalem at Pentecost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC2_9">Acts 2:9</span>), and to“strangers scattered throughout Pontus,” among others, Peter addresses his first epistle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_1">1 Peter 1:1</span>). It was evidently the resort of many Jews of the Dispersion. Aquila was a native of Pontus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_2">Acts 18:2</span>).<br>
