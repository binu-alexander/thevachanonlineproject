Of the tribe founded by him nothing is recorded beyond its holding a place in the list of the tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN35_26">35:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_17">46:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX1_4">Exodus 1:4</span>, etc.) It increased in numbers twenty-nine percent, during the thirty-eight years’ wanderings. The place of this tribe during the march through the desert was between Dan and Naphtali (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU2_27">Numbers 2:27</span>). The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_24-31">Joshua 19:24-31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_31,32">Judges 1:31, 32</span>. Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west of the Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation. Anna the prophetess was of this tribe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK2_36">Luke 2:36</span>).<br>
