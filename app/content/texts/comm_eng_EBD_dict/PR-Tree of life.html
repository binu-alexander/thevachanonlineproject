Some writers have advanced the opinion that this tree had some secret virtue, which was fitted to preserve life. Probably the lesson conveyed was that life was to be sought by man, not in himself or in his own power, but from without, from Him who is emphatically the Life(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_4">John 1:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN14_6">14:6</span>). Wisdom is compared to the tree of life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR3_18">Proverbs 3:18</span>).<br>The “tree of life” spoken of in the Book of Revelation (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_7">Revelation 2:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV22_2,14">22:2, 14</span>) is an emblem of the joys of the celestial paradise.<br>
