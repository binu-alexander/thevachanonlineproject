It was about 12 miles above Laodicea, and near the great road from Ephesus to the Euphrates, and was consequently of some mercantile importance. It does not appear that Paul had visited this city when he wrote his letter to the church there (<span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_2">Colossians 1:2</span>). He expresses in his letter to Philemon (ver. <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_22">1:22</span>) his hope to visit it on being delivered from his imprisonment. From <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL1_7">Colossians 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="CL4_12">4:12</span> it has been concluded that Epaphras was the founder of the Colossian church. This town afterwards fell into decay, and the modern town of Chonas or Chonum occupies a site near its ruins.<br>
