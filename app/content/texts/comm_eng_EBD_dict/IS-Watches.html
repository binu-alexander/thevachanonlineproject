They are so called because watchmen relieved each other at each of these periods. There are frequent references in Scripture to the duties of watchmen who were appointed to give notice of the approach of an enemy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S218_24-27">2 Samuel 18:24-27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_17-20">2 Kings 9:17-20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS21_5-9">Isaiah 21:5-9</span>). They were sometimes placed for this purpose on watch-towers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_9">2 Kings 17:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_8">18:8</span>).<br>Ministers or teachers are also spoken of under this title (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR6_17">Jeremiah 6:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK33_2-9">Ezekiel 33:2-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_17">Hebrews 13:17</span>).<br>The watches of the night were originally three in number, (1) “the beginning of the watches” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LM2_19">Lamentations 2:19</span>); (2) “the middle watch”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_19">Judges 7:19</span>); and (3) “the morning watch” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX14_24">Exodus 14:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S111_11">1 Samuel 11:11</span>), which extended from two o’clock to sunrise. But in the New Testament we read of four watches, a division probably introduced by the Romans (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT14_25">Matthew 14:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_48">Mark 6:48</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_38">Luke 12:38</span>).
