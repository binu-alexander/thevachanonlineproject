The Bible so called because the writers of its several books were God’s organs in communicating his will to men. It is his “word,” because he speaks to us in its sacred pages.<br>Whatever the inspired writers here declare to be true and binding upon us, God declares to be true and binding. This word is infallible, because written under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and therefore free from all error of fact or doctrine or precept. (See INSPIRATION; BIBLE.) All saving knowledge is obtained from the word of God. In the case of adults it is an indispensable means of salvation, and is efficacious thereunto by the gracious influence of the Holy Spirit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN17_17">John 17:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T23_15,16">2 Timothy 3:15, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_23">1 Peter 1:23</span>).<br>
