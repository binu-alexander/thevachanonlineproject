It is thus rendered in the New Testament, and is more frequently mentioned than any other coin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT18_28">Matthew 18:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_2,9,13">20:2, 9, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_37">Mark 6:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_5">14:5</span>, etc.). It was the daily pay of a Roman soldier in the time of Christ. In the reign of Edward III. an English penny was a labourer’s day’s wages. This was the “tribute money” with reference to which our Lord said, “Whose image and superscription is this?” When they answered, “Caesar’s,” he replied, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_19">Matthew 22:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK12_15">Mark 12:15</span>).<br>
