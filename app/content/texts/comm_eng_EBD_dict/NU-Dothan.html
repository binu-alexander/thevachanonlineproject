Here, at the suggestion of Judah, they sold him to the Ishmaelite merchants (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_17">Genesis 37:17</span>). It is mentioned on monuments in B.C. 1600.<br>It was the residence of Elisha (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_13">2 Kings 6:13</span>), and the scene of a remarkable vision of chariots and horses of fire surrounding the mountain on which the city stood. It is identified with the modern Tell-Dothan, on the south side of the plain of Jezreel, about 12 miles north of Samaria, among the hills of Gilboa. The “two wells” are still in existence, one of which bears the name of the “pit of Joseph” (Jubb Yusuf).<br>
