Whatever grew of itself during that year was not for the owner of the land, but for the poor and the stranger and the beasts of the field. All debts, except those of foreigners, were to be remitted (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT15_1-11">Deuteronomy 15:1-11</span>). There is little notice of the observance of this year in Biblical history. It appears to have been much neglected (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R236_20,21">2 Chronicles 36:20, 21</span>).<br>
