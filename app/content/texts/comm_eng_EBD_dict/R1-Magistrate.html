The Hebrew shophetim, or judges, were magistrates having authority in the land(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_16,17">Deuteronomy 1:16, 17</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG18_7">Judges 18:7</span> the word “magistrate” (A.V.) is rendered in the Revised Version “possessing authority”, i.e., having power to do them harm by invasion. In the time of Ezra (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG9_2">9:2</span>) and Nehemiah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG2_16">2:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_14">4:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG13_11">13:11</span>) the Jewish magistrates were called seganim, properly meaning “nobles.” In the New Testament the Greek word archon, rendered“magistrate” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_58">Luke 12:58</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="TT3_1">Titus 3:1</span>), means one first in power, and hence a prince, as in <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_25,1">Matthew 20:25, 1</span> Corinthians 2:6, 8. This term is used of the Messiah, “Prince of the kings of the earth” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_5">Revelation 1:5</span>). In <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_20,22,35,36,38">Acts 16:20, 22, 35, 36, 38</span>, the Greek term strategos, rendered “magistrate,” properly signifies the leader of an army, a general, one having military authority. The strategoi were the duumviri, the two praetors appointed to preside over the administration of justice in the colonies of the Romans.<br>They were attended by the sergeants (properly lictors or “rod bearers”).<br>
