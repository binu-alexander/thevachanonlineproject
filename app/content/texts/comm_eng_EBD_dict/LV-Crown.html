Denotes the plate of gold in the front of the high priest’s mitre (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_6">Exodus 29:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_30">39:30</span>). The same Hebrew word so rendered (ne’zer) denotes the diadem worn by Saul in battle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S21_10">2 Samuel 1:10</span>), and also that which was used at the coronation of Joash (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K211_12">2 Kings 11:12</span>).<br>(2.) The more general name in Hebrew for a crown is ’atarah, meaning a“circlet.” This is used of crowns and head ornaments of divers kinds, including royal crowns. Such was the crown taken from the king of Ammon by David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_30">2 Samuel 12:30</span>). The crown worn by the Assyrian kings was a high mitre, sometimes adorned with flowers. There are sculptures also representing the crowns worn by the early Egyptian and Persian kings. Sometimes a diadem surrounded the royal head-dress of two or three fillets. This probably signified that the wearer had dominion over two or three countries. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV12_3">Revelation 12:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV13_1">13:1</span>, we read of “many crowns,” a token of extended dominion.<br>(3.) The ancient Persian crown (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ET1_11">Esther 1:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET2_17">2:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET6_8">6:8</span>) was called kether; i.e., “a chaplet,” a high cap or tiara. Crowns were worn sometimes to represent honour and power (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK23_42">Ezekiel 23:42</span>). They were worn at marriages(Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK3_11">3:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS61_10">Isaiah 61:10</span>, “ornaments;” R.V., “a garland”), and at feasts and public festivals.<br>The crown was among the Romans and Greeks a symbol of victory and reward. The crown or wreath worn by the victors in the Olympic games was made of leaves of the wild olive; in the Pythian games, of laurel; in the Nemean games, of parsley; and in the Isthmian games, of the pine. The Romans bestowed the “civic crown” on him who saved the life of a citizen.<br>It was made of the leaves of the oak. In opposition to all these fading crowns the apostles speak of the incorruptible crown, the crown of life(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM1_12">James 1:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_10">Revelation 2:10</span>) “that fadeth not away” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P15_4">1 Peter 5:4</span>, Gr.<br>amarantinos; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_4">1:4</span>). Probably the word “amaranth” was applied to flowers we call “everlasting,” the “immortal amaranth.”
