In the Book of Job, which is the oldest book of the Bible in all probability, the constellations are distinguished and named. Mention is made of the “morning star”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_28">Revelation 2:28</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS14_12">Isaiah 14:12</span>), the “seven stars” and “Pleiades,”“Orion,” “Arcturus,” the “Great Bear” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM5_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="AM5_8">Amos 5:8</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_9">Job 9:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_31">38:31</span>), “the crooked serpent,” Draco (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB26_13">Job 26:13</span>), the Dioscuri, or Gemini, “Castor and Pollux” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_11">Acts 28:11</span>). The stars were called “the host of heaven” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_26">Isaiah 40:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_22">Jeremiah 33:22</span>).<br>The oldest divisions of time were mainly based on the observation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, the “ordinances of heaven” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN1_14-18">Genesis 1:14-18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_33">Job 38:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_35">Jeremiah 31:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR33_25">33:25</span>). Such observations led to the division of the year into months and the mapping out of the appearances of the stars into twelve portions, which received from the Greeks the name of the “zodiac.” The word “Mazzaroth” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB38_32">Job 38:32</span>) means, as the margin notes, “the twelve signs” of the zodiac. Astronomical observations were also necessary among the Jews in order to the fixing of the proper time for sacred ceremonies, the “new moons,” the “passover,” etc. Many allusions are found to the display of God’s wisdom and power as seen in the starry heavens (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS8_">Psalm 8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS19_1-6">19:1-6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS51_6">Isaiah 51:6</span>, etc.)
