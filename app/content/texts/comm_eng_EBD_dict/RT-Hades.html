All the dead alike go into this place. To be buried, to go down to the grave, to descend into hades, are equivalent expressions. In the LXX. this word is the usual rendering of the Hebrew sheol, the common receptacle of the departed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN42_38">Genesis 42:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS139_8">Psalm 139:8</span>; Hos.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS13_14">13:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS14_9">Isaiah 14:9</span>). This term is of comparatively rare occurrence in the Greek New Testament. Our Lord speaks of Capernaum as being “brought down to hell” (hades), i.e., simply to the lowest debasement, (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_23">Matthew 11:23</span>).

David was left in the place of the dead, and his body saw corruption. Not so with Christ. According to ancient prophecy (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS30_3">Psalm 30:3</span>) he was recalled to life.<br>
