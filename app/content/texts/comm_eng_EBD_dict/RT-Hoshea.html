The original name of the son of Nun, afterwards called Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_8,16">Numbers 13:8, 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT32_44">Deuteronomy 32:44</span>).<br>(2.) <span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_20">1 Chronicles 27:20</span>. The ruler of Ephraim in David’s time.<br>(3.) The last king of Israel. He conspired against and slew his predecessor, Pekah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_16">Isaiah 7:16</span>), but did not ascend the throne till after an interregnum of warfare of eight years (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_1,2">2 Kings 17:1, 2</span>). Soon after this he submitted to Shalmaneser, the Assyrian king, who a second time invaded the land to punish Hoshea, because of his withholding tribute which he had promised to pay. A second revolt brought back the Assyrian king Sargon, who besieged Samaria, and carried the ten tribes away beyond the Euphrates, B.C. 720 (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K217_5,6">2 Kings 17:5, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K218_9-12">18:9-12</span>). No more is heard of Hoshea. He disappeared like “foam upon the water” (Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_7">10:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_11">13:11</span>).<br>
