One who, with Annas and Caiaphas, sat in judgment on the apostles Peter and John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_6">Acts 4:6</span>). He was of the kindred of the high priest; otherwise unknown.<br>(2.) The Hebrew name of Mark (q.v.). He is designated by this name in the acts of the Apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_12,25">12:12, 25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_5,13">13:5, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_37">15:37</span>).<br>(3.) THE APOSTLE, brother of James the “Greater” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_2">10:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_19">Mark 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_17">3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_35">10:35</span>). He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21"><span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span></span>) and Salome (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_56">Matthew 27:56</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK15_40">Mark 15:40</span>), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_20">Mark 1:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_3">Luke 5:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_27">John 19:27</span>). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth.<br>When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, “Behold the Lamb of God,” and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_36,37">John 1:36, 37</span>) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain.<br>Jesus again called them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4: 21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_1-11">Luke 5:1-11</span>), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples.<br>He became one of the innermost circle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_37">Mark 5:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_37">26:37</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK13_3">Mark 13:3</span>). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a “Boanerges” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_17">Mark 3:17</span>). This spirit once and again broke out (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20-24">Matthew <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN20_2">20:2</span>0-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_35-41">Mark 10:35-41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK9_49,54">Luke 9:49, 54</span>). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_15">John 18:15</span>). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_16,19,28">18:16, 19, 28</span>) and to the place of crucifixion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_26,27">19:26, 27</span>). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN21_1,7">21:1, 7</span>). We find Peter and John frequently after this together (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC3_1">Acts 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC4_13">4:13</span>). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_6">Acts 15:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GL2_9">Galatians 2:9</span>). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul’s last visit (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_15-40">Acts 21:15-40</span>). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_11">Revelation 1:11</span>). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_9">1:9</span>); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.<br>
