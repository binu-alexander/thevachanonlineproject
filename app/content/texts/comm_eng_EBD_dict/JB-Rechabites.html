Moses married a Kenite wife (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_16">Judges 1:16</span>), and Jael was the wife of “Heber the Kenite” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG4_17">4:17</span>). Saul also showed kindness to the Kenites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_6">1 Samuel 15:6</span>). The main body of the Kenites dwelt in cities, and adopted settled habits of life (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_29">30:29</span>); but Jehonadab forbade his descendants to drink wine or to live in cities. They were commanded to lead always a nomad life. They adhered to the law laid down by Jonadab, and were noted for their fidelity to the old-established custom of their family in the days of Jeremiah (35); and this feature of their character is referred to by the prophet for the purpose of giving point to his own exhortation. They are referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_14">Nehemiah 3:14</span> and 1 Chronicles 2:55. Dr. Wolff (1839) found in Arabia, near Mecca, a tribe claiming to be descendants of Jehonadab; and recently a Bedouin tribe has been found near the Dead Sea who also profess to be descendants of the same Kenite chief.<br>
