It was probably the chief ford of the Jordan in that district, and may have been that by which Jacob crossed when he returned from Mesopotamia, near the Jabbok (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN32_22">Genesis 32:22</span>), and at which Jephthah slew the Ephraimites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG12_4">Judges 12:4</span>). Nothing, however, is certainly known of it. (See BETHABARA.)
