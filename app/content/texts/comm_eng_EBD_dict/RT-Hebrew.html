In the New Testament there is the same contrast between Hebrews and foreigners (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC6_1">Acts 6:1</span>; Phil. <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC3_5">3:5</span>).<br>Derivation. (1.) The name is derived, according to some, from Eber(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_24">Genesis 10:24</span>), the ancestor of Abraham. The Hebrews are “sons of Eber” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_21">10:21</span>).<br>(2.) Others trace the name of a Hebrew root-word signifying “to pass over,” and hence regard it as meaning “the man who passed over,” viz., the Euphrates; or to the Hebrew word meaning “the region” or “country beyond,” viz., the land of Chaldea. This latter view is preferred. It is the more probable origin of the designation given to Abraham coming among the Canaanites as a man from beyond the Euphrates (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_13">Genesis 14:13</span>).<br>(3.) A third derivation of the word has been suggested, viz., that it is from the Hebrew word ’abhar, “to pass over,” whence ’ebher, in the sense of a“sojourner” or “passer through” as distinct from a “settler” in the land, and thus applies to the condition of Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB11_13">Hebrews 11:13</span>).<br>
