But the word (sha’al) so rendered here means simply and always to “request” or“demand.” The Hebrew had another word which is properly translated“borrow” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT28_12">Deuteronomy 28:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS37_21">Psalm 37:21</span>. It was well known that the parting was final. The Egyptians were so anxious to get the Israelites away out of their land that “they let them have what they asked” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_36">Exodus 12:36</span>, R.V.), or literally “made them to ask,” urged them to take whatever they desired and depart. (See LOAN.)
