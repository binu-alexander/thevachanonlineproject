It denotes also any kind of calumny, or evil-speaking, or abuse (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K121_10">1 Kings 21:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_45">Acts 13:45</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_6">18:6</span>, etc.). Our Lord was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to be the Son of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_65">Matthew 26:65</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT9_3">Matthew 9:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK2_7">Mark 2:7</span>). They who deny his Messiahship blaspheme Jesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK22_65">Luke 22:65</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_36">John 10:36</span>).<br>Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT12_31,32">Matthew 12:31, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_28,29">Mark 3:28, 29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_10">Luke 12:10</span>) is regarded by some as a continued and obstinate rejection of the gospel, and hence is an unpardonable sin, simply because as long as a sinner remains in unbelief he voluntarily excludes himself from pardon.<br>Others regard the expression as designating the sin of attributing to the power of Satan those miracles which Christ performed, or generally those works which are the result of the Spiritâ€™s agency.<br>
