It has been defined as a “miracle of knowledge, a declaration or description or representation of something future, beyond the power of human sagacity to foresee, discern, or conjecture.” (See PROPHET.) The great prediction which runs like a golden thread through the whole contents of the Old Testament is that regarding the coming and work of the Messiah; and the great use of prophecy was to perpetuate faith in his coming, and to prepare the world for that event. But there are many subordinate and intermediate prophecies also which hold an important place in the great chain of events which illustrate the sovereignty and all-wise overruling providence of God.<br>Then there are many prophecies regarding the Jewish nation, its founder Abraham (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_1-3">Genesis 12:1-3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_16">13:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_5">15:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN17_2,4-6">17:2, 4-6</span>, etc.), and his posterity, Isaac and Jacob and their descendants (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN12_7">12:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_14,15,17">13:14, 15, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN15_18-21">15:18-21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX3_8,17">Exodus 3:8, 17</span>), which have all been fulfilled. The twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy contains a series of predictions which are even now in the present day being fulfilled. In the writings of the prophets Isaiah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX2_18-21">2:18-21</span>), Jeremiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX27_3-7">27:3-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_11-14">29:11-14</span>), Ezekiel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX5_12">5:12</span>; 8), Daniel (8; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_26,27">9:26, 27</span>), Hosea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX9_17">9:17</span>), there are also many prophecies regarding the events which were to befall that people.<br>There is in like manner a large number of prophecies relating to those nations with which the Jews came into contact, as Tyre (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK26_3-5,14-21">Ezekiel 26:3-5, 14-21</span>), Egypt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK29_10,15">Ezekiel 29:10, 15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK30_6,12,13">30:6, 12, 13</span>), Ethiopia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NM3_8-10">Nahum 3:8-10</span>), Nineveh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NM1_10">Nahum 1:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NM2_8-13">2:8-13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NM3_17-19">3:17-19</span>), Babylon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS13_4">Isaiah 13:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_7">Jeremiah 51:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_27">Isaiah 44:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_38">Jeremiah 50:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR51_36,39,57">51:36, 39, 57</span>), the land of the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR47_4-7">Jeremiah 47:4-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK25_15-17">Ezekiel 25:15-17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_6-8">Amos 1:6-8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_4-7">Zephaniah 2:4-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC9_5-8">Zechariah 9:5-8</span>), and of the four great monarchies (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN2_39,40">Daniel 2:39, 40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN7_17-24">7:17-24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN8_9">8:9</span>).<br>But the great body of Old Testament prophecy relates directly to the advent of the Messiah, beginning with <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_15">Genesis 3:15</span>, the first great promise, and extending in ever-increasing fulness and clearness all through to the very close of the canon. The Messianic prophecies are too numerous to be quoted. “To him gave all the prophets witness.” (Comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="MC5_2">Micah 5:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG2_6-9">Haggai 2:6-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_14">Isaiah 7:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS9_6,7">9:6, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS11_1,2">11:1, 2</span>; 53; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS60_10,13">60:10, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS16_11">Psalm 16:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_18">68:18</span>.) Many predictions also were delivered by Jesus and his apostles. Those of Christ were very numerous. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_23">Matthew 10:23</span>:24; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_23">11:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT19_28">19:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT21_43,44">21:43, 44</span>; 24; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_31-46">25:31-46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT26_17-35,46,64">26:17-35, 46, 64</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_1">Mark 9:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK10_30">10:30</span>; 13; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK11_1-6,14">11:1-6, 14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_12-31,42,62">14:12-31, 42, 62</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK16_17">16:17</span>, etc.)
