It was famous also as being the birthplace or residence of Goliath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_4">1 Samuel 17:4</span>).<br>David fled from Saul to Achish, king of Gath (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10">1 Samuel 21:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_2-4">27:2-4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS56_">Psalm 56</span>), and his connection with it will account for the words in 2 Samuel 1:20. It was afterwards conquered by David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S28_1">2 Samuel 8:1</span>). It occupied a strong position on the borders of Judah and Philistia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10">1 Samuel 21:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_1">1 Chronicles 18:1</span>). Its site has been identified with the hill called Tell esSafieh, the Alba Specula of the Middle Ages, which rises 695 feet above the plain on its east edge. It is noticed on monuments about B.C.<br>1500. (See METHEGAMMAH.)
