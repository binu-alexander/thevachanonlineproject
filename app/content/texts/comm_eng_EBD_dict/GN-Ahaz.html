A grandson of Jonathan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_35">1 Chronicles 8:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R19_42">9:42</span>).<br>(2.) The son and successor of Jotham, king of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_">2 Kings 16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS7_-9">Isaiah 7-9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R228_">2 Chronicles 28</span>). He gave himself up to a life of wickedness and idolatry. Notwithstanding the remonstrances and warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and Micah, he appealed for help against Rezin, king of Damascus, and Pekah, king of Israel, who threatened Jerusalem, to Tiglath-pileser, the king of Assyria, to the great injury of his kingdom and his own humilating subjection to the Assyrians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K216_">2 Kings 16</span>:7, 9; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_29">15:29</span>). He also introduced among his people many heathen and idolatrous customs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS8_19">Isaiah 8:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS38_8">38:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_12">2 Kings 23:12</span>). He died at the age of thirty-five years, after reigning sixteen years (B.C. 740-724), and was succeeded by his son Hezekiah.<br>Because of his wickedness he was “not brought into the sepulchre of the kings.”
