This has been identified with the modern el-Kubeibeh, lying over 7 miles north-west of Jerusalem. This name, el-Kubeibeh, meaning “little dome,” is derived from the remains of the Crusaders’ church yet to be found there. Others have identified it with the modern Khurbet Khamasa i.e., “the ruins of Khamasa”, about 8 miles south-west of Jerusalem, where there are ruins also of a Crusaders’ church.<br>Its site, however has been much disputed.<br>
