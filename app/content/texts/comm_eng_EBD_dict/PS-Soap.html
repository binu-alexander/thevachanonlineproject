It does not appear that the Hebrews were acquainted with what is now called “soap,” which is a compound of alkaline carbonates with oleaginous matter. The word “purely” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_25">Isaiah 1:25</span>(R.V., “throughly;” marg., “as with lye”) is lit. “as with bor.” This word means “clearness,” and hence also that which makes clear, or pure, alkali.<br>“The ancients made use of alkali mingled with oil, instead of soap (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_30">Job 9:30</span>), and also in smelting metals, to make them melt and flow more readily and purely” (Gesenius).<br>
