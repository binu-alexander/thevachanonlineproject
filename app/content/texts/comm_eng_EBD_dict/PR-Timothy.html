His mother, Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned as eminent for their piety (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_5">2 Timothy 1:5</span>). We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_1">Acts 16:1</span>). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul’s second visit to Lystra (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_2">16:2</span>), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul’s first visit to that place (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T11_2">1 Timothy 1:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T23_11">2 Timothy 3:11</span>). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his “own son in the faith,” arranged that he should become his companion (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_3">Acts 16:3</span>), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T14_14">1 Timothy 4:14</span>), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_14">Acts 17:14</span>). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_15">17:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H13_2">1 Thessalonians 3:2</span>). We next find him at Corinth (<span class="bibleref" data-id="H11_1">1 Thessalonians <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_1">1:1</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="H21_1">2 Thessalonians 1:1</span>) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_22">Acts 19:22</span>), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC20_4">20:4</span>), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him (Phil. 1:1), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment (<span class="bibleref" data-id="HB13_23">Hebrews 13:23</span>). During the apostle’s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_13">2 Timothy 4:13</span>). According to tradition, after the apostle’s death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr’s grave.<br>
