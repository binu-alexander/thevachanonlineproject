A prophet in the reigns of David and Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_29">2 Chronicles 9:29</span></span>). He is first spoken of in connection with the arrangements David made for the building of the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S27_2,3,17">2 Samuel 7:2, 3, 17</span>), and next appears as the reprover of David on account of his sin with Bathsheba(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_1-14">12:1-14</span>). He was charged with the education of Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_25">12:25</span>), at whose inauguration to the throne he took a prominent part (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_8,10,11,22-45">1 Kings 1:8, 10, 11, 22-45</span>). His two sons, Zabad (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_36">1 Chronicles 2:36</span>) and Azariah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_5">1 Kings 4:5</span>) occupied places of honour at the kingâ€™s court. He last appears in assisting David in reorganizing the public worship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R229_25">2 Chronicles 29:25</span>).<br>He seems to have written a life of David, and also a life of Solomon (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_29">1 Chronicles 29:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_29"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_29">2 Chronicles 9:29</span></span>).<br>(2.)
