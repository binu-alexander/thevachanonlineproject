Thus priests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_41">Exodus 28:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_15">40:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_3">Numbers 3:3</span>), prophets (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K119_16">1 Kings 19:16</span>), and kings (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_16">1 Samuel 9:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S116_3">16:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S212_7">2 Samuel 12:7</span>) were anointed with oil, and so consecrated to their respective offices. The great Messiah is anointed “above his fellows” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_7">Psalm 45:7</span>); i.e., he embraces in himself all the three offices. The Greek form “Messias” is only twice used in the New Testament, in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_41">John 1:41</span> and 4:25 (R.V.,“Messiah”), and in the Old Testament the word Messiah, as the rendering of the Hebrew, occurs only twice (Dan 9:25, 26; R.V., “the anointed one”).<br>The first great promise (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN3_15">Genesis 3:15</span>) contains in it the germ of all the prophecies recorded in the Old Testament regarding the coming of the Messiah and the great work he was to accomplish on earth. The prophecies became more definite and fuller as the ages rolled on; the light shone more and more unto the perfect day. Different periods of prophetic revelation have been pointed out, (1) the patriarchal; (2) the Mosaic; (3) the period of David; (4) the period of prophetism, i.e., of those prophets whose works form a part of the Old Testament canon. The expectations of the Jews were thus kept alive from generation to generation, till the“fulness of the times,” when Messiah came, “made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law.” In him all these ancient prophecies have their fulfilment. Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, the great Deliverer who was to come.
