The destroying angel, sent to punish David for his vanity in taking a census of the people, was stayed in his work of destruction near a threshing-floor belonging to Araunah which was situated on Mount Moriah. Araunah offered it to David as a free gift, together with the oxen and the threshing instruments; but the king insisted on purchasing it at its full price (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_24">2 Samuel 24:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_24,25">1 Chronicles 21:24, 25</span>), for, according to the law of sacrifices, he could not offer to God what cost him nothing. On the same place Solomon afterwards erected the temple (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S224_16">2 Samuel 24:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R23_1">2 Chronicles 3:1</span>). (See ALTAR.)
