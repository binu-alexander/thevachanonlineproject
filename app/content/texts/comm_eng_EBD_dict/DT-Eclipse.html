Eclipses were regarded as tokens of Godâ€™s anger (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JL3_15">Joel 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_7">Job 9:7</span>). The darkness at the crucifixion has been ascribed to an eclipse(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_45">Matthew 27:45</span>); but on the other hand it is argued that the great intensity of darkness caused by an eclipse never lasts for more than six minutes, and this darkness lasted for three hours. Moreover, at the time of the Passover the moon was full, and therefore there could not be an eclipse of the sun, which is caused by an interposition of the moon between the sun and the earth.<br>
