The fullest account is given by Luke, who, no doubt, was informed by Peter, who was present on the occasion. What these evangelists record was an absolute historical reality, and not a mere vision.<br>The concurrence between them in all the circumstances of the incident is exact. John seems to allude to it also (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_14">John 1:14</span>). Forty years after the event Peter distinctly makes mention of it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P21_16-18">2 Peter 1:16-18</span>). In describing the sanctification of believers, Paul also seems to allude to this majestic and glorious appearance of our Lord on the “holy mount” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="RM12_2">Romans 12:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C23_18">2 Corinthians 3:18</span>).<br>The place of the transfiguration was probably Mount Hermon (q.v.), and not Mount Tabor, as is commonly supposed.<br>
