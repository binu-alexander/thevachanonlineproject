There were 700 Benjamites who were so skilled in its use that with the left hand they “could sling stones at a hair breadth, and not miss” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_16">Judges 20:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_2">1 Chronicles 12:2</span>). It was used by the Israelites in war (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_25">2 Kings 3:25</span>). (See ARMS.) The words in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR26_8">Proverbs 26:8</span>, “As he that bindeth a stone in a sling,” etc.<br>(Authorized Version), should rather, as in the Revised Version, be “As a bag of gems in a heap of stones,” etc.<br>
