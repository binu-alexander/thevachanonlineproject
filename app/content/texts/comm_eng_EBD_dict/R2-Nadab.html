The eldest of Aaronâ€™s four sons (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX6_23">Exodus 6:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_2">Numbers 3:2</span>). He with his brothers and their father were consecrated as priests of Jehovah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_1">Exodus 28:1</span>). He afterwards perished with Abihu for the sin of offering strange fire on the altar of burnt-offering (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV10_1,2">Leviticus 10:1,2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_4">Numbers 3:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_60">26:60</span>).<br>(2.) The son and successor of Jeroboam, the king of Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_20">1 Kings 14:20</span>).<br>While engaged with all Israel in laying siege to Gibbethon, a town of southern Dan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_44">Joshua 19:44</span>), a conspiracy broke out in his army, and he was slain by Baasha (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_25-28">1 Kings 15:25-28</span>), after a reign of two years (B.C.<br>955-953). The assassination of Nadab was followed by that of his whole house, and thus this great Ephraimite family became extinct (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_29">1 Kings 15:29</span>).<br>(3.) One of the sons of Shammai in the tribe of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_28,30">1 Chronicles 2:28, 30</span>).<br>
