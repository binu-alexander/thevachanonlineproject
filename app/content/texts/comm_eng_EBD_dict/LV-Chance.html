By coincidence (Gr. sungkuria) the priest came down, that is, by the conjunction of two things, in fact, which were previously constituted a pair in the providence of God. In the result they fell together according to the omniscient Designer’s plan. This is the true theory of the divine government.” Compare the meeting of Philip with the Ethiopian (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_26,27">Acts 8:26, 27</span>). There is no “chance” in God’s empire.<br>“Chance” is only another word for our want of knowledge as to the way in which one event falls in with another (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_9">1 Samuel 6:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_11">Ecclesiastes 9:11</span>).<br>
