It was here that the terrible outrage was committed on the Levite’s concubine which led to the almost utter extirpation of the tribe of Benjamin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG19_">Judges 19</span>; 20), only six hundred men surviving after a succession of disastrous battles. This was the birthplace of Saul, and continued to be his residence after he became king (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_26">1 Samuel <span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_26">10:26</span></span>; 11:4; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_34"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S115_34">15:34</span></span>). It was reckoned among the ancient sanctuaries of Palestine (10:26; 15:34; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_19">23:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_1">26:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S221_6-10">2 Samuel 21:6-10</span>), and hence it is called “Gibeah of God” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5">1 Samuel 10:5</span>, R.V. marg.). It has been identified with the modern Tell el-Ful (i.e., “hill of the bean”), about 3 miles north of Jerusalem.<br>
