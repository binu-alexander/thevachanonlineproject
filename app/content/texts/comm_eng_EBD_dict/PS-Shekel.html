It is estimated at 220 English grains, or a little more than half an ounce avoirdupois. The “shekel of the sanctuary” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_13">Exodus 30:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_47">Numbers 3:47</span>) was equal to twenty gerahs (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK45_12">Ezekiel 45:12</span>). There were shekels of gold (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R121_25">1 Chronicles 21:25</span>), of silver (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_8">1 Samuel 9:8</span></span>), of brass(<span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_5">17:5</span>), and of iron (7). When it became a coined piece of money, the shekel of gold was equivalent to about 2 pound of our money. Six gold shekels, according to the later Jewish system, were equal in value to fifty silver ones.<br>The temple contribution, with which the public sacrifices were bought(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_13"><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_13">Exodus 30:13</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R224_6">2 Chronicles 24:6</span>), consisted of one common shekel, or a sanctuary half-shekel, equal to two Attic drachmas. The coin, a stater(q.v.), which Peter found in the fish’s mouth paid this contribution for both him and Christ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_24,27">Matthew 17:24, 27</span>). A zuza, or quarter of a shekel, was given by Saul to Samuel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S19_8">1 Samuel 9:8</span></span>).<br>
