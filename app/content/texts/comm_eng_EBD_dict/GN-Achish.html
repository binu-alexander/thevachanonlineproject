(1.) The king with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_10-15">1 Samuel 21:10-15</span>). He is called Abimelech in the superscription of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS34_">Psalm 34</span>. It was probably this same king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S127_5-12">1 Samuel 27:5-12</span>). Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S128_1,2">1 Samuel 28:1,2</span>), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S129_2-11">1 Samuel 29:2-11</span>). David remained with Achish a year and four months. (2.) Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that Solomon put him to death (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_39-46">1 Kings 2:39-46</span>).<br>
