It was first visited by Paul and Barnabas from Antioch-in-Pisidia during the apostleâ€™s first missionary journey (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_50,51">Acts 13:50, 51</span>). Here they were persecuted by the Jews, and being driven from the city, they fled to Lystra. They afterwards returned to Iconium, and encouraged the church which had been founded there(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC14_21,22">14:21,22</span>). It was probably again visited by Paul during his third missionary journey along with Silas (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_23">18:23</span>). It is the modern Konieh, at the foot of Mount Taurus, about 120 miles inland from the Mediterranean.<br>
