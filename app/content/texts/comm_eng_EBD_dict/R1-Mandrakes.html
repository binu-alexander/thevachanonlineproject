Many interpretations have been given of this word dudaim. It has been rendered “violets,” “Lilies,” “jasmines,”“truffles or mushrooms,” “flowers,” the “citron,” etc. The weight of authority is in favour of its being regarded as the Mandragora officinalis of botanists, “a near relative of the night-shades, the ‘apple of Sodom’ and the potato plant.” It possesses stimulating and narcotic properties(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_14-16"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN30_14-16">Genesis 30:14-16</span></span>). The fruit of this plant resembles the potato-apple in size, and is of a pale orange colour. It has been called the “love-apple.” The Arabs call it “Satan’s apple.” It still grows near Jerusalem, and in other parts of Palestine.<br>
