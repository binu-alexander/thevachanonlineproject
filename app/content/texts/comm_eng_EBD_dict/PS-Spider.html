It is said of the wicked by Isaiah that they “weave the spider’s web” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB59_5">59:5</span>), i.e., their works and designs are, like the spider’s web, vain and useless. The Hebrew word here used is ’akkabish, “a swift weaver.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_28">Proverbs 30:28</span> a different Hebrew word (semamith) is used. It is rendered in the Vulgate by stellio, and in the Revised Version by “lizard.” It may, however, represent the spider, of which there are, it is said, about seven hundred species in Palestine.<br>
