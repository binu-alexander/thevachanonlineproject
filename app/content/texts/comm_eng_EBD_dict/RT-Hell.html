In Scripture there are three words so rendered:(1.) Sheol, occurring in the Old Testament sixty-five times. This word sheol is derived from a root-word meaning “to ask,” “demand;” hence insatiableness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR30_15,16">Proverbs 30:15, 16</span>). It is rendered “grave” thirty-one times(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN37_35">Genesis 37:35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN42_38">42:38</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN44_29,31">44:29, 31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_6">1 Samuel 2:6</span>, etc.). The Revisers have retained this rendering in the historical books with the original word in the margin, while in the poetical books they have reversed this rule.<br>In thirty-one cases in the Authorized Version this word is rendered “hell,” the place of disembodied spirits. The inhabitants of sheol are “the congregation of the dead” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR21_16">Proverbs 21:16</span>). It is (a) the abode of the wicked (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU16_33">Numbers 16:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB24_19">Job 24:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS9_17">Psalm 9:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS31_17">31:17</span>, etc.); (b) of the good (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS16_10">Psalm 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS30_3">30:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS49_15">49:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS86_13">86:13</span>, etc.).<br>Sheol is described as deep (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB11_8">Job 11:8</span>), dark (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB10_21,22">10:21, 22</span>), with bars (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB17_16">17:16</span>).<br>The dead “go down” to it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU16_30,33">Numbers 16:30, 33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK31_15,16,17">Ezekiel 31:15, 16, 17</span>).<br>(2.) The Greek word hades of the New Testament has the same scope of signification as sheol of the Old Testament. It is a prison (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P13_19">1 Peter 3:19</span>), with gates and bars and locks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_18">Matthew 16:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV1_18">Revelation 1:18</span>), and it is downward (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT11_23">Matthew 11:23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK10_15">Luke 10:15</span>).<br>The righteous and the wicked are separated. The blessed dead are in that part of hades called paradise (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK23_43">Luke 23:43</span>). They are also said to be in Abraham’s bosom (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_22">Luke 16:22</span>).<br>(3.) Gehenna, in most of its occurrences in the Greek New Testament, designates the place of the lost (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_33">Matthew 23:33</span>). The fearful nature of their condition there is described in various figurative expressions(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT8_12">Matthew 8:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_42">13:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT22_13">22:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT25_30">25:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_24">Luke 16:24</span>, etc.).
