Rings were used as a signet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN38_18">Genesis 38:18</span>). They were given as a token of investment with authority (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_42">Genesis 41:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET3_8-10">Esther 3:8-10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ET8_2">8:2</span>), and of favour and dignity (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK15_22">Luke 15:22</span>). They were generally worn by rich men (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM2_2">James 2:2</span>). They are mentioned by Isiah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JM3_21">3:21</span>) among the adornments of Hebrew women.<br>
