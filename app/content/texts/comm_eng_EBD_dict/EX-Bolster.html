A different Hebrew word (meraashoth’) is used for “bolster” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S126_7,11,16">1 Samuel 26:7, 11, 16</span>). It is rightly rendered in Revised Version “at his head.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN28_11,18">Genesis 28:11, 18</span> the Authorized Version renders it “for his pillows,” and the Revised Version “under his head.” In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK13_18,20">Ezekiel 13:18, 20</span> another Hebrew word (kesathoth) is used, properly denoting “cushions” or “pillows,” as so rendered both in the Authorized and the Revised Version.<br>
