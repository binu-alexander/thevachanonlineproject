He was with Paul in Jerusalem, and the Jews, supposing that the apostle had brought him with him into the temple, raised a tumult which resulted in Paul’s imprisonment. (See TEMPLE, HEROD’S.) In writing to Timothy, the apostle says, “Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="T24_20">2 Timothy 4:20</span>).<br>This must refer to some event not noticed in the Acts.<br>
