The son of Zebedee and Salome; an elder brother of John the apostle. He was one of the twelve. He was by trade a fisherman, in partnership with Peter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20">Matthew 20:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_56">27:56</span>). With John and Peter he was present at the transfiguration (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_1">Matthew 17:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK9_2">Mark 9:2</span>), at the raising of Jairus’s daughter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_37-43">Mark 5:37-43</span>), and in the garden with our Lord(<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_33">14:33</span>). Because, probably, of their boldness and energy, he and John were called Boanerges, i.e., “sons of thunder.” He was the first martyr among the apostles, having been beheaded by King Herod Agrippa (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_1,2">Acts 12:1, 2</span>), A.D. 44. (Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_21">Matthew 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT20_20-23">20:20-23</span>).<br>(2.) The son of Alphaeus, or Cleopas, “the brother” or near kinsman or cousin of our Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GL1_18,19">Galatians 1:18, 19</span>), called James “the Less,” or “the Little,” probably because he was of low stature. He is mentioned along with the other apostles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_3">Matthew 10:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_18">Mark 3:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK6_15">Luke 6:15</span>). He had a separate interview with our Lord after his resurrection (<span class="bibleref" data-id="C115_7">1 Corinthians 15:7</span>), and is mentioned as one of the apostles of the circumcision (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_13">Acts 1:13</span>). He appears to have occupied the position of head of the Church at Jerusalem, where he presided at the council held to consider the case of the Gentiles (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_17">Acts 12:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC15_13-29">15:13-29</span>: <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC21_18-24">21:18-24</span>). This James was the author of the epistle which bears his name.<br>
