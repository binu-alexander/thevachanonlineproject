Our Lord alludes here to the gnat in a proverbial expression probably in common use, “who strain out the gnat;” the words in the Authorized Version, “strain at a gnat,” being a mere typographical error, which has been corrected in the Revised Version. The custom of filtering wine for this purpose was common among the Jews. It was founded on <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV11_23">Leviticus 11:23</span>. It is supposed that the “lice,” <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX8_16">Exodus 8:16</span> (marg. R.V., “sand-flies”), were a species of gnat.<br>
