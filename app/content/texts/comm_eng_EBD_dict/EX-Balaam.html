He resided at Pethor (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT23_4">Deuteronomy 23:4</span>), in Mesopotamia (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU23_7">Numbers 23:7</span>). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam“from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,” to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak’s wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_15,16">2 Peter 2:15, 16</span>) to this as an historical event. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC6_5">Micah 6:5</span> reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU25_">Numbers 25</span>). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak(<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_8"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU31_8">Numbers 31:8</span></span>).<br>The “doctrine of Balaam” is spoken of in <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV2_14">Revelation 2:14</span>, in allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin. (See NICOLAITANES.) Balaam was constrained to utter prophecies regarding the future of Israel of wonderful magnificence and beauty of expression (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU24_5-9,17">Numbers 24:5-9, 17</span>).<br>
