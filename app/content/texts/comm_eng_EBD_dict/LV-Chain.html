A chain of gold was placed about Josephâ€™s neck (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN41_42">Genesis 41:42</span>); and one was promised to Daniel(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN5_7">5:7</span>). It is used as a symbol of sovereignty (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK16_11">Ezekiel 16:11</span>). The breast-plate of the high-priest was fastened to the ephod by golden chains(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_17,21">Exodus 39:17, 21</span>).<br>(2.) It was used as an ornament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR1_9">Proverbs 1:9</span>; Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PR1_10">1:10</span>). The Midianites adorned the necks of their camels with chains (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_21,26">Judges 8:21, 26</span>).<br>(3.) Chains were also used as fetters wherewith prisoners were bound(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21">Judges 16:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_34">2 Samuel 3:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K225_7">2 Kings 25:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR39_7">Jeremiah 39:7</span>). Paul was in this manner bound to a Roman soldier (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC28_20">Acts 28:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EP6_20">Ephesians 6:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="T21_16">2 Timothy 1:16</span>). Sometimes, for the sake of greater security, the prisoner was attached by two chains to two soldiers, as in the case of Peter (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_6">Acts 12:6</span>).<br>
