On the early Babylonian monuments all Syria, including Palestine, is known as “the land of the Amorites.” The southern slopes of the mountains of Judea are called the “mount of the Amorites” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_7,19,20">Deuteronomy 1:7, 19, 20</span>). They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_7"><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_7">Genesis 14:7</span></span>) to Hebron (13. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN13_8">13:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_8">Deuteronomy 3:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_46-48">4:46-48</span>), embracing “all Gilead and all Bashan” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_10">Deuteronomy 3:10</span>), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT4_49">4:49</span>), the land of the “two kings of the Amorites,” Sihon and Og (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT31_4">Deuteronomy 31:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS2_10">Joshua 2:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS9_10">9:10</span>). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_10">10:10</span>). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_8">Joshua 11:8</span>). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_14">1 Samuel 7:14</span>). The discrepancy supposed to exist between <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_44"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_44">Deuteronomy 1:44</span></span> and <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_45"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_45">Numbers 14:45</span></span> is explained by the circumstance that the terms “Amorites” and“Amalekites” are used synonymously for the “Canaanites.” In the same way we explain the fact that the “Hivites” of <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN34_2">Genesis 34:2</span> are the“Amorites” of 48:22. Comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS10_6">Joshua 10:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_19">11:19</span> with 2 Samuel 21:2; also <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_45"><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU14_45">Numbers 14:45</span></span> with <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_44"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_44">Deuteronomy 1:44</span></span>. The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last “of the remnant of the giants” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_11">Deuteronomy 3:11</span>).<br>Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, “Shenir,” the name they gave to Mount Hermon(<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_9">Deuteronomy 3:9</span>).<br>
