At the time of Israel’s entrance into the Promised Land, Og came out against them, but was utterly routed (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU21_33-35">Numbers 21:33-35</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT3_1-7">Deuteronomy 3:1-7</span>). This country extended from Gilead in the south to Hermon in the north, and from the Jordan on the west to Salcah on the east. Along with the half of Gilead it was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_29-31">Joshua 13:29-31</span>). Golan, one of its cities, became a “city of refuge” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS21_27">Joshua 21:27</span>). Argob, in Bashan, was one of Solomon’s commissariat districts (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_13">1 Kings 4:13</span>). The cities of Bashan were taken by Hazael (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K210_33">2 Kings 10:33</span>), but were soon after reconquered by Jehoash (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K213_25">2 Kings 13:25</span>), who overcame the Syrians in three battles, according to the word of Elisha (19). From this time Bashan almost disappears from history, although we read of the wild cattle of its rich pastures (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK39_18">Ezekiel 39:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS22_12">Psalm 22:12</span>), the oaks of its forests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS2_13">Isaiah 2:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK27_6">Ezekiel 27:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC11_2">Zechariah 11:2</span>), and the beauty of its extensive plains(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM4_1">Amos 4:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR50_19">Jeremiah 50:19</span>). Soon after the conquest, the name “Gilead” was given to the whole country beyond Jordan. After the Exile, Bashan was divided into four districts, (1.) Gaulonitis, or Jaulan, the most western; (2.) Auranitis, the Hauran (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EK47_16">Ezekiel 47:16</span>); (3.) Argob or Trachonitis, now the Lejah; and (4.) Batanaea, now Ard-el-Bathanyeh, on the east of the Lejah, with many deserted towns almost as perfect as when they were inhabited. (See HAURAN.)
