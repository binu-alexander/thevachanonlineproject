An old royal city of the Canaanites, which was destroyed by Joshua (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS12_24">Joshua 12:24</span>). Jeroboam chose it for his residence, and he removed to it from Shechem, which at first he made the capital of his kingdom. It remained the chief residence of the kings of Israel till Omri took Samaria (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K114_17">1 Kings 14:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K115_21">15:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_6,8">16:6, 8</span>, etc.). Here Zimri perished amid the flames of the palace to which in his despair he had set fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K116_18">1 Kings 16:18</span>), and here Menahem smote Shallum (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K215_14,16">2 Kings 15:14, 16</span>).<br>Solomon refers to its beauty (Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K26_4">6:4</span>). It has been identified with the modern mud hamlet Teiasir, 11 miles north of Shechem. Others, however, would identify it with Telluza, a village about 6 miles east of Samaria.<br>(2.)
