These were,(1.) The kinnor, the “harp.” (2.) The nebel, “a skin bottle,” rendered“psaltery.” (3.) The sabbeka, or “sackbut,” a lute or lyre. (4.) The gittith, occurring in the title of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS8_">Psalm 8</span>; 8; 84. (5.) Minnim (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS150_4">Psalm 150:4</span>), rendered “stringed instruments;” in <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS45_8">Psalm 45:8</span>, in the form minni, probably the apocopated (i.e., shortened) plural, rendered, Authorized Version, “whereby,” and in the Revised Version “stringed instruments.”(6.) Machalath, in the titles of <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS53_">Psalm 53</span> and 88; supposed to be a kind of lute or guitar.<br>Of wind instruments mention is made of, (1.) The ‘ugab (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN4_21">Genesis 4:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB21_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB21_12">Job 21:12</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB30_31">30:31</span>), probably the so-called Pan’s pipes or syrinx. (2.) The qeren or “horn” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_5">Joshua 6:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R125_5">1 Chronicles 25:5</span>). (3.) The shophar, rendered“trumpet” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS6_4,6,8">Joshua 6:4, 6, 8</span>). The word means “bright,” and may have been so called from the clear, shrill sound it emitted. It was often used(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_13">Exodus 19:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_10">Numbers 10:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG7_16,18">Judges 7:16, 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S113_3">1 Samuel 13:3</span>). (4.) The hatsotserah, or straight trumpet (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS98_6">Psalm 98:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU10_1-10">Numbers 10:1-10</span>). This name is supposed by some to be an onomatopoetic word, intended to imitate the pulse-like sound of the trumpet, like the Latin taratantara.<br>Some have identified it with the modern trombone. (5.) The halil, i.e,“bored through,” a flute or pipe (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5">1 Samuel 10:5</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_40">1 Kings 1:40</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS5_12">Isaiah 5:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR48_36">Jeremiah 48:36</span>) which is still used in Palestine. (6.) The sumponyah, rendered “dulcimer” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_5"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_5">Daniel 3:5</span></span>), probably a sort of bagpipe. (7.) The maskrokith’a (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_5"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DN3_5">Daniel 3:5</span></span>), rendered “flute,” but its precise nature is unknown.<br>Of instruments of percussion mention is made of, (1.) The toph, an instrument of the drum kind, rendered “timbrel” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX15_20">Exodus 15:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB21_12"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JB21_12">Job 21:12</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_25">Psalm 68:25</span>); also “tabret” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN31_27">Genesis 31:27</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS24_8">Isaiah 24:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S110_5">1 Samuel 10:5</span></span>).<br>(2.) The paamon, the “bells” on the robe of the high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_33">Exodus 28:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_25">39:25</span>). (3.) The tseltselim, “cymbals” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_5">2 Samuel 6:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS150_5">Psalm 150:5</span>), which are struck together and produce a loud, clanging sound. Metsilloth, “bells” on horses and camels for ornament, and metsiltayim, “cymbals” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R113_8">1 Chronicles 13:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_10">Ezra 3:10</span>, etc.). These words are all derived from the same root, tsalal, meaning “to tinkle.” (4.) The menaan’im, used only in <span class="bibleref" data-id="S26_5">2 Samuel 6:5</span>, rendered “cornets” (R.V., “castanets”); in the Vulgate, “sistra,” an instrument of agitation. (5.) The shalishim, mentioned only in 1 Samuel 18:6, rendered “instruments of music” (marg. of R.V., “triangles or three-stringed instruments”).<br>The words in <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC2_8">Ecclesiastes 2:8</span>, “musical instruments, and that of all sorts,” Authorized Version, are in the Revised Version “concubines very many.”
