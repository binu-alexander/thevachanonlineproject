It was assigned to Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_3">Joshua 13:3</span>), and afterwards to Dan (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS19_43">19:43</span>), but came again into the full possession of the Philistines (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_10">1 Samuel 5:10</span></span>). It was the last place to which the Philistines carried the ark before they sent it back to Israel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="S15_10">1 Samuel 5:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_1-8">6:1-8</span>). There was here a noted sanctuary of Baal-zebub (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K21_2,3,6,16">2 Kings 1: 2, 3, 6, 16</span>). Now the small village Akir.
