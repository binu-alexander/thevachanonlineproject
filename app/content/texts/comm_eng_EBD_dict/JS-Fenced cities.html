Cities, so called, had walls, and were thus fenced. The fortifications consisted of one or two walls, on which were towers or parapets at regular intervals (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R232_5">2 Chronicles 32:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR31_38">Jeremiah 31:38</span>). Around ancient Jerusalem were three walls, on one of which were ninety towers, on the second fourteen, and on the third sixty. The tower of Hananeel, near the north-east corner of the city wall, is frequently referred to (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_1">Nehemiah 3:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH12_39">12:39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC14_10">Zechariah 14:10</span>).<br>The gateways of such cities were also fortified (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH2_8">Nehemiah 2:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_3,6">3:3, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_2,3">Judges 16:2, 3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_7">1 Samuel 23:7</span>).<br>The Hebrews found many fenced cities when they entered the Promised Land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU13_28">Numbers 13:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU32_17,34-42">32:17, 34-42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_12,13">Joshua 11:12, 13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_27-33">Judges 1:27-33</span>), and we may estimate the strength of some of these cities from the fact that they were long held in possession by the Canaanites. The Jebusites, e.g., were enabled to hold possession of Jerusalem till the time of David (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S25_6,7">2 Samuel 5:6, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R111_5">1 Chronicles 11:5</span>).<br>Several of the kings of Israel and Judah distinguished themselves as fortifiers or “builders” of cities.<br>
