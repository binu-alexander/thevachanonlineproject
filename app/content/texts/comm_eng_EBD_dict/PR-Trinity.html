This word is derived from the Gr. trias, first used by Theophilus (A.D. 168-183), or from the Lat. trinitas, first used by Tertullian (A.D. 220), to express this doctrine. The propositions involved in the doctrine are these: 1. That God is one, and that there is but one God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT6_4">Deuteronomy 6:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_60">1 Kings 8:60</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_6">Isaiah 44:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK12_29,32">Mark 12:29, 32</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN10_30">John 10:30</span>). 2. That the Father is a distinct divine Person (hypostasis, subsistentia, persona, suppositum intellectuale), distinct from the Son and the Holy Spirit. 3. That Jesus Christ was truly God, and yet was a Person distinct from the Father and the Holy Spirit. 4. That the Holy Spirit is also a distinct divine Person.<br>
