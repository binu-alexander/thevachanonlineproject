It is the Aramaic dialect, as it is sometimes called, as distinguished from the Hebrew dialect. It was the language of commerce and of social intercourse in Western Asia, and after the Exile gradually came to be the popular language of Palestine. It is called“Syrian” in 2 Kings 18:26. Some isolated words in this language are preserved in the New Testament (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT5_22">Matthew 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT6_24">6:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT16_17">16:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_46">27:46</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK3_17">Mark 3:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_41">5:41</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK7_34">7:34</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_36">14:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_19">Acts 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C116_22">1 Corinthians 16:22</span>). These are specimens of the vernacular language of Palestine at that period. The term“Hebrew” was also sometimes applied to the Chaldee because it had become the language of the Hebrews (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JN5_2">John 5:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN19_20">19:20</span>).<br>
