The Roman anchor, like the modern one, had two teeth or flukes. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="HB6_19">Hebrews 6:19</span> the word is used metaphorically for that which supports or keeps one steadfast in the time of trial or of doubt. It is an emblem of hope.<br>“If you fear, Put all your trust in God: that anchor holds.”
