It was one of the stones on the breastplate of the high priest(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_20">Exodus 28:20</span>; R.V. marg., “chalcedony;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX39_13">39:13</span>). The colour of the wheels in Ezekiel’s vision was as the colour of a beryl stone (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX1_16">1:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX10_9">10:9</span>; R.V.,“stone of Tarshish”). It is mentioned in Cant. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX5_14">5:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DN10_6">Daniel 10:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV21_20">Revelation 21:20</span>. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK28_13">Ezekiel 28:13</span> the LXX. render the word by “chrysolite,” which the Jewish historian Josephus regards as its proper translation. This also is the rendering given in the Authorized Version in the margin. That was a gold-coloured gem, the topaz of ancient authors.<br>
