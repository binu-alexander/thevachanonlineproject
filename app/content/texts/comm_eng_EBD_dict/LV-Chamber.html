This was the “guest chamber” where entertainments were prepared (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MK14_14">Mark 14:14</span>). There were also “chambers within chambers” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K122_25">1 Kings 22:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K29_2">2 Kings 9:2</span>). To enter into a chamber is used metaphorically of prayer and communion with God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS26_20">Isaiah 26:20</span>).<br>The “chambers of the south” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB9_9">Job 9:9</span>) are probably the constelations of the southern hemisphere. The “chambers of imagery”, i.e., chambers painted with images, as used by Ezekiel (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB8_12">8:12</span>), is an expression denoting the vision the prophet had of the abominations practised by the Jews in Jerusalem.<br>
