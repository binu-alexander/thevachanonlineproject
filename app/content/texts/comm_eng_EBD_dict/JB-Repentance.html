(1.) The verb metamelomai is used of a change of mind, such as to produce regret or even remorse on account of sin, but not necessarily a change of heart. This word is used with reference to the repentance of Judas (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT27_3">Matthew 27:3</span>).<br>(2.) Metanoeo, meaning to change one’s mind and purpose, as the result of after knowledge. This verb, with (3) the cognate noun metanoia, is used of true repentance, a change of mind and purpose and life, to which remission of sin is promised.<br>Evangelical repentance consists of (1) a true sense of one’s own guilt and sinfulness; (2) an apprehension of God’s mercy in Christ; (3) an actual hatred of sin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_128">Psalm 119:128</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB42_5,6">Job 42:5, 6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C27_10">2 Corinthians 7:10</span>) and turning from it to God; and (4) a persistent endeavour after a holy life in a walking with God in the way of his commandments.<br>The true penitent is conscious of guilt (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_4,9">Psalm 51:4, 9</span>), of pollution (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_5,7,10">51:5, 7, 10</span>), and of helplessness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_11">51:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS109_21,22">109:21, 22</span>). Thus he apprehends himself to be just what God has always seen him to be and declares him to be. But repentance comprehends not only such a sense of sin, but also an apprehension of mercy, without which there can be no true repentance(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_1">Psalm 51:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS130_4">130:4</span>).<br>
