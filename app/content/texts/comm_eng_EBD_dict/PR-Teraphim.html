She pointed it out to the soldiers, and alleged that David was confined to his bed by a sudden illness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S119_13-16">1 Samuel 19:13-16</span>). Thus she gained time for David’s escape. It seems strange to read of teraphim, images of ancestors, preserved for superstitious purposes, being in the house of David. Probably they had been stealthily brought by Michal from her father’s house. “Perhaps,” says Bishop Wordsworth, “Saul, forsaken by God and possessed by the evil spirit, had resorted to teraphim (as he afterwards resorted to witchcraft); and God overruled evil for good, and made his very teraphim (by the hand of his own daughter) to be an instrument for David’s escape.”, Deane’s David, p. 32. Josiah attempted to suppress this form of idolatry (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_24">2 Kings 23:24</span>). The ephod and teraphim are mentioned together in Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="K23_4">3:4</span>. It has been supposed by some(Cheyne’s Hosea) that the “ephod” here mentioned, and also in <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG8_24-27">Judges 8:24-27</span>, was not the part of the sacerdotal dress so called (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX28_6-14">Exodus 28:6-14</span>), but an image of Jehovah overlaid with gold or silver (comp.<br><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG17_,18">Judges 17, 18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S121_9">1 Samuel 21:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_6,9">23:6, 9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_7,8">30:7, 8</span>), and is thus associated with the teraphim.
