It contained water where with LAVER the priests washed their hands and feet when they entered the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_32">40:32</span>). It stood in the court between the altar and the door of the tabernacle (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_19,21">30:19, 21</span>).<br>In the temple there were ten lavers used for the sacrifices, and the molten sea for the ablutions of the priests (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_6">2 Chronicles 4:6</span></span>). The position and uses of these are described 1 Kings 7:23-39; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_6"><span class="bibleref" data-id="R24_6">2 Chronicles 4:6</span></span>. The “molten sea” was made of copper, taken from Tibhath and Chun, cities of Hadarezer, king of Zobah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R118_8">1 Chronicles 18:8</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K17_23-26">1 Kings 7:23-26</span>).<br>No lavers are mentioned in the second temple.<br>
