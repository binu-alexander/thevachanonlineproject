He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth in descent from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S122_20-23">1 Samuel 22:20-23</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S123_6">23:6</span>). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S130_7">1 Samuel 30:7</span>). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R115_11">1 Chronicles 15:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_26">1 Kings 2:26</span>) and the “king’s companion” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="R127_34">1 Chronicles 27:34</span>). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David’s reign (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_4">1 Kings 4:4</span>). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S12_30-36">1 Samuel 2:30-36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K11_19">1 Kings 1:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K12_26,27">2:26, 27</span>). Zadok now became sole high priest. In <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK2_26">Mark 2:26</span>, reference is made to an occurrence in “the days of Abiathar the high priest.” But from 1 Samuel 22, we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to.<br>Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV24_9">Leviticus 24:9</span>) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them.<br>
