In <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB39_19">Job 39:19</span>, instead of “thunder,” as in the Authorized Version, the Revised Version translates (ra’amah) by “quivering main” (marg., “shaking”).<br>Thunder accompanied the giving of the law at Sinai (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_16">Exodus 19:16</span>). It was regarded as the voice of God (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB37_2">Job 37:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_13">Psalm 18:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS81_7">81:7</span>; comp. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN12_29">John 12:29</span>). In answer to Samuel’s prayer (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S112_17,18">1 Samuel 12:17, 18</span>), God sent thunder, and “all the people greatly feared,” for at such a season (the wheat-harvest) thunder and rain were almost unknown in Palestine.<br>
