He is supposed to have been the Chuza, Herod’s steward, whose wife was one of those women who“ministered unto the Lord of their substance” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK8_3">Luke 8:3</span>). This officer came to Jesus at Cana and besought him to go down to Capernaum and heal his son, who lay there at the point of death. Our Lord sent him away with the joyful assurance that his son was alive.<br>
