That on the morrow after the Passover Sabbath a sheaf of new corn should be waved by the priest before the altar (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_5,6,10,12">Leviticus 23:5, 6, 10, 12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_12">2:12</span>).<br>(2.) That at the feast of Pentecost two loaves of leavened bread, made from the new flour, were to be waved in like manner (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_15,17">Leviticus 23:15, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_26">Numbers 28:26</span>).<br>(3.) The feast of Tabernacles was an acknowledgement that the fruits of the harvest were from the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_16">Exodus 23:16</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_22">34:22</span>).<br>(4.) Every individual, besides, was required to consecrate to God a portion of the first-fruits of the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_29">Exodus 22:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_19">23:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_26">34:26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU15_20,21">Numbers 15:20, 21</span>).<br>(5.) The law enjoined that no fruit was to be gathered from newly-planted fruit-trees for the first three years, and that the first-fruits of the fourth year were to be consecrated to the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV19_23-25">Leviticus 19:23-25</span>). Jeremiah(<span class="bibleref" data-id="LV2_3">2:3</span>) alludes to the ordinance of “first-fruits,” and hence he must have been acquainted with the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, where the laws regarding it are recorded.<br>
