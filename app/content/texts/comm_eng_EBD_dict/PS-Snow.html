The snow on the tops of the Lebanon range is almost always within view throughout the whole year. The word is frequently used figuratively by the sacred writers(<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB24_19">Job 24:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS51_7">Psalm 51:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS68_14">68:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_18">Isaiah 1:18</span>). It is mentioned only once in the historical books (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S223_20">2 Samuel 23:20</span>). It was “carried to Tyre, Sidon, and Damascus as a luxury, and labourers sweltering in the hot harvest-fields used it for the purpose of cooling the water which they drank (<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR25_13">Proverbs 25:13</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR18_14">Jeremiah 18:14</span>). No doubt Herod Antipas, at his feasts in Tiberias, enjoyed also from this very source the modern luxury of ice-water.”
