Christian congregations were here formed at an early time (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P11_1">1 Peter 1:1</span>). Paul was prevented by the Spirit from entering this province(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_7">Acts 16:7</span>). It is noted in church history as the province ruled over by Pliny as Roman proconsul, who was perplexed as to the course he should take with the numerous Christians brought before his tribunal on account of their profession of Christianity and their conduct, and wrote to Trajan, the emperor, for instructions (A.D. 107).<br>
