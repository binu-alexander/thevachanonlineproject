It was bounded on the east by the greater Phrygia, and on the west by Ionia and the AEgean Sea.<br>(2.) A woman of Thyatira, a “seller of purple,” who dwelt in Philippi(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_14,15">Acts 16:14, 15</span>). She was not a Jewess but a proselyte. The Lord opened her heart as she heard the gospel from the lips of Paul (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_13">16:13</span>). She thus became the first in Europe who embraced Christianity. She was a person apparently of considerable wealth, for she could afford to give a home to Paul and his companions. (See THYATIRA.)
