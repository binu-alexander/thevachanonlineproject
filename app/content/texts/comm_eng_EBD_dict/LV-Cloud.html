</div></div><div class="section commentary english_dict eng" dir="ltr" lang="en" data-id="Cloud" ><div class="is"><b>CLOUD</b></div><br>"CLOUD" The Hebrew so rendered means “a covering,” because clouds cover the sky. The word is used as a symbol of the Divine presence, as indicating the splendour of that glory which it conceals (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX16_10">Exodus 16:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX33_9">33:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU11_25">Numbers 11:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU12_5">12:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB22_14">Job 22:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_11">Psalm 18:11</span>). A “cloud without rain” is a proverbial saying, denoting a man who does not keep his promise(<span class="bibleref" data-id="PR16_15">Proverbs 16:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS18_4">Isaiah 18:4</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS25_5">25:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JD1_12">Jude 1:12</span>). A cloud is the figure of that which is transitory (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB30_15">Job 30:15</span>; Hos. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB6_4">6:4</span>). A bright cloud is the symbolical seat of the Divine presence (Ex.<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB29_42,43">29:42, 43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_10">1 Kings 8:10</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R25_14">2 Chronicles 5:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK43_4">Ezekiel 43:4</span>), and was called the Shechinah (q.v.). Jehovah came down upon Sinai in a cloud (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX19_9">Exodus 19:9</span>); and the cloud filled the court around the tabernacle in the wilderness so that Moses could not enter it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_34,35">Exodus 40:34, 35</span>). At the dedication of the temple also the cloud “filled the house of the Lord” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_10"><span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_10">1 Kings 8:10</span></span>). Thus in like manner when Christ comes the second time he is described as coming “in the clouds” (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT17_5">Matthew 17:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT24_30">24:30</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC1_9,11">Acts 1:9, 11</span>). False teachers are likened unto clouds carried about with a tempest (<span class="bibleref" data-id="P22_17">2 Peter 2:17</span>). The infirmities of old age, which come one after another, are compared by Solomon to “clouds returning after the rain”(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EC12_2">Ecclesiastes 12:2</span>). The blotting out of sins is like the sudden disappearance of threatening clouds from the sky (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS44_22">Isaiah 44:22</span>).<br>Cloud, the pillar of, was the glory-cloud which indicated God’s presence leading the ransomed people through the wilderness (<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_22">Exodus 13:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX33_9,10">33:9, 10</span>). This pillar preceded the people as they marched, resting on the ark(<span class="bibleref" data-id="EX13_21">Exodus 13:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX40_36">40:36</span>). By night it became a pillar of fire (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NU9_17-23">Numbers 9:17-23</span>).<br>
