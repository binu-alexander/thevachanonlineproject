The fishing-net was probably constructed after the form of that used by the Egyptians (<span class="bibleref" data-id="IS19_8">Isaiah 19:8</span>). There were three kinds of nets. (1.) The drag-net or hauling-net (Gr. sagene), of great size, and requiring many men to work it. It was usually let down from the fishing-boat, and then drawn to the shore or into the boat, as circumstances might require (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_47,48">Matthew 13:47, 48</span>). (2.) The hand-net or casting-net (Gr. amphiblestron), which was thrown from a rock or a boat at any fish that might be seen (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT4_18">Matthew 4:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK1_16">Mark 1:16</span>). It was called by the Latins funda. It was of circular form, “like the top of a tent.” (3.) The bag-net (Gr. diktyon), used for enclosing fish in deep water (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK5_4-9">Luke 5:4-9</span>).<br>The fowling-nets were (1) the trap, consisting of a net spread over a frame, and supported by a stick in such a way that it fell with the slightest touch(<span class="bibleref" data-id="AM3_5">Amos 3:5</span>, “gin;” <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS69_22">Psalm 69:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JB18_9">Job 18:9</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EC9_12">Ecclesiastes 9:12</span>). (2) The snare, consisting of a cord to catch birds by the leg (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JB18_10">Job 18:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS18_5">Psalm 18:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS116_3">116:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS140_5">140:5</span>). (3.) The decoy, a cage filled with birds as decoys (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR5_26,27">Jeremiah 5:26, 27</span>). Hunting-nets were much in use among the Hebrews.<br>
