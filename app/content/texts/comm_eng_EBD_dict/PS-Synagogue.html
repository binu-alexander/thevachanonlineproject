The exiles gathered together for the reading of the law and the prophets as they had opportunity, and after their return synagogues were established all over the land (<span class="bibleref" data-id="ER8_15">Ezra 8:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_2">Nehemiah 8:2</span>). In after years, when the Jews were dispersed abroad, wherever they went they erected synagogues and kept up the stated services of worship (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_20">Acts 9:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_5">13:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_1">17:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_17">17:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_4">18:4</span>). The form and internal arrangements of the synagogue would greatly depend on the wealth of the Jews who erected it, and on the place where it was built. “Yet there are certain traditional pecularities which have doubtless united together by a common resemblance the Jewish synagogues of all ages and countries. The arrangements for the women’s place in a separate gallery or behind a partition of lattice-work; the desk in the centre, where the reader, like Ezra in ancient days, from his‘pulpit of wood,’ may ‘open the book in the sight of all of people and read in the book of the law of God distinctly, and give the sense, and cause them to understand the reading’ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_4,8">Nehemiah 8:4, 8</span>); the carefully closed ark on the side of the building nearest to Jerusalem, for the preservation of the rolls or manuscripts of the law; the seats all round the building, whence‘the eyes of all them that are in the synagogue’ may ‘be fastened’ on him who speaks (<span class="bibleref" data-id="LK4_20">Luke 4:20</span>); the ‘chief seats’ (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT23_6">Matthew 23:6</span>) which were appropriated to the ‘ruler’ or ‘rulers’ of the synagogue, according as its organization may have been more or less complete;”, these were features common to all the synagogues.<br>Where perfected into a system, the services of the synagogue, which were at the same hours as those of the temple, consisted, (1) of prayer, which formed a kind of liturgy, there were in all eighteen prayers; (2) the reading of the Scriptures in certain definite portions; and (3) the exposition of the portions read. (See <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK4_15,22">Luke 4:15, 22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_14">Acts 13:14</span>.) The synagogue was also sometimes used as a court of judicature, in which the rulers presided (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT10_17">Matthew 10:17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK5_22">Mark 5:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK12_11">Luke 12:11</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK21_12">21:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_15">Acts 13:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC22_19">22:19</span>); also as public schools.<br>The establishment of synagogues wherever the Jews were found in sufficient numbers helped greatly to keep alive Israel’s hope of the coming of the Messiah, and to prepare the way for the spread of the gospel in other lands. The worship of the Christian Church was afterwards modelled after that of the synagogue.<br>Christ and his disciples frequently taught in the synagogues (<span class="bibleref" data-id="MT13_54">Matthew 13:54</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MK6_2">Mark 6:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN18_20">John 18:20</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC13_5,15,44">Acts 13:5, 15, 44</span>; 14:1; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC17_2-4,10,17">17:2-4, 10, 17</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC18_4,26">18:4, 26</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC19_8">19:8</span>).<br>To be “put out of the synagogue,” a phrase used by John (<span class="bibleref" data-id="AC9_22">9:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC12_42">12:42</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC16_2">16:2</span>), means to be excommunicated.<br>
