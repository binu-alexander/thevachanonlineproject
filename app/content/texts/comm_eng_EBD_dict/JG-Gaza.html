It is one of the oldest cities of the world(<span class="bibleref" data-id="GN10_19">Genesis 10:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47">Joshua 15:47</span></span>). Its earliest inhabitants were the Avims, who were conquered and displaced by the Caphtorims (<span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_23"><span class="bibleref" data-id="DT2_23">Deuteronomy 2:23</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS13_2,3">Joshua 13:2, 3</span>), a Philistine tribe. In the division of the land it fell to the lot of Judah (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JS15_47">Joshua 15:47</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG1_18">Judges 1:18</span>). It was the southernmost of the five great Philistine cities which gave each a golden emerod as a trespass-offering unto the Lord (<span class="bibleref" data-id="S16_17">1 Samuel 6:17</span>). Its gates were carried away by Samson (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_1-3">Judges 16:1-3</span>). Here he was afterwards a prisoner, and“did grind in the prison house.” Here he also pulled down the temple of Dagon, and slew “all the lords of the Philistines,” himself also perishing in the ruin (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JG16_21-30">Judges 16:21-30</span>). The prophets denounce the judgments of God against it (<span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_20"><span class="bibleref" data-id="JR25_20">Jeremiah 25:20</span></span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR47_5">47:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="AM1_6,7">Amos 1:6, 7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZP2_4">Zephaniah 2:4</span>). It is referred to in <span class="bibleref" data-id="AC8_26">Acts 8:26</span>. Philip is here told to take the road from Jerusalem to Gaza(about 6 miles south-west of Jerusalem), “which is desert”, i.e., the “desert road,” probably by Hebron, through the desert hills of Southern Judea.<br>(See SAMSON.) It is noticed on monuments as early as B.C. 1600. Its small port is now called el-Mineh.<br>
