<div class='s'>By Faith, or by Works of the Law? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_1' data-id='GL3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. </span>
<span class='v GL3_2' data-id='GL3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? </span>
<span class='v GL3_3' data-id='GL3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? </span>
<span class='v GL3_4' data-id='GL3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Did you suffer so many things in vain—if indeed it was in vain? </span>
<span class='v GL3_5' data-id='GL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith— </span>
<span class='v GL3_6' data-id='GL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>just as Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_7' data-id='GL3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GL3_8' data-id='GL3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” </span>
<span class='v GL3_9' data-id='GL3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Righteous Shall Live by Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_10' data-id='GL3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them.” </span>
<span class='v GL3_11' data-id='GL3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “The righteous shall live by faith.” </span>
<span class='v GL3_12' data-id='GL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the law is not of faith, rather “The one who does them shall live by them.” </span>
<span class='v GL3_13' data-id='GL3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree”— </span>
<span class='v GL3_14' data-id='GL3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Law and the Promise </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_15' data-id='GL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified. </span>
<span class='v GL3_16' data-id='GL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, “And to offsprings,” referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring,” who is Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_17' data-id='GL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void. </span>
<span class='v GL3_18' data-id='GL3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_19' data-id='GL3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary. </span>
<span class='v GL3_20' data-id='GL3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_21' data-id='GL3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law. </span>
<span class='v GL3_22' data-id='GL3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_23' data-id='GL3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed. </span>
<span class='v GL3_24' data-id='GL3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. </span>
<span class='v GL3_25' data-id='GL3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian, </span>
<span class='v GL3_26' data-id='GL3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith. </span>
<span class='v GL3_27' data-id='GL3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_28' data-id='GL3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v GL3_29' data-id='GL3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise. </span></div></div>
