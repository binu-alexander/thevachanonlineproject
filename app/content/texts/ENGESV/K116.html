<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_1' data-id='K116_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, </span>
<span class='v K116_2' data-id='K116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins, </span>
<span class='v K116_3' data-id='K116_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. </span>
<span class='v K116_4' data-id='K116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_5' data-id='K116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K116_6' data-id='K116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place. </span>
<span class='v K116_7' data-id='K116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Moreover, the word of the LORD came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Elah Reigns in Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_8' data-id='K116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years. </span>
<span class='v K116_9' data-id='K116_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah, </span>
<span class='v K116_10' data-id='K116_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_11' data-id='K116_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends. </span>
<span class='v K116_12' data-id='K116_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, </span>
<span class='v K116_13' data-id='K116_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their idols. </span>
<span class='v K116_14' data-id='K116_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </span></div>

<span class='v K116_15' data-id='K116_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, </span>
<span class='v K116_16' data-id='K116_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and the troops who were encamped heard it said, “Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king.” Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. </span>
<span class='v K116_17' data-id='K116_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. </span>
<span class='v K116_18' data-id='K116_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king's house and burned the king's house over him with fire and died, </span>
<span class='v K116_19' data-id='K116_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>because of his sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the LORD, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin. </span>
<span class='v K116_20' data-id='K116_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_21' data-id='K116_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. </span>
<span class='v K116_22' data-id='K116_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king. </span>
<span class='v K116_23' data-id='K116_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah. </span>
<span class='v K116_24' data-id='K116_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_25' data-id='K116_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Omri did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did more evil than all who were before him. </span>
<span class='v K116_26' data-id='K116_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, provoking the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols. </span>
<span class='v K116_27' data-id='K116_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K116_28' data-id='K116_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Ahab Reigns in Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K116_29' data-id='K116_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. </span>
<span class='v K116_30' data-id='K116_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD, more than all who were before him. </span>
<span class='v K116_31' data-id='K116_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him. </span>
<span class='v K116_32' data-id='K116_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. </span>
<span class='v K116_33' data-id='K116_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. </span>
<span class='v K116_34' data-id='K116_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho.
