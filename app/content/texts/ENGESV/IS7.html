<div class='s'>Isaiah Sent to King Ahaz </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_1' data-id='IS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it. </span>
<span class='v IS7_2' data-id='IS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the house of David was told, “Syria is in league with Ephraim,” the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_3' data-id='IS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to Isaiah, “Go out to meet Ahaz, you and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer's Field. </span>
<span class='v IS7_4' data-id='IS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And say to him, ‘Be careful, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remaliah. </span>
<span class='v IS7_5' data-id='IS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Because Syria, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has devised evil against you, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS7_6' data-id='IS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,” </span>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>thus says the Lord GOD: </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'>“ ‘It shall not stand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'>and it shall not come to pass. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'>and the head of Damascus is Rezin. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'>(Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.) </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“ ‘And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>If you are not firm in faith, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>you will not be firm at all.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Sign of Immanuel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_10' data-id='IS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz, </span>
<span class='v IS7_11' data-id='IS7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” </span>
<span class='v IS7_12' data-id='IS7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” </span>
<span class='v IS7_13' data-id='IS7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? </span>
<span class='v IS7_14' data-id='IS7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. </span>
<span class='v IS7_15' data-id='IS7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. </span>
<span class='v IS7_16' data-id='IS7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. </span>
<span class='v IS7_17' data-id='IS7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_18' data-id='IS7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly that is at the end of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. </span>
<span class='v IS7_19' data-id='IS7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_20' data-id='IS7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired beyond the River—with the king of Assyria—the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_21' data-id='IS7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep, </span>
<span class='v IS7_22' data-id='IS7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will eat curds, for everyone who is left in the land will eat curds and honey. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_23' data-id='IS7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns. </span>
<span class='v IS7_24' data-id='IS7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>With bow and arrows a man will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns. </span>
<span class='v IS7_25' data-id='IS7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And as for all the hills that used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread. </span></div></div>
