<div class='s'>Food Offered to Idols </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_1' data-id='C18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that “all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” puffs up, but love builds up. </span>
<span class='v C18_2' data-id='C18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know. </span>
<span class='v C18_3' data-id='C18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_4' data-id='C18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.” </span>
<span class='v C18_5' data-id='C18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”— </span>
<span class='v C18_6' data-id='C18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_7' data-id='C18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. </span>
<span class='v C18_8' data-id='C18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do. </span>
<span class='v C18_9' data-id='C18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak. </span>
<span class='v C18_10' data-id='C18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols? </span>
<span class='v C18_11' data-id='C18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died. </span>
<span class='v C18_12' data-id='C18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. </span>
<span class='v C18_13' data-id='C18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble. </span></div></div>
