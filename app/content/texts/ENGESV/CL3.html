<span class='v CL3_2' data-id='CL3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth. </span>
<span class='v CL3_3' data-id='CL3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. </span>

<span class='v CL3_5' data-id='CL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. </span>
<span class='v CL3_6' data-id='CL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On account of these the wrath of God is coming. </span>
<span class='v CL3_7' data-id='CL3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In these you too once walked, when you were living in them. </span>

<span class='v CL3_15' data-id='CL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful. </span>
<span class='v CL3_16' data-id='CL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. </span>
<span class='v CL3_17' data-id='CL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. </span></div>
