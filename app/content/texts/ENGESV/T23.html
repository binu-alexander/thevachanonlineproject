<span class='v T23_1' data-id='T23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty. </span>
<span class='v T23_2' data-id='T23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, </span>
<span class='v T23_3' data-id='T23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good, </span>
<span class='v T23_4' data-id='T23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, </span>
<span class='v T23_5' data-id='T23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people. </span>
<span class='v T23_6' data-id='T23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, </span>
<span class='v T23_7' data-id='T23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T23_8' data-id='T23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith. </span>
<span class='v T23_9' data-id='T23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men. </span></div>

<span class='v T23_11' data-id='T23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me. </span>
<span class='v T23_12' data-id='T23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, </span>
<span class='v T23_13' data-id='T23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. </span>
<span class='v T23_14' data-id='T23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it </span>
<span class='v T23_15' data-id='T23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T23_16' data-id='T23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righ teousness, </span>
