<div class='s'>Instructions for the Church </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T15_1' data-id='T15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father. Treat younger men like brothers, </span>
<span class='v T15_2' data-id='T15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in all purity. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T15_3' data-id='T15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Honor widows who are truly widows. </span>
<span class='v T15_4' data-id='T15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God. </span>
<span class='v T15_5' data-id='T15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day, </span>
<span class='v T15_6' data-id='T15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives. </span>
<span class='v T15_7' data-id='T15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach. </span>
<span class='v T15_8' data-id='T15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T15_9' data-id='T15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband, </span>
<span class='v T15_10' data-id='T15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has shown hospitality, has washed the feet of the saints, has cared for the afflicted, and has devoted herself to every good work. </span>
<span class='v T15_11' data-id='T15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry </span>
<span class='v T15_12' data-id='T15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith. </span>
<span class='v T15_13' data-id='T15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not. </span>
<span class='v T15_14' data-id='T15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander. </span>
<span class='v T15_15' data-id='T15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For some have already strayed after Satan. </span>
<span class='v T15_16' data-id='T15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are really widows. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T15_17' data-id='T15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. </span>
<span class='v T15_18' data-id='T15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.” </span>
<span class='v T15_19' data-id='T15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. </span>
<span class='v T15_20' data-id='T15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear. </span>
<span class='v T15_21' data-id='T15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality. </span>
<span class='v T15_22' data-id='T15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure. </span>
<span class='v T15_23' data-id='T15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.) </span>
<span class='v T15_24' data-id='T15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The sins of some men are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later. </span>
<span class='v T15_25' data-id='T15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden. </span></div></div>
