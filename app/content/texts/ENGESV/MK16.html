<span class='v MK16_2' data-id='MK16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MK16_3' data-id='MK16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” </span>
<span class='v MK16_4' data-id='MK16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back—it was very large. </span>
<span class='v MK16_5' data-id='MK16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. </span>
<span class='v MK16_6' data-id='MK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. </span>
<span class='v MK16_7' data-id='MK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.” </span>
<span class='v MK16_8' data-id='MK16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. </span></div>

<span class='v MK16_15' data-id='MK16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. </span>
