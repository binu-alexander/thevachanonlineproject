<div class='s'>The Coming Assyrian Invasion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS8_1' data-id='IS8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Take a large tablet and write on it in common characters, ‘Belonging to Maher-shalal-hash-baz.’ </span>
<span class='v IS8_2' data-id='IS8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I will get reliable witnesses, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah, to attest for me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS8_3' data-id='IS8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, “Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz; </span>
<span class='v IS8_4' data-id='IS8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for before the boy knows how to cry ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away before the king of Assyria.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS8_5' data-id='IS8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The LORD spoke to me again: </span>
<span class='v IS8_6' data-id='IS8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, </span>
<span class='v IS8_7' data-id='IS8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks, </span>
<span class='v IS8_8' data-id='IS8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck, and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>

<span class='v IS8_9' data-id='IS8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be broken, you peoples, and be shattered; </span></div>

<span class='v IS8_9' data-id='IS8_9'>give ear, all you far countries; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS8_9' data-id='IS8_9'>strap on your armor and be shattered; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS8_9' data-id='IS8_9'>strap on your armor and be shattered. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS8_10' data-id='IS8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Take counsel together, but it will come to nothing; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS8_11' data-id='IS8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying: </span>
<span class='v IS8_12' data-id='IS8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. </span>
<span class='v IS8_13' data-id='IS8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy. Let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. </span>
<span class='v IS8_14' data-id='IS8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v IS8_15' data-id='IS8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS8_16' data-id='IS8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Bind up the testimony; seal the teaching among my disciples. </span>
<span class='v IS8_17' data-id='IS8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him. </span>
<span class='v IS8_18' data-id='IS8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion. </span>
<span class='v IS8_19' data-id='IS8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And when they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the necromancers who chirp and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Should they inquire of the dead on behalf of the living? </span>
<span class='v IS8_20' data-id='IS8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>To the teaching and to the testimony! If they will not speak according to this word, it is because they have no dawn. </span>
<span class='v IS8_21' data-id='IS8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry. And when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will speak contemptuously against their king and their God, and turn their faces upward. </span>
<span class='v IS8_22' data-id='IS8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish. And they will be thrust into thick darkness. </span></div></div>
