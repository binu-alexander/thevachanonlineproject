<span class='v EK2_1' data-id='EK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.” </span>
<span class='v EK2_2' data-id='EK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And as he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. </span>
<span class='v EK2_3' data-id='EK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day. </span>
<span class='v EK2_4' data-id='EK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The descendants also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD.’ </span>
<span class='v EK2_5' data-id='EK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that a prophet has been among them. </span>
<span class='v EK2_6' data-id='EK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions.

<span class='v EK2_7' data-id='EK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house. </span></div>
