<span class='v JS1_5' data-id='JS1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you. </span>
<span class='v JS1_6' data-id='JS1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. </span>
<span class='v JS1_7' data-id='JS1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you.

<span class='v JS1_8' data-id='JS1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.

<span class='v JS1_9' data-id='JS1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.” </span></div>

<span class='v JS1_10' data-id='JS1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, </span>
