<div class='s'>Christ's Example of Humility </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_1' data-id='PP2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, </span>
<span class='v PP2_2' data-id='PP2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. </span>
<span class='v PP2_3' data-id='PP2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. </span>
<span class='v PP2_4' data-id='PP2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. </span>
<span class='v PP2_5' data-id='PP2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v PP2_6' data-id='PP2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, </span>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. </span>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. </span>
<span class='v PP2_9' data-id='PP2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, </span>
<span class='v PP2_10' data-id='PP2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, </span>
<span class='v PP2_11' data-id='PP2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Lights in the World </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_12' data-id='PP2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, </span>
<span class='v PP2_13' data-id='PP2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_14' data-id='PP2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do all things without grumbling or questioning, </span>
<span class='v PP2_15' data-id='PP2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, </span>
<span class='v PP2_16' data-id='PP2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. </span>
<span class='v PP2_17' data-id='PP2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. </span>
<span class='v PP2_18' data-id='PP2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Timothy and Epaphroditus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_19' data-id='PP2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_20' data-id='PP2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. </span>
<span class='v PP2_21' data-id='PP2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP2_22' data-id='PP2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP2_23' data-id='PP2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, </span>
<span class='v PP2_24' data-id='PP2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_25' data-id='PP2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, </span>
<span class='v PP2_26' data-id='PP2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. </span>
<span class='v PP2_27' data-id='PP2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. </span>
<span class='v PP2_28' data-id='PP2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. </span>
<span class='v PP2_29' data-id='PP2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, </span>
<span class='v PP2_30' data-id='PP2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me. </span></div></div>
