<div class='s'>A Living Stone and a Holy People </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_1' data-id='P12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. </span>
<span class='v P12_2' data-id='P12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up to salvation— </span>
<span class='v P12_3' data-id='P12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_4' data-id='P12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious, </span>
<span class='v P12_5' data-id='P12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v P12_6' data-id='P12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For it stands in Scripture: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P12_6' data-id='P12_6'>“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P12_6' data-id='P12_6'>a cornerstone chosen and precious, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P12_6' data-id='P12_6'>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v P12_7' data-id='P12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P12_7' data-id='P12_7'>“The stone that the builders rejected </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P12_7' data-id='P12_7'>has become the cornerstone,” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v P12_8' data-id='P12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P12_8' data-id='P12_8'>“A stone of stumbling, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P12_8' data-id='P12_8'>and a rock of offense.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v P12_8' data-id='P12_8'>They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_9' data-id='P12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. </span>
<span class='v P12_10' data-id='P12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_11' data-id='P12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. </span>
<span class='v P12_12' data-id='P12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evil doers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Submission to Authority </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_13' data-id='P12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, </span>
<span class='v P12_14' data-id='P12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good. </span>
<span class='v P12_15' data-id='P12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people. </span>
<span class='v P12_16' data-id='P12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God. </span>
<span class='v P12_17' data-id='P12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P12_18' data-id='P12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust. </span>
<span class='v P12_19' data-id='P12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly. </span>
<span class='v P12_20' data-id='P12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God. </span>
<span class='v P12_21' data-id='P12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. </span>
<span class='v P12_22' data-id='P12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. </span>
<span class='v P12_23' data-id='P12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly. </span>
<span class='v P12_24' data-id='P12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. </span>
<span class='v P12_25' data-id='P12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls. </span></div></div>
