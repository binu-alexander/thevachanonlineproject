<div class='s'>The Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_1' data-id='LK24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. </span>
<span class='v LK24_2' data-id='LK24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, </span>
<span class='v LK24_3' data-id='LK24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK24_4' data-id='LK24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. </span>
<span class='v LK24_5' data-id='LK24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? </span>
<span class='v LK24_6' data-id='LK24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, </span>
<span class='v LK24_7' data-id='LK24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_8' data-id='LK24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And they remembered his words, </span>
<span class='v LK24_9' data-id='LK24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. </span>
<span class='v LK24_10' data-id='LK24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, </span>
<span class='v LK24_11' data-id='LK24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_12' data-id='LK24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened. </span></div>
<div class='s'>On the Road to Emmaus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_13' data-id='LK24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v LK24_14' data-id='LK24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. </span>
<span class='v LK24_15' data-id='LK24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_16' data-id='LK24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. </span>
<span class='v LK24_17' data-id='LK24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. </span>
<span class='v LK24_18' data-id='LK24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” </span>
<span class='v LK24_19' data-id='LK24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, </span>
<span class='v LK24_20' data-id='LK24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. </span>
<span class='v LK24_21' data-id='LK24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. </span>
<span class='v LK24_22' data-id='LK24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, </span>
<span class='v LK24_23' data-id='LK24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. </span>
<span class='v LK24_24' data-id='LK24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_25' data-id='LK24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! </span>
<span class='v LK24_26' data-id='LK24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” </span>
<span class='v LK24_27' data-id='LK24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_28' data-id='LK24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, </span>
<span class='v LK24_29' data-id='LK24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_30' data-id='LK24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_31' data-id='LK24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. </span>
<span class='v LK24_32' data-id='LK24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” </span>
<span class='v LK24_33' data-id='LK24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, </span>
<span class='v LK24_34' data-id='LK24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” </span>
<span class='v LK24_35' data-id='LK24_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to His Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_36' data-id='LK24_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>As they were talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, “Peace to you!” </span>
<span class='v LK24_37' data-id='LK24_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But they were startled and frightened and thought they saw a spirit. </span>
<span class='v LK24_38' data-id='LK24_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? </span>
<span class='v LK24_39' data-id='LK24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_40' data-id='LK24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. </span>
<span class='v LK24_41' data-id='LK24_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And while they still disbelieved for joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?” </span>
<span class='v LK24_42' data-id='LK24_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, </span>
<span class='v LK24_43' data-id='LK24_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and he took it and ate before them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_44' data-id='LK24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_45' data-id='LK24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures, </span>
<span class='v LK24_46' data-id='LK24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead, </span>
<span class='v LK24_47' data-id='LK24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK24_48' data-id='LK24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>You are witnesses of these things. </span>
<span class='v LK24_49' data-id='LK24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And behold, I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ascension </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_50' data-id='LK24_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_51' data-id='LK24_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>While he blessed them, he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. </span>
<span class='v LK24_52' data-id='LK24_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, </span>
<span class='v LK24_53' data-id='LK24_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>and were continually in the temple blessing God. </span></div></div>
