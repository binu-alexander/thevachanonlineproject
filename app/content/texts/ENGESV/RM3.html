<div class='s'>God's Righteousness Upheld </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_1' data-id='RM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM3_2' data-id='RM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. </span>
<span class='v RM3_3' data-id='RM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? </span>
<span class='v RM3_4' data-id='RM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_4' data-id='RM3_4'>“That you may be justified in your words, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_4' data-id='RM3_4'>and prevail when you are judged.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM3_5' data-id='RM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.) </span>
<span class='v RM3_6' data-id='RM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>By no means! For then how could God judge the world? </span>
<span class='v RM3_7' data-id='RM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? </span>
<span class='v RM3_8' data-id='RM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And why not do evil that good may come?—as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just. </span></div>
<div class='s'>No One Is Righteous </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_9' data-id='RM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin, </span>
<span class='v RM3_10' data-id='RM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>as it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_10' data-id='RM3_10'>“None is righteous, no, not one; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_11' data-id='RM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>no one understands; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_11' data-id='RM3_11'>no one seeks for God. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'>no one does good, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'>not even one.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> “Their throat is an open grave; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'>they use their tongues to deceive.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'>“The venom of asps is under their lips.” </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_14' data-id='RM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> “Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_15' data-id='RM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> “Their feet are swift to shed blood; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_16' data-id='RM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>in their paths are ruin and misery, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_17' data-id='RM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and the way of peace they have not known.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_18' data-id='RM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> “There is no fear of God before their eyes.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_19' data-id='RM3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God. </span>
<span class='v RM3_20' data-id='RM3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Righteousness of God Through Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_21' data-id='RM3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— </span>
<span class='v RM3_22' data-id='RM3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: </span>
<span class='v RM3_23' data-id='RM3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, </span>
<span class='v RM3_24' data-id='RM3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v RM3_25' data-id='RM3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. </span>
<span class='v RM3_26' data-id='RM3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_27' data-id='RM3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. </span>
<span class='v RM3_28' data-id='RM3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law. </span>
<span class='v RM3_29' data-id='RM3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also, </span>
<span class='v RM3_30' data-id='RM3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>since God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. </span>
<span class='v RM3_31' data-id='RM3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law. </span></div></div>
