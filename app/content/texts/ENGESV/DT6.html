<span class='v DT6_2' data-id='DT6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that you may fear the LORD your God, you and your son and your son's son, by keeping all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, all the days of your life, and that your days may be long. </span>
<span class='v DT6_3' data-id='DT6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Hear therefore, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you, and that you may multiply greatly, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT6_4' data-id='DT6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. </span>
<span class='v DT6_5' data-id='DT6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. </span>
<span class='v DT6_6' data-id='DT6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. </span>
<span class='v DT6_7' data-id='DT6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. </span>
<span class='v DT6_8' data-id='DT6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. </span>
<span class='v DT6_9' data-id='DT6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. </span></div>

<span class='v DT6_11' data-id='DT6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and houses full of all good things that you did not fill, and cisterns that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant—and when you eat and are full, </span>
<span class='v DT6_12' data-id='DT6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>then take care lest you forget the LORD, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. </span>
<span class='v DT6_13' data-id='DT6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>It is the LORD your God you shall fear. Him you shall serve and by his name you shall swear. </span>

<span class='v DT6_15' data-id='DT6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>for the LORD your God in your midst is a jealous God, lest the anger of the LORD your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. </span></div>

<span class='v DT6_21' data-id='DT6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>then you shall say to your son, ‘We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt. And the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. </span>
<span class='v DT6_22' data-id='DT6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and grievous, against Egypt and against Pharaoh and all his household, before our eyes. </span>
