<span class='v AM7_1' data-id='AM7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king's mowings. </span>
<span class='v AM7_2' data-id='AM7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When they had finished eating the grass of the land, I said, </span></div>

<span class='v AM7_2' data-id='AM7_2'>“O Lord GOD, please forgive! </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_2' data-id='AM7_2'>He is so small!” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_3' data-id='AM7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The LORD relented concerning this; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_3' data-id='AM7_3'>“It shall not be,” said the LORD. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_4' data-id='AM7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord GOD showed me: behold, the Lord GOD was calling for a judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep and was eating up the land. </span>
<span class='v AM7_5' data-id='AM7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I said, </span></div>

<span class='v AM7_6' data-id='AM7_6'>“This also shall not be,” said the Lord GOD. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_7' data-id='AM7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is what he showed me: behold, the Lord was standing beside a wall built with a plumb line, with a plumb line in his hand. </span>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to me, “Amos, what do you see?” And I said, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, </span></div>

<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'>“Behold, I am setting a plumb line </span></div>

<div class='s'>Amos Accused </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_10' data-id='AM7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel. The land is not able to bear all his words. </span>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For thus Amos has said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'>“ ‘Jeroboam shall die by the sword, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'>away from his land.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AM7_12' data-id='AM7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Amaziah said to Amos, “O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there, </span>
<span class='v AM7_13' data-id='AM7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>but never again prophesy at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the kingdom.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_14' data-id='AM7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, “I was no prophet, nor a prophet's son, but I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs. </span>
<span class='v AM7_15' data-id='AM7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the LORD took me from following the flock, and the LORD said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ </span>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore hear the word of the LORD. </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'>“You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_17' data-id='AM7_17'>“ ‘Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, </span></div>
