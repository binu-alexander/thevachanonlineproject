<span class='v RV22_2' data-id='RV22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations. </span>
<span class='v RV22_3' data-id='RV22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him. </span>
