<div class='c'>5</div>
<div class='s'>Christ Has Set Us Free </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_1' data-id='GL5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_2' data-id='GL5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. </span>
<span class='v GL5_3' data-id='GL5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_4' data-id='GL5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. </span>
<span class='v GL5_5' data-id='GL5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v GL5_6' data-id='GL5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_7' data-id='GL5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth? </span>
<span class='v GL5_8' data-id='GL5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This persuasion is not from him who calls you. </span>
<span class='v GL5_9' data-id='GL5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. </span>
<span class='v GL5_10' data-id='GL5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. </span>
<span class='v GL5_11' data-id='GL5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. </span>
<span class='v GL5_12' data-id='GL5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_13' data-id='GL5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </span>
<span class='v GL5_14' data-id='GL5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” </span>
<span class='v GL5_15' data-id='GL5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Walk by the Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_16' data-id='GL5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. </span>
<span class='v GL5_17' data-id='GL5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. </span>
<span class='v GL5_18' data-id='GL5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_19' data-id='GL5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, </span>
<span class='v GL5_20' data-id='GL5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, </span>
<span class='v GL5_21' data-id='GL5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v GL5_22' data-id='GL5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span>
<span class='v GL5_23' data-id='GL5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_24' data-id='GL5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_25' data-id='GL5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v GL5_26' data-id='GL5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. </span></div></div>
