<span class='v CL1_4' data-id='CL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints, </span>
<span class='v CL1_5' data-id='CL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel, </span>
<span class='v CL1_6' data-id='CL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing—as it also does among you, since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth, </span>
<span class='v CL1_7' data-id='CL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf </span>

<span class='v CL1_16' data-id='CL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. </span>
<span class='v CL1_17' data-id='CL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together. </span>
<span class='v CL1_18' data-id='CL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent. </span>
<span class='v CL1_19' data-id='CL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, </span>
<span class='v CL1_20' data-id='CL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL1_21' data-id='CL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds, </span>
<span class='v CL1_22' data-id='CL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him, </span>
<span class='v CL1_23' data-id='CL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister. </span></div>

<span class='v CL1_24' data-id='CL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church, </span>
<span class='v CL1_25' data-id='CL1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, </span>
