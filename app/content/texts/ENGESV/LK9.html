<div class='s'>Jesus Sends Out the Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_1' data-id='LK9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, </span>
<span class='v LK9_2' data-id='LK9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. </span>
<span class='v LK9_3' data-id='LK9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics. </span>
<span class='v LK9_4' data-id='LK9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart. </span>
<span class='v LK9_5' data-id='LK9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And wherever they do not receive you, when you leave that town shake off the dust from your feet as a testimony against them.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_6' data-id='LK9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Herod Is Perplexed by Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_7' data-id='LK9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead, </span>
<span class='v LK9_8' data-id='LK9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>by some that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the prophets of old had risen. </span>
<span class='v LK9_9' data-id='LK9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_10' data-id='LK9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On their return the apostles told him all that they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida. </span>
<span class='v LK9_11' data-id='LK9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When the crowds learned it, they followed him, and he welcomed them and spoke to them of the kingdom of God and cured those who had need of healing. </span>
<span class='v LK9_12' data-id='LK9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now the day began to wear away, and the twelve came and said to him, “Send the crowd away to go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and get provisions, for we are here in a desolate place.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_13' data-id='LK9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish—unless we are to go and buy food for all these people.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_14' data-id='LK9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_15' data-id='LK9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they did so, and had them all sit down. </span>
<span class='v LK9_16' data-id='LK9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing over them. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. </span>
<span class='v LK9_17' data-id='LK9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they all ate and were satisfied. And what was left over was picked up, twelve baskets of broken pieces. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Confesses Jesus As the Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_18' data-id='LK9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> Now it happened that as he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” </span>
<span class='v LK9_19' data-id='LK9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And they answered, “John the Baptist. But others say, Elijah, and others, that one of the prophets of old has risen.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_20' data-id='LK9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered, “The Christ of God.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Foretells His Death </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_21' data-id='LK9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he strictly charged and commanded them to tell this to no one, </span>
<span class='v LK9_22' data-id='LK9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Take Up Your Cross and Follow Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_23' data-id='LK9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. </span>
<span class='v LK9_24' data-id='LK9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. </span>
<span class='v LK9_25' data-id='LK9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself? </span>
<span class='v LK9_26' data-id='LK9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. </span>
<span class='v LK9_27' data-id='LK9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Transfiguration </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_28' data-id='LK9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now about eight days after these sayings he took with him Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray. </span>
<span class='v LK9_29' data-id='LK9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became dazzling white. </span>
<span class='v LK9_30' data-id='LK9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And behold, two men were talking with him, Moses and Elijah, </span>
<span class='v LK9_31' data-id='LK9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_32' data-id='LK9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_33' data-id='LK9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And as the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. </span>
<span class='v LK9_34' data-id='LK9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>As he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. </span>
<span class='v LK9_35' data-id='LK9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to him!” </span>
<span class='v LK9_36' data-id='LK9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And when the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Healing of a Boy with an Unclean Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_37' data-id='LK9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_38' data-id='LK9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. </span>
<span class='v LK9_39' data-id='LK9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out. It convulses him so that he foams at the mouth; and shatters him, and will hardly leave him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_40' data-id='LK9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_41' data-id='LK9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_42' data-id='LK9_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>While he was coming, the demon threw him to the ground and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. </span>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And all were astonished at the majesty of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'>Jesus Again Foretells His Death </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'>But while they were all marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v LK9_44' data-id='LK9_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>“Let these words sink into your ears: The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_45' data-id='LK9_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them, so that they might not perceive it. And they were afraid to ask him about this saying. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Who Is the Greatest? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_46' data-id='LK9_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>An argument arose among them as to which of them was the greatest. </span>
<span class='v LK9_47' data-id='LK9_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, knowing the reasoning of their hearts, took a child and put him by his side </span>
<span class='v LK9_48' data-id='LK9_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “Whoever receives this child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Anyone Not Against Us Is For Us </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_49' data-id='LK9_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he does not follow with us.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_50' data-id='LK9_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for the one who is not against you is for you.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Samaritan Village Rejects Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_51' data-id='LK9_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>When the days drew near for him to be taken up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_52' data-id='LK9_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make preparations for him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_53' data-id='LK9_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>But the people did not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_54' data-id='LK9_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” </span>
<span class='v LK9_55' data-id='LK9_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>But he turned and rebuked them. </span>
<span class='v LK9_56' data-id='LK9_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And they went on to another village. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Cost of Following Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_57' data-id='LK9_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span> As they were going along the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_58' data-id='LK9_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_59' data-id='LK9_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>To another he said, “Follow me.” But he said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_60' data-id='LK9_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead. But as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_61' data-id='LK9_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Yet another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but let me first say farewell to those at my home.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_62' data-id='LK9_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.” </span></div></div>
