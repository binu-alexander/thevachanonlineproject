<div class='s'>The Jerusalem Council </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_1' data-id='AC15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.” </span>
<span class='v AC15_2' data-id='AC15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. </span>
<span class='v AC15_3' data-id='AC15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers. </span>
<span class='v AC15_4' data-id='AC15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. </span>
<span class='v AC15_5' data-id='AC15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_6' data-id='AC15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. </span>
<span class='v AC15_7' data-id='AC15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. </span>
<span class='v AC15_8' data-id='AC15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, </span>
<span class='v AC15_9' data-id='AC15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. </span>
<span class='v AC15_10' data-id='AC15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? </span>
<span class='v AC15_11' data-id='AC15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_12' data-id='AC15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v AC15_13' data-id='AC15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>After they finished speaking, James replied, “Brothers, listen to me. </span>
<span class='v AC15_14' data-id='AC15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. </span>
<span class='v AC15_15' data-id='AC15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> “ ‘After this I will return, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'>and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'>says the Lord, who makes these things </span>
<span class='v AC15_18' data-id='AC15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>known from of old.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC15_19' data-id='AC15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, </span>
<span class='v AC15_20' data-id='AC15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. </span>
<span class='v AC15_21' data-id='AC15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Council's Letter to Gentile Believers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_22' data-id='AC15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, </span>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>with the following letter: “The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. </span>
<span class='v AC15_24' data-id='AC15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, </span>
<span class='v AC15_25' data-id='AC15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, </span>
<span class='v AC15_26' data-id='AC15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC15_27' data-id='AC15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. </span>
<span class='v AC15_28' data-id='AC15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements: </span>
<span class='v AC15_29' data-id='AC15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_30' data-id='AC15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. </span>
<span class='v AC15_31' data-id='AC15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. </span>
<span class='v AC15_32' data-id='AC15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. </span>
<span class='v AC15_33' data-id='AC15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. </span>
<span class='v AC15_35' data-id='AC15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul and Barnabas Separate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_36' data-id='AC15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.” </span>
<span class='v AC15_37' data-id='AC15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. </span>
<span class='v AC15_38' data-id='AC15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. </span>
<span class='v AC15_39' data-id='AC15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, </span>
<span class='v AC15_40' data-id='AC15_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC15_41' data-id='AC15_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. </span></div></div>
