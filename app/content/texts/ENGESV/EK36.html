<span class='v EK36_4' data-id='EK36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around, </span>
<span class='v EK36_5' data-id='EK36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey. </span>
<span class='v EK36_6' data-id='EK36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations. </span>

<span class='v EK36_18' data-id='EK36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. </span>
<span class='v EK36_19' data-id='EK36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them. </span>
