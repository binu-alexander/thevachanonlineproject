<div class='s'>The LORD Accepts Aaron's Offering </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_1' data-id='LV9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel, </span>
<span class='v LV9_2' data-id='LV9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the LORD. </span>
<span class='v LV9_3' data-id='LV9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And say to the people of Israel, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering, </span>
<span class='v LV9_4' data-id='LV9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.’ ” </span>
<span class='v LV9_5' data-id='LV9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. </span>
<span class='v LV9_6' data-id='LV9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Moses said, “This is the thing that the LORD commanded you to do, that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.” </span>
<span class='v LV9_7' data-id='LV9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the LORD has commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_8' data-id='LV9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself. </span>
<span class='v LV9_9' data-id='LV9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_10' data-id='LV9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, as the LORD commanded Moses. </span>
<span class='v LV9_11' data-id='LV9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_12' data-id='LV9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_13' data-id='LV9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_14' data-id='LV9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_15' data-id='LV9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then he presented the people's offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and offered it as a sin offering, like the first one. </span>
<span class='v LV9_16' data-id='LV9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the rule. </span>
<span class='v LV9_17' data-id='LV9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_18' data-id='LV9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then he killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron's sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_19' data-id='LV9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver— </span>
<span class='v LV9_20' data-id='LV9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>they put the fat pieces on the breasts, and he burned the fat pieces on the altar, </span>
<span class='v LV9_21' data-id='LV9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD, as Moses commanded. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_22' data-id='LV9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings. </span>
<span class='v LV9_23' data-id='LV9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people. </span>
<span class='v LV9_24' data-id='LV9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces. </span></div></div>
