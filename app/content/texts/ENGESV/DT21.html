<span class='v DT21_2' data-id='DT21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure the distance to the surrounding cities. </span>

<span class='v DT21_5' data-id='DT21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the LORD, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled. </span>
<span class='v DT21_6' data-id='DT21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And all the el ders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, </span>
