<div class='s'>God Blesses and Renames Jacob </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_1' data-id='GN35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_2' data-id='GN35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. </span>
<span class='v GN35_3' data-id='GN35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then let us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_4' data-id='GN35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears. Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that was near Shechem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_5' data-id='GN35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN35_6' data-id='GN35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him, </span>
<span class='v GN35_7' data-id='GN35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother. </span>
<span class='v GN35_8' data-id='GN35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So he called its name Allon-bacuth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_9' data-id='GN35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him. </span>
<span class='v GN35_10' data-id='GN35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name.” So he called his name Israel. </span>
<span class='v GN35_11' data-id='GN35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from your own body. </span>
<span class='v GN35_12' data-id='GN35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after you.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_13' data-id='GN35_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him. </span>
<span class='v GN35_14' data-id='GN35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. </span>
<span class='v GN35_15' data-id='GN35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him Bethel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_16' data-id='GN35_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then they journeyed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labor, and she had hard labor. </span>
<span class='v GN35_17' data-id='GN35_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when her labor was at its hardest, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you have another son.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_18' data-id='GN35_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And as her soul was departing (for she was dying), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called him Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v GN35_19' data-id='GN35_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), </span>
<span class='v GN35_20' data-id='GN35_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and Jacob set up a pillar over her tomb. It is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day. </span>
<span class='v GN35_21' data-id='GN35_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_22' data-id='GN35_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>While Israel lived in that land, Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine. And Israel heard of it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_22' data-id='GN35_22'>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. </span>
<span class='v GN35_23' data-id='GN35_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. </span>
<span class='v GN35_24' data-id='GN35_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v GN35_25' data-id='GN35_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali. </span>
<span class='v GN35_26' data-id='GN35_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_27' data-id='GN35_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. </span>
<span class='v GN35_28' data-id='GN35_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. </span>
<span class='v GN35_29' data-id='GN35_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. </span></div></div>
