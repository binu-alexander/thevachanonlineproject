<span class='v DN4_4' data-id='DN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace. </span>
<span class='v DN4_5' data-id='DN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. </span>
<span class='v DN4_6' data-id='DN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. </span>
<span class='v DN4_7' data-id='DN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told the dream before them; but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation. </span>
<span class='v DN4_8' data-id='DN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before him, saying, </span></div>

<span class='v DN4_9' data-id='DN4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and its interpretation. </span>
<span class='v DN4_10' data-id='DN4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Thus were the visions of my head on my bed: I saw, and behold, a tree in the middle of the earth; and its height was great. </span>

<span class='v DN4_12' data-id='DN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The leaves of it were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it. </span></div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_13' data-id='DN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky. </span>
<span class='v DN4_14' data-id='DN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He cried aloud, and said this, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. </span>
<span class='v DN4_15' data-id='DN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky.

<span class='v DN4_19' data-id='DN4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you.” </span></div>

<span class='v DN4_19' data-id='DN4_19'>Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries. </span>

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_23' data-id='DN4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“Whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from the sky, and saying, ‘Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of the sky.

<span class='v DN4_24' data-id='DN4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“This is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come on my lord the king: </span>
<span class='v DN4_25' data-id='DN4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>that you shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field.

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_28' data-id='DN4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class='v DN4_29' data-id='DN4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v DN4_30' data-id='DN4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The king spoke and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” </span></div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_31' data-id='DN4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice came from the sky, saying, “O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: ‘The kingdom has departed from you. </span>
<span class='v DN4_32' data-id='DN4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>You shall be driven from men; and your dwelling shall be with the animals of the field.

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_33' data-id='DN4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar.

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_34' data-id='DN4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; </span></div>

<span class='v DN4_36' data-id='DN4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me. My counselors and my lords sought me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me. </span>
<span class='v DN4_37' data-id='DN4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase. </span></div></div>
