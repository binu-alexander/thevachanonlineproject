<span class='v GN4_2' data-id='GN4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Again she gave birth, to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. </span>
<span class='v GN4_3' data-id='GN4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As time passed, Cain brought an offering to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground. </span>
<span class='v GN4_4' data-id='GN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. Yahweh respected Abel and his offering, </span>
<span class='v GN4_5' data-id='GN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering. Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. </span>
<span class='v GN4_6' data-id='GN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen? </span>
<span class='v GN4_7' data-id='GN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If you do well, won’t it be lifted up? If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you, but you are to rule over it.” </span>
<span class='v GN4_8' data-id='GN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Cain said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him. </span></div>
