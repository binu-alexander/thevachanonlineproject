<span class='v K114_1' data-id='K114_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick. </span>
<span class='v K114_2' data-id='K114_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jeroboam said to his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, so that you won’t be recognized as Jeroboam’s wife. Go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said that I would be king over this people. </span>
<span class='v K114_3' data-id='K114_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will become of the child.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_4' data-id='K114_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. </span>
<span class='v K114_5' data-id='K114_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Ahijah, “Behold, Jeroboam’s wife is coming to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick. Tell her such and such; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_6' data-id='K114_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, Jeroboam’s wife! Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news. </span>
<span class='v K114_7' data-id='K114_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: “Because I exalted you from among the people, and made you prince over my people Israel, </span>
<span class='v K114_8' data-id='K114_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and tore the kingdom away from David’s house, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in my eyes, </span>
<span class='v K114_9' data-id='K114_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back; </span>
<span class='v K114_10' data-id='K114_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates on a wall,<span class='note' id='footnote-277'><a href='#note-277' class='key'>*</a></span> he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone. </span>

<span class='v K114_13' data-id='K114_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>All Israel will mourn for him and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. </span>
<span class='v K114_14' data-id='K114_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Moreover Yahweh will raise up a king for himself over Israel, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What? Even now. </span>
<span class='v K114_15' data-id='K114_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,<span class='note' id='footnote-278'><a href='#note-278' class='key'>†</a></span> because they have made their Asherah poles, provoking Yahweh to anger. </span>

<span class='v K114_21' data-id='K114_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.

<span class='v K114_22' data-id='K114_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Judah did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done. </span>
<span class='v K114_23' data-id='K114_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For they also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree. </span>
<span class='v K114_24' data-id='K114_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>There were also sodomites in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K114_25' data-id='K114_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the fifth year of king Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v K114_26' data-id='K114_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and he took away the treasures of Yahweh’s house, and the treasures of the king’s house. He even took away all of it, including all the gold shields which Solomon had made. </span>
<span class='v K114_27' data-id='K114_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. </span>
<span class='v K114_28' data-id='K114_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>It was so, that as often as the king went into Yahweh’s house, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard room. </span></div>
