<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_1' data-id='JN9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. </span>
<span class='v JN9_2' data-id='JN9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_3' data-id='JN9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“This man didn’t sin, nor did his parents; but, that the works of God might be revealed in him. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_4' data-id='JN9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_5' data-id='JN9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_6' data-id='JN9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man’s eyes with the mud, </span>
<span class='v JN9_7' data-id='JN9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Go, wash in the pool of Siloam”</span> (which means “Sent”). So he went away, washed, and came back seeing. </span>
<span class='v JN9_8' data-id='JN9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind before, said, “Isn’t this he who sat and begged?” </span>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Others were saying, “It is he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'>He said, “I am he.” </span>
<span class='v JN9_10' data-id='JN9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They therefore were asking him, “How were your eyes opened?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_11' data-id='JN9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He answered, “A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, <span class='wj'>‘Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.’</span> So I went away and washed, and I received sight.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_12' data-id='JN9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, “Where is he?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_12' data-id='JN9_12'>He said, “I don’t know.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_13' data-id='JN9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees. </span>
<span class='v JN9_14' data-id='JN9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. </span>
<span class='v JN9_15' data-id='JN9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_16' data-id='JN9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” There was division among them. </span>
<span class='v JN9_17' data-id='JN9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore they asked the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_17' data-id='JN9_17'>He said, “He is a prophet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_18' data-id='JN9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore didn’t believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight, </span>
<span class='v JN9_19' data-id='JN9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_20' data-id='JN9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>His parents answered them, “We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; </span>
<span class='v JN9_21' data-id='JN9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself.” </span>
<span class='v JN9_22' data-id='JN9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue. </span>
<span class='v JN9_23' data-id='JN9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Therefore his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_24' data-id='JN9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_25' data-id='JN9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He therefore answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind, now I see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_26' data-id='JN9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They said to him again, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_27' data-id='JN9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He answered them, “I told you already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_28' data-id='JN9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They insulted him and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. </span>
<span class='v JN9_29' data-id='JN9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_30' data-id='JN9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The man answered them, “How amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. </span>
<span class='v JN9_31' data-id='JN9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.<span class='note' id='footnote-947'><a href='#note-947' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_32' data-id='JN9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind. </span>
<span class='v JN9_33' data-id='JN9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_34' data-id='JN9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him out. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_35' data-id='JN9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, <span class='wj'>“Do you believe in the Son of God?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_36' data-id='JN9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_37' data-id='JN9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_38' data-id='JN9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he worshiped him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_39' data-id='JN9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I came into this world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who see may become blind.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_40' data-id='JN9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_41' data-id='JN9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains.</span> </span></div></div>
