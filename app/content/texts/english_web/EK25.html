<span class='v EK25_2' data-id='EK25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face toward the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them. </span>
<span class='v EK25_3' data-id='EK25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Tell the children of Ammon, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh!

<span class='v EK25_4' data-id='EK25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession. They will set their encampments in you, and make their dwellings in you. They will eat your fruit and they will drink your milk. </span>
<span class='v EK25_5' data-id='EK25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” </span>
<span class='v EK25_6' data-id='EK25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For the Lord Yahweh says: “Because you have clapped your hands, stamped with the feet, and rejoiced with all the contempt of your soul against the land of Israel; </span>
<span class='v EK25_7' data-id='EK25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a plunder to the nations.
