<span class='v ZC6_2' data-id='ZC6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In the first chariot were red horses; in the second chariot black horses; </span>
<span class='v ZC6_3' data-id='ZC6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot dappled horses, all of them powerful. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_4' data-id='ZC6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC6_5' data-id='ZC6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The angel answered me, “These are the four winds of the sky, which go out from standing before the Lord of all the earth. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_6' data-id='ZC6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The one with the black horses goes out toward the north country; and the white went out after them; and the dappled went out toward the south country.” </span>
<span class='v ZC6_7' data-id='ZC6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The strong went out, and sought to go that they might walk back and forth through the earth: and he said, “Go around and through the earth!” So they walked back and forth through the earth. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC6_8' data-id='ZC6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he called to me, and spoke to me, saying, “Behold, those who go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC6_13' data-id='ZC6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>even he shall build Yahweh’s temple; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. </span>
