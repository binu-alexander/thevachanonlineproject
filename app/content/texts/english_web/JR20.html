<span class='v JR20_1' data-id='JR20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in Yahweh’s house, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things. </span>
<span class='v JR20_2' data-id='JR20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in Yahweh’s house. </span>
<span class='v JR20_3' data-id='JR20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On the next day, Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, “Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.<span class='note' id='footnote-512'><a href='#note-512' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v JR20_4' data-id='JR20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will kill them with the sword. </span>
<span class='v JR20_5' data-id='JR20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies. They will make them captives, take them, and carry them to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR20_6' data-id='JR20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity. You will come to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.’ ” </span></div>
