<span class='v TT3_2' data-id='TT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. </span>
<span class='v TT3_3' data-id='TT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. </span>
<span class='v TT3_4' data-id='TT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, </span>

<span class='v TT3_9' data-id='TT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. </span>
