<span class='v S29_2' data-id='S29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There was of Saul’s house a servant whose name was Ziba, and they called him to David; and the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” </span></div>

<span class='v S29_3' data-id='S29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The king said, “Is there not yet any of Saul’s house, that I may show the kindness of God to him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_3' data-id='S29_3'>Ziba said to the king, “Jonathan still has a son, who is lame in his feet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_4' data-id='S29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king said to him, “Where is he?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_4' data-id='S29_4'>Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo Debar.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_5' data-id='S29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then king David sent, and brought him out of the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar. </span>
<span class='v S29_6' data-id='S29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and fell on his face, and showed respect. David said, “Mephibosheth.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_7' data-id='S29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>David said to him, “Don’t be afraid; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father’s sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father. You will eat bread at my table continually.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S29_8' data-id='S29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He bowed down, and said, “What is your servant, that you should look at such a dead dog as I am?” </span>
<span class='v S29_9' data-id='S29_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “All that belonged to Saul and to all his house I have given to your master’s son. </span>
<span class='v S29_10' data-id='S29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants. Bring in the harvest, that your master’s son may have bread to eat; but Mephibosheth your master’s son will always eat bread at my table.” </span></div>
