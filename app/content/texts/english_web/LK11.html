<span class='v LK11_37' data-id='LK11_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him to dine with him. He went in, and sat at the table. </span>

<span class='v LK11_53' data-id='LK11_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>As he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be terribly angry, and to draw many things out of him; </span>
