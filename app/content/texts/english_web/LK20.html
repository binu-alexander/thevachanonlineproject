<span class='v LK20_2' data-id='LK20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?” </span></div>

<span class='v LK20_5' data-id='LK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
