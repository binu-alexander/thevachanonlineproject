<span class='v CL3_5' data-id='CL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. </span>
<span class='v CL3_6' data-id='CL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. </span>

<span class='v CL3_12' data-id='CL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance; </span>
<span class='v CL3_13' data-id='CL3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do. </span></div>

<span class='v CL3_23' data-id='CL3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men, </span>
<span class='v CL3_24' data-id='CL3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. </span>
