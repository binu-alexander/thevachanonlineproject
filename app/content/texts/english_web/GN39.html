<span class='v GN39_2' data-id='GN39_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. </span>

<span class='v GN39_4' data-id='GN39_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. </span>
<span class='v GN39_5' data-id='GN39_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, Yahweh blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake. Yahweh’s blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. </span>
<span class='v GN39_6' data-id='GN39_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate. </span></div>

<span class='v GN39_8' data-id='GN39_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But he refused, and said to his master’s wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand. </span>
<span class='v GN39_9' data-id='GN39_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>No one is greater in this house than I am, and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” </span></div>

<span class='v GN39_15' data-id='GN39_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.” </span>
<span class='v GN39_16' data-id='GN39_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home. </span>
