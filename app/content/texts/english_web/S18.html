<span class='v S18_7' data-id='S18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me as the king over them. </span>
<span class='v S18_8' data-id='S18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day, in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so they also do to you. </span>
<span class='v S18_9' data-id='S18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now therefore listen to their voice. However you shall protest solemnly to them, and shall show them the way of the king who will reign over them.” </span></div>

<span class='v S18_12' data-id='S18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He will appoint them to him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and he will assign some to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots. </span>
<span class='v S18_13' data-id='S18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He will take your daughters to be perfumers, to be cooks, and to be bakers. </span>
