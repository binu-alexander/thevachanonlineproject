<span class='v MK7_5' data-id='MK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?” </span></div>

<span class='v MK7_24' data-id='MK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. </span>
<span class='v MK7_25' data-id='MK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. </span>
<span class='v MK7_26' data-id='MK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter. </span>
<span class='v MK7_27' data-id='MK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span> </span></div>

<span class='v MK7_31' data-id='MK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the region of Decapolis. </span>
<span class='v MK7_32' data-id='MK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him. </span>

<span class='v MK7_34' data-id='MK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Ephphatha!” </span> that is, <span class='wj'>“Be opened!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_35' data-id='MK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. </span>
<span class='v MK7_36' data-id='MK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. </span>
<span class='v MK7_37' data-id='MK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!” </span></div></div>
