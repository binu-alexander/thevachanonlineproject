<span class='v HB3_1' data-id='HB3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus, </span>
<span class='v HB3_2' data-id='HB3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house. </span>
<span class='v HB3_3' data-id='HB3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the house. </span>
<span class='v HB3_4' data-id='HB3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For every house is built by someone; but he who built all things is God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_5' data-id='HB3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken, </span>
<span class='v HB3_6' data-id='HB3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but Christ is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end. </span>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I was displeased with that generation, </span></div>

<span class='v HB3_12' data-id='HB3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; </span>
<span class='v HB3_13' data-id='HB3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. </span>
<span class='v HB3_14' data-id='HB3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end, </span>

<span class='v HB3_17' data-id='HB3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>With whom was he displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? </span>
<span class='v HB3_18' data-id='HB3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>To whom did he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were disobedient? </span>
