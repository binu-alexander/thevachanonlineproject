<span class='v RM2_1' data-id='RM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are who judge. For in that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you who judge practice the same things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_2' data-id='RM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who practice such things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_3' data-id='RM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do you think this, O man who judges those who practice such things, and do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God? </span>
<span class='v RM2_4' data-id='RM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness, forbearance, and patience, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? </span>
<span class='v RM2_5' data-id='RM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But according to your hardness and unrepentant heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath, revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God; </span>
<span class='v RM2_6' data-id='RM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who “will pay back to everyone according to their works:”<span class='note' id='footnote-1075'><a href='#note-1075' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM2_7' data-id='RM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>to those who by perseverance in well-doing seek for glory, honor, and incorruptibility, eternal life; </span>
<span class='v RM2_8' data-id='RM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but to those who are self-seeking, and don’t obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, will be wrath, indignation, </span>
<span class='v RM2_9' data-id='RM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>oppression, and anguish on every soul of man who does evil, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_10' data-id='RM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But glory, honor, and peace go to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. </span>
<span class='v RM2_11' data-id='RM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For there is no partiality with God. </span>
<span class='v RM2_12' data-id='RM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For as many as have sinned without the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_13' data-id='RM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law will be justified </span>
<span class='v RM2_14' data-id='RM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>(for when Gentiles who don’t have the law do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law to themselves, </span>
<span class='v RM2_15' data-id='RM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying with them, and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else excusing them) </span>
<span class='v RM2_16' data-id='RM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men, according to my Good News, by Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_17' data-id='RM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Indeed you bear the name of a Jew, rest on the law, glory in God, </span>
<span class='v RM2_18' data-id='RM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law, </span>
<span class='v RM2_19' data-id='RM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, </span>
<span class='v RM2_20' data-id='RM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth. </span>
<span class='v RM2_21' data-id='RM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You therefore who teach another, don’t you teach yourself? You who preach that a man shouldn’t steal, do you steal? </span>
<span class='v RM2_22' data-id='RM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You who say a man shouldn’t commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? </span>
<span class='v RM2_23' data-id='RM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You who glory in the law, do you dishonor God by disobeying the law? </span>
<span class='v RM2_24' data-id='RM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For “the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,” <span class='note' id='footnote-1076'><a href='#note-1076' class='key'>✡</a></span> just as it is written. </span>
<span class='v RM2_25' data-id='RM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For circumcision indeed profits, if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. </span>
<span class='v RM2_26' data-id='RM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>If therefore the uncircumcised keep the ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM2_27' data-id='RM2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Won’t the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfills the law, judge you, who with the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? </span>
<span class='v RM2_28' data-id='RM2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; </span>
<span class='v RM2_29' data-id='RM2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. </span></div></div>
