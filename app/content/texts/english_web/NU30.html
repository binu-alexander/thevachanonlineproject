<span class='v NU30_2' data-id='NU30_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. </span></div>

<span class='v NU30_4' data-id='NU30_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound her soul, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge with which she has bound her soul shall stand. </span>
<span class='v NU30_5' data-id='NU30_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if her father forbids her in the day that he hears, none of her vows or of her pledges with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. Yahweh will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her. </span></div>

<span class='v NU30_7' data-id='NU30_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and her husband hears it, and says nothing to her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges with which she has bound her soul shall stand. </span>
<span class='v NU30_8' data-id='NU30_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he makes void her vow which is on her and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul. Yahweh will forgive her. </span></div>

<span class='v NU30_13' data-id='NU30_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. </span>
