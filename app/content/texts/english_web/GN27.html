<span class='v GN27_5' data-id='GN27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. </span>
<span class='v GN27_6' data-id='GN27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, “Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying, </span>

<span class='v GN27_12' data-id='GN27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>What if my father touches me? I will seem to him as a deceiver, and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_13' data-id='GN27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them for me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_14' data-id='GN27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother. His mother made savory food, such as his father loved. </span>

<span class='v GN27_23' data-id='GN27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He didn’t recognize him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother, Esau’s hands. So he blessed him. </span>

<span class='v GN27_30' data-id='GN27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. </span>
<span class='v GN27_31' data-id='GN27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He also made savory food, and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_37' data-id='GN27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Isaac answered Esau, “Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?” </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>that you will shake his yoke from off your neck.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_41' data-id='GN27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother Jacob.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_42' data-id='GN27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. </span>

<span class='v GN27_45' data-id='GN27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_46' data-id='GN27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth.
