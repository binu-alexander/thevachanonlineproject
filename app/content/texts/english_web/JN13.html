<span class='v JN13_1' data-id='JN13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. </span>
<span class='v JN13_2' data-id='JN13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him, </span>
<span class='v JN13_3' data-id='JN13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and was going to God, </span>
<span class='v JN13_4' data-id='JN13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist. </span>
<span class='v JN13_5' data-id='JN13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him. </span>
<span class='v JN13_6' data-id='JN13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_7' data-id='JN13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_8' data-id='JN13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_8' data-id='JN13_8'>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_9' data-id='JN13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_10' data-id='JN13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.” </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_11' data-id='JN13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he knew him who would betray him, therefore he said, <span class='wj'>“You are not all clean.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_12' data-id='JN13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Do you know what I have done to you? </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_13' data-id='JN13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You call me, ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord.’ You say so correctly, for so I am. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_14' data-id='JN13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_15' data-id='JN13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For I have given you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_16' data-id='JN13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither is one who is sent greater than he who sent him. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_17' data-id='JN13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_18' data-id='JN13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I don’t speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-966'><a href='#note-966' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_19' data-id='JN13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_20' data-id='JN13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_21' data-id='JN13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_22' data-id='JN13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The disciples looked at one another, perplexed about whom he spoke. </span>
<span class='v JN13_23' data-id='JN13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast. </span>
<span class='v JN13_24' data-id='JN13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_25' data-id='JN13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He, leaning back, as he was, on Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_26' data-id='JN13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore answered, <span class='wj'>“It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.”</span> So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. </span>
<span class='v JN13_27' data-id='JN13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_27' data-id='JN13_27'>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“What you do, do quickly.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_28' data-id='JN13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now nobody at the table knew why he said this to him. </span>
<span class='v JN13_29' data-id='JN13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy what things we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor. </span>
<span class='v JN13_30' data-id='JN13_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_31' data-id='JN13_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_32' data-id='JN13_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_33' data-id='JN13_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Little children, I will be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I tell you. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_34' data-id='JN13_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN13_35' data-id='JN13_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_36' data-id='JN13_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_36' data-id='JN13_36'>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Where I am going, you can’t follow now, but you will follow afterwards.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_37' data-id='JN13_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_38' data-id='JN13_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“Will you lay down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won’t crow until you have denied me three times.</span> </span></div></div>
