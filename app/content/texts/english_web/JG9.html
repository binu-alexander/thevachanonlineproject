<span class='v JG9_2' data-id='JG9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.” </span></div>

<span class='v JG9_3' data-id='JG9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His mother’s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. Their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.” </span>
<span class='v JG9_4' data-id='JG9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and reckless fellows who followed him. </span>
<span class='v JG9_5' data-id='JG9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. </span>
<span class='v JG9_6' data-id='JG9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together with all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem. </span>

<span class='v JG9_19' data-id='JG9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal and with his house today, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you; </span>

<span class='v JG9_21' data-id='JG9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jotham ran away and fled, and went to Beer<span class='note' id='footnote-205'><a href='#note-205' class='key'>*</a></span> and lived there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_22' data-id='JG9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Abimelech was prince over Israel three years. </span>
<span class='v JG9_23' data-id='JG9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, </span>
<span class='v JG9_24' data-id='JG9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother who killed them, and on the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. </span>
<span class='v JG9_25' data-id='JG9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them; and Abimelech was told about it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_26' data-id='JG9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him. </span>
<span class='v JG9_27' data-id='JG9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They went out into the field, harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, celebrated, and went into the house of their god and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. </span>
<span class='v JG9_28' data-id='JG9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him?

<span class='v JG9_29' data-id='JG9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I wish that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech, “Increase your army and come out!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_30' data-id='JG9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned. </span>
<span class='v JG9_31' data-id='JG9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against you. </span>
<span class='v JG9_32' data-id='JG9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, go up by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. </span>
<span class='v JG9_33' data-id='JG9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>It shall be that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush on the city. Behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_34' data-id='JG9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. </span>
<span class='v JG9_35' data-id='JG9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambush. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_36' data-id='JG9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_36' data-id='JG9_36'>Zebul said to him, “You see the shadows of the mountains as if they were men.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_37' data-id='JG9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_38' data-id='JG9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_39' data-id='JG9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. </span>
<span class='v JG9_40' data-id='JG9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the entrance of the gate. </span>
<span class='v JG9_41' data-id='JG9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Abimelech lived at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem. </span>
<span class='v JG9_42' data-id='JG9_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>On the next day, the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. </span>
<span class='v JG9_43' data-id='JG9_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He took the people and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold, the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them and struck them. </span>
<span class='v JG9_44' data-id='JG9_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Abimelech and the companies that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field and struck them. </span>
<span class='v JG9_45' data-id='JG9_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city and killed the people in it. He beat down the city and sowed it with salt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_46' data-id='JG9_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith. </span>
<span class='v JG9_47' data-id='JG9_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Abimelech was told that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. </span>
<span class='v JG9_48' data-id='JG9_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!” </span>
<span class='v JG9_49' data-id='JG9_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>All the people likewise each cut down his bough, followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. </span>
<span class='v JG9_50' data-id='JG9_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez, and took it. </span>
<span class='v JG9_51' data-id='JG9_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of the city fled there, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower. </span>
<span class='v JG9_52' data-id='JG9_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. </span>
<span class='v JG9_53' data-id='JG9_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_54' data-id='JG9_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Then he called hastily to the young man, his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, that men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young man thrust him through, and he died.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG9_55' data-id='JG9_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place. </span>
<span class='v JG9_56' data-id='JG9_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Thus God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father in killing his seventy brothers; </span>
<span class='v JG9_57' data-id='JG9_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>and God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came on them. </span></div></div>
