<span class='v S25_2' data-id='S25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out and in. Yahweh said to you, ‘You will be shepherd of my people Israel, and you will be prince over Israel.’ ” </span>
<span class='v S25_3' data-id='S25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron, and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Yahweh; and they anointed David king over Israel. </span></div>

<span class='v S25_5' data-id='S25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah. </span>
<span class='v S25_6' data-id='S25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke to David, saying, “The blind and the lame will keep you out of here;” thinking, “David can’t come in here.” </span>
<span class='v S25_7' data-id='S25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless David took the stronghold of Zion. This is David’s city. </span>
<span class='v S25_8' data-id='S25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up to the watercourse and strike those lame and blind, who are hated by David’s soul.” Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame can’t come into the house.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S25_9' data-id='S25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>David lived in the stronghold, and called it David’s city. David built around from Millo and inward. </span>
<span class='v S25_10' data-id='S25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>David grew greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him. </span>

<span class='v S25_17' data-id='S25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David, but David heard about it and went down to the stronghold. </span>
<span class='v S25_18' data-id='S25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v S25_19' data-id='S25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S25_19' data-id='S25_19'>Yahweh said to David, “Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.” </span></div>

<span class='v S25_20' data-id='S25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>David came to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there.

<span class='v S25_23' data-id='S25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When David inquired of Yahweh, he said, “You shall not go up. Circle around behind them, and attack them in front of the mulberry trees. </span>
<span class='v S25_24' data-id='S25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, then stir yourself up; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” </span></div>
