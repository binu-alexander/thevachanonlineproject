<span class='v S12_12' data-id='S12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now the sons of Eli were wicked men. They didn’t know Yahweh. </span>
<span class='v S12_13' data-id='S12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant came while the meat was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand; </span>
<span class='v S12_14' data-id='S12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and he stabbed it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot. The priest took all that the fork brought up for himself. They did this to all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v S12_15' data-id='S12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yes, before they burned the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, “Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_16' data-id='S12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;” then he would say, “No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.” </span>
<span class='v S12_17' data-id='S12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised Yahweh’s offering. </span>
<span class='v S12_18' data-id='S12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod. </span>
<span class='v S12_19' data-id='S12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. </span>
<span class='v S12_20' data-id='S12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, “May Yahweh give you offspring<span class='note' id='footnote-222'><a href='#note-222' class='key'>†</a></span> from this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.” Then they went to their own home. </span>
<span class='v S12_21' data-id='S12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh. </span></div>

<span class='v S12_22' data-id='S12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they slept with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting. </span>
<span class='v S12_23' data-id='S12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all these people. </span>
<span class='v S12_24' data-id='S12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>No, my sons; for it is not a good report that I hear! You make Yahweh’s people disobey. </span>

<span class='v S12_29' data-id='S12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?’ </span>

<span class='v S12_34' data-id='S12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>This will be the sign to you that will come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will both die. </span>
<span class='v S12_35' data-id='S12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>I will raise up a faithful priest for myself who will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house. He will walk before my anointed forever. </span>
<span class='v S12_36' data-id='S12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>It will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, “Please put me into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ” </span></div></div>
