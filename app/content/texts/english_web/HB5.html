<span class='v HB5_2' data-id='HB5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The high priest can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded with weakness. </span>
<span class='v HB5_3' data-id='HB5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Because of this, he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself. </span>
