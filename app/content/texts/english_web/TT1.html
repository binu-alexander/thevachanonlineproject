<span class='v TT1_1' data-id='TT1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, </span>
<span class='v TT1_2' data-id='TT1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; </span>
<span class='v TT1_3' data-id='TT1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior; </span>
<span class='v TT1_4' data-id='TT1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_5' data-id='TT1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you, </span>
<span class='v TT1_6' data-id='TT1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. </span>
<span class='v TT1_7' data-id='TT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; </span>
<span class='v TT1_8' data-id='TT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, </span>
<span class='v TT1_9' data-id='TT1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_10' data-id='TT1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, </span>
<span class='v TT1_11' data-id='TT1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. </span>
<span class='v TT1_12' data-id='TT1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” </span>
<span class='v TT1_13' data-id='TT1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, </span>
<span class='v TT1_14' data-id='TT1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. </span>
<span class='v TT1_15' data-id='TT1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. </span>
<span class='v TT1_16' data-id='TT1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work. </span></div></div>
