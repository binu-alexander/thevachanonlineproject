<span class='v NU9_5' data-id='NU9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did. </span>
<span class='v NU9_6' data-id='NU9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. </span>
<span class='v NU9_7' data-id='NU9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?” </span></div>

<span class='v NU9_11' data-id='NU9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. </span>
<span class='v NU9_12' data-id='NU9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. </span>
