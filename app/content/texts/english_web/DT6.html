<span class='v DT6_2' data-id='DT6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you—you, your son, and your son’s son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged. </span>
<span class='v DT6_3' data-id='DT6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT6_4' data-id='DT6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God. Yahweh is one. </span>

<span class='v DT6_6' data-id='DT6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>These words, which I command you today, shall be on your heart; </span>
<span class='v DT6_7' data-id='DT6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up. </span>
<span class='v DT6_8' data-id='DT6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. </span>

<span class='v DT6_11' data-id='DT6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and houses full of all good things which you didn’t fill, and cisterns dug out which you didn’t dig, vineyards and olive trees which you didn’t plant, and you shall eat and be full; </span>
<span class='v DT6_12' data-id='DT6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </span>

<span class='v DT6_15' data-id='DT6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous God, lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth. </span>
<span class='v DT6_16' data-id='DT6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah. </span>

<span class='v DT6_21' data-id='DT6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>then you shall tell your son, “We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt. Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand; </span>
<span class='v DT6_22' data-id='DT6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes; </span>
<span class='v DT6_23' data-id='DT6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers. </span>
<span class='v DT6_24' data-id='DT6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as we are today. </span>
<span class='v DT6_25' data-id='DT6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all these commandments before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.” </span></div></div>
