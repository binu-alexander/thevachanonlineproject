<span class='v JS18_2' data-id='JS18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Seven tribes remained among the children of Israel, which had not yet divided their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v JS18_3' data-id='JS18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to the children of Israel, “How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you? </span>
<span class='v JS18_4' data-id='JS18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe. I will send them, and they shall arise, walk through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance; then they shall come to me. </span>
<span class='v JS18_5' data-id='JS18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They shall divide it into seven portions. Judah shall live in his borders on the south, and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north. </span>

<span class='v JS18_7' data-id='JS18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>However, the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance east of the Jordan, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS18_8' data-id='JS18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The men arose and went. Joshua commanded those who went to survey the land, saying, “Go walk through the land, survey it, and come again to me. I will cast lots for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.” </span></div>
