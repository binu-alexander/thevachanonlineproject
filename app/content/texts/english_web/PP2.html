<span class='v PP2_1' data-id='PP2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If therefore there is any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, </span>
<span class='v PP2_2' data-id='PP2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>make my joy full by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; </span>
<span class='v PP2_3' data-id='PP2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself; </span>
<span class='v PP2_4' data-id='PP2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_5' data-id='PP2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v PP2_6' data-id='PP2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped, </span>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. </span>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death of the cross. </span>
<span class='v PP2_9' data-id='PP2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name, </span>
<span class='v PP2_10' data-id='PP2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth, </span>
<span class='v PP2_11' data-id='PP2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_12' data-id='PP2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. </span>
<span class='v PP2_13' data-id='PP2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure. </span>
<span class='v PP2_14' data-id='PP2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do all things without complaining and arguing, </span>
<span class='v PP2_15' data-id='PP2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world, </span>
<span class='v PP2_16' data-id='PP2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>holding up the word of life, that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn’t run in vain nor labor in vain. </span>
<span class='v PP2_17' data-id='PP2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all. </span>
<span class='v PP2_18' data-id='PP2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_19' data-id='PP2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing. </span>
<span class='v PP2_20' data-id='PP2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_21' data-id='PP2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP2_22' data-id='PP2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But you know the proof of him, that as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News. </span>
<span class='v PP2_23' data-id='PP2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me. </span>
<span class='v PP2_24' data-id='PP2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly. </span>
<span class='v PP2_25' data-id='PP2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need, </span>
<span class='v PP2_26' data-id='PP2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled because you had heard that he was sick. </span>
<span class='v PP2_27' data-id='PP2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow. </span>
<span class='v PP2_28' data-id='PP2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. </span>
<span class='v PP2_29' data-id='PP2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such people in honor, </span>
<span class='v PP2_30' data-id='PP2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me. </span></div></div>
