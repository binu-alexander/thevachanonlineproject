<span class='v DT20_11' data-id='DT20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It shall be, if it gives you answer of peace and opens to you, then it shall be that all the people who are found therein shall become forced laborers to you, and shall serve you. </span>

You shall not cut them down, for is the tree of the field man, that it should be besieged by you? </span>
<span class='v DT20_20' data-id='DT20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Only the trees that you know are not trees for food, you shall destroy and cut them down. You shall build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you, until it falls. </span></div></div>
