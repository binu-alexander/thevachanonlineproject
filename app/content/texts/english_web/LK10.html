<span class='v LK10_2' data-id='LK10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“The harvest is indeed plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest. </span> </span>

<span class='v LK10_22' data-id='LK10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Turning to the disciples, he said, <span class='wj'>“All things have been delivered to me by my Father.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_25' data-id='LK10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested him, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” </span></div>

<span class='v LK10_30' data-id='LK10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. </span> </span>

<span class='v LK10_35' data-id='LK10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.’ </span> </span>
<span class='v LK10_36' data-id='LK10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK10_40' data-id='LK10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she came up to him, and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Ask her therefore to help me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_41' data-id='LK10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered her, <span class='wj'>“Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, </span> </span>
