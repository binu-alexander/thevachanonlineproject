<span class='v RM11_1' data-id='RM11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v RM11_2' data-id='RM11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel: </span>
<span class='v RM11_3' data-id='RM11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my life.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1124'><a href='#note-1124' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM11_4' data-id='RM11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1125'><a href='#note-1125' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM11_5' data-id='RM11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace. </span>
<span class='v RM11_6' data-id='RM11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_7' data-id='RM11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened. </span>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.” <span class='note' id='footnote-1126'><a href='#note-1126' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>David says, </span></div>

<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'>“Let their table be made a snare, a trap, </span></div>

<span class='v RM11_10' data-id='RM11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. </span></div>

<span class='v RM11_11' data-id='RM11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. </span>
<span class='v RM11_12' data-id='RM11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness? </span>
<span class='v RM11_13' data-id='RM11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; </span>
<span class='v RM11_14' data-id='RM11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them. </span>
<span class='v RM11_15' data-id='RM11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead? </span>
<span class='v RM11_16' data-id='RM11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. </span>
<span class='v RM11_17' data-id='RM11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree, </span>
<span class='v RM11_18' data-id='RM11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you. </span>
<span class='v RM11_19' data-id='RM11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.” </span>
<span class='v RM11_20' data-id='RM11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear; </span>
<span class='v RM11_21' data-id='RM11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. </span>
<span class='v RM11_22' data-id='RM11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off. </span>
<span class='v RM11_23' data-id='RM11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. </span>
<span class='v RM11_24' data-id='RM11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_25' data-id='RM11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers,<span class='note' id='footnote-1128'><a href='#note-1128' class='key'>*</a></span> of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, </span>
<span class='v RM11_26' data-id='RM11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, </span></div>

<span class='v RM11_29' data-id='RM11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. </span>
<span class='v RM11_30' data-id='RM11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, </span>
<span class='v RM11_31' data-id='RM11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy. </span>
