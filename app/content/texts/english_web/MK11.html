<span class='v MK11_2' data-id='MK11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go your way into the village that is opposite you.

<span class='v MK11_4' data-id='MK11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They went away, and found a young donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him. </span>
<span class='v MK11_5' data-id='MK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Some of those who stood there asked them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?” </span>
<span class='v MK11_6' data-id='MK11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They said to them just as Jesus had said, and they let them go. </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_7' data-id='MK11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They brought the young donkey to Jesus, and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. </span>
<span class='v MK11_8' data-id='MK11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Many spread their garments on the way, and others were cutting down branches from the trees, and spreading them on the road. </span>
<span class='v MK11_9' data-id='MK11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Those who went in front, and those who followed, cried out, “Hosanna! <span class='note' id='footnote-816'><a href='#note-816' class='key'>†</a></span> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<span class='note' id='footnote-817'><a href='#note-817' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>

<span class='v MK11_11' data-id='MK11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus entered into the temple in Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_12' data-id='MK11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The next day, when they had come out from Bethany, he was hungry. </span>
<span class='v MK11_13' data-id='MK11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. </span>
<span class='v MK11_14' data-id='MK11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus told it, <span class='wj'>“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” </span> and his disciples heard it. </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_15' data-id='MK11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus entered into the temple, and began to throw out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables, and the seats of those who sold the doves. </span>
<span class='v MK11_16' data-id='MK11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He would not allow anyone to carry a container through the temple. </span>
<span class='v MK11_17' data-id='MK11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He taught, saying to them, <span class='wj'>“Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations?’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-818'><a href='#note-818' class='key'>✡</a></span> <span class='wj'>But you have made it a den of robbers!”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-819'><a href='#note-819' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_18' data-id='MK11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_19' data-id='MK11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When evening came, he went out of the city. </span>
<span class='v MK11_20' data-id='MK11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. </span>
<span class='v MK11_21' data-id='MK11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Peter, remembering, said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.” </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_22' data-id='MK11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Have faith in God. </span> </span>

<span class='v MK11_24' data-id='MK11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore I tell you, all things whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall have them. </span> </span>

<span class='v MK11_31' data-id='MK11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v MK11_32' data-id='MK11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>If we should say, ‘From men’ ”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a prophet. </span>
