<span class='v K18_1' data-id='K18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, with all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh’s covenant out of David’s city, which is Zion. </span>
<span class='v K18_2' data-id='K18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast, in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. </span>
<span class='v K18_3' data-id='K18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All the elders of Israel came, and the priests picked up the ark. </span>
<span class='v K18_4' data-id='K18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They brought up Yahweh’s ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The priests and the Levites brought these up. </span>
<span class='v K18_5' data-id='K18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle, that could not be counted or numbered for multitude. </span>
<span class='v K18_6' data-id='K18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The priests brought in the ark of Yahweh’s covenant to its place, into the inner sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the cherubim’s wings. </span>
<span class='v K18_7' data-id='K18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. </span>
<span class='v K18_8' data-id='K18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they were not seen outside. They are there to this day. </span>
<span class='v K18_9' data-id='K18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at Horeb, when Yahweh made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v K18_10' data-id='K18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled Yahweh’s house, </span>
<span class='v K18_11' data-id='K18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud; for Yahweh’s glory filled Yahweh’s house. </span>
<span class='v K18_12' data-id='K18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. </span>

<span class='v K18_20' data-id='K18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has established his word that he spoke; for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, as Yahweh promised, and have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K18_21' data-id='K18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>There I have set a place for the ark, in which is Yahweh’s covenant, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.” </span></div>

<span class='v K18_22' data-id='K18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Solomon stood before Yahweh’s altar in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands toward heaven; </span>
<span class='v K18_23' data-id='K18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and he said, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keeps covenant and loving kindness with your servants, who walk before you with all their heart; </span>

<span class='v K18_54' data-id='K18_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>It was so, that when Solomon had finished praying all this prayer and supplication to Yahweh, he arose from before Yahweh’s altar, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread out toward heaven. </span>

<span class='v K18_62' data-id='K18_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh. </span>
<span class='v K18_63' data-id='K18_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered to Yahweh, twenty two thousand head of cattle, and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated Yahweh’s house. </span>
<span class='v K18_64' data-id='K18_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>The same day the king made the middle of the court holy that was before Yahweh’s house; for there he offered the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings. </span>
<span class='v K18_65' data-id='K18_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven more days, even fourteen days. </span>
<span class='v K18_66' data-id='K18_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad in their hearts for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant, and to Israel his people. </span></div></div>
