<span class='v DT30_17' data-id='DT30_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but are drawn away and worship other gods, and serve them, </span>

<span class='v DT30_20' data-id='DT30_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days, that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. </span></div></div>
