<span class='v C15_1' data-id='C15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and such sexual immorality as is not even named among the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. </span>
<span class='v C15_2' data-id='C15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead, that he who had done this deed might be removed from among you. </span>
<span class='v C15_3' data-id='C15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I most certainly, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him who has done this thing. </span>
<span class='v C15_4' data-id='C15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v C15_5' data-id='C15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>are to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. </span></div>

<span class='v C15_6' data-id='C15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? </span>
<span class='v C15_7' data-id='C15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, has been sacrificed in our place. </span>
<span class='v C15_8' data-id='C15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </span></div>

<span class='v C15_9' data-id='C15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I wrote to you in my letter to have no company with sexual sinners; </span>
<span class='v C15_10' data-id='C15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters; for then you would have to leave the world. </span>
<span class='v C15_11' data-id='C15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But as it is, I wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person. </span>
<span class='v C15_12' data-id='C15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For what do I have to do with also judging those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? </span>
<span class='v C15_13' data-id='C15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But those who are outside, God judges. “Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1157'><a href='#note-1157' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span></div></div>
