<span class='v ZC8_2' data-id='ZC8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies says: “I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_3' data-id='ZC8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh says: “I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the middle of Jerusalem. Jerusalem shall be called ‘The City of Truth;’ and the mountain of Yahweh of Armies, ‘The Holy Mountain.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_4' data-id='ZC8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies says: “Old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_5' data-id='ZC8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC8_8' data-id='ZC8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_9' data-id='ZC8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies says: “Let your hands be strong, you who hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets who were in the day that the foundation of the house of Yahweh of Armies was laid, even the temple, that it might be built. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_10' data-id='ZC8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For before those days there was no wages for man, nor any wages for an animal; neither was there any peace to him who went out or came in, because of the adversary. For I set all men everyone against his neighbor. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_11' data-id='ZC8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as in the former days,” says Yahweh of Armies. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_12' data-id='ZC8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“For the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit, and the ground will give its increase, and the heavens will give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_13' data-id='ZC8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>It shall come to pass that, as you were a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you shall be a blessing. Don’t be afraid. Let your hands be strong.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_14' data-id='ZC8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh of Armies says: “As I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath,” says Yahweh of Armies, “and I didn’t repent; </span>
<span class='v ZC8_15' data-id='ZC8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>so again I have thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Don’t be afraid. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_16' data-id='ZC8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These are the things that you shall do: speak every man the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates, </span>
<span class='v ZC8_17' data-id='ZC8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor, and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate,” says Yahweh. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_18' data-id='ZC8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The word of Yahweh of Armies came to me. </span>

<span class='v ZC8_22' data-id='ZC8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Yes, many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Yahweh of Armies in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of Yahweh.” </span>
<span class='v ZC8_23' data-id='ZC8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies says: “In those days, ten men will take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they will take hold of the skirt of him who is a Jew, saying, ‘We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’ ” </span></div></div>
