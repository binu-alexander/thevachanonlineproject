<span class='v MK3_1' data-id='MK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered. </span>
<span class='v MK3_2' data-id='MK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_3' data-id='MK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He said to the man who had his hand withered, <span class='wj'>“Stand up.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_4' data-id='MK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> But they were silent. </span>
<span class='v MK3_5' data-id='MK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.” </span> He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. </span>
<span class='v MK3_6' data-id='MK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. </span></div>

<span class='v MK3_7' data-id='MK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea, </span>
<span class='v MK3_8' data-id='MK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_9' data-id='MK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_10' data-id='MK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_11' data-id='MK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!” </span>

<span class='v MK3_22' data-id='MK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_23' data-id='MK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He summoned them, and said to them in parables, <span class='wj'>“How can Satan cast out Satan? </span> </span>

<span class='v MK3_29' data-id='MK3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-786'><a href='#note-786' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
