<span class='v T11_3' data-id='T11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine, </span>
<span class='v T11_4' data-id='T11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith— </span>
<span class='v T11_5' data-id='T11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith, </span>
<span class='v T11_6' data-id='T11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned away to vain talking, </span>
<span class='v T11_7' data-id='T11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm. </span>
<span class='v T11_8' data-id='T11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But we know that the law is good, if a person uses it lawfully, </span>
<span class='v T11_9' data-id='T11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, </span>
<span class='v T11_10' data-id='T11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine, </span>

<span class='v T11_13' data-id='T11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>although I used to be a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. </span>
<span class='v T11_14' data-id='T11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T11_15' data-id='T11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief. </span>
<span class='v T11_16' data-id='T11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life. </span>
<span class='v T11_17' data-id='T11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
