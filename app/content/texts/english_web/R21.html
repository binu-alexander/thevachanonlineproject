<span class='v R21_2' data-id='R21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers’ households. </span>
<span class='v R21_3' data-id='R21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for God’s Tent of Meeting was there, which Yahweh’s servant Moses had made in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v R21_4' data-id='R21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But David had brought God’s ark up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R21_5' data-id='R21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Moreover the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before Yahweh’s tabernacle; and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there. </span>
<span class='v R21_6' data-id='R21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it. </span></div>

<span class='v R21_8' data-id='R21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Solomon said to God, “You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place. </span>
<span class='v R21_9' data-id='R21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. </span>
<span class='v R21_10' data-id='R21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this great people of yours?” </span></div>

<span class='v R21_11' data-id='R21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, nor yet have you asked for long life; but have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king, </span>
<span class='v R21_12' data-id='R21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>therefore wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you had, and none after you will have.” </span></div>
