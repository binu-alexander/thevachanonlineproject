<span class='v JR52_1' data-id='JR52_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_2' data-id='JR52_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </span>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For through Yahweh’s anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'>Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR52_4' data-id='JR52_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it round about. </span>
<span class='v JR52_5' data-id='JR52_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. </span></div>

<span class='v JR52_6' data-id='JR52_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. </span>
<span class='v JR52_7' data-id='JR52_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of war went toward the Arabah, </span>
<span class='v JR52_8' data-id='JR52_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. </span>
<span class='v JR52_9' data-id='JR52_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment on him. </span>
<span class='v JR52_10' data-id='JR52_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_11' data-id='JR52_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day of his death. </span></div>
