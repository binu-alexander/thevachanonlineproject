<span class='v C12_2' data-id='C12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified. </span>
<span class='v C12_3' data-id='C12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling. </span>
<span class='v C12_4' data-id='C12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, </span>
<span class='v C12_5' data-id='C12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. </span></div>

<span class='v C12_6' data-id='C12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We speak wisdom, however, among those who are full grown, yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the rulers of this world who are coming to nothing. </span>
<span class='v C12_7' data-id='C12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds for our glory, </span>
<span class='v C12_8' data-id='C12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>which none of the rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory. </span>

<span class='v C12_10' data-id='C12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But to us, God revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. </span>
<span class='v C12_11' data-id='C12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man, which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God, except God’s Spirit. </span>
<span class='v C12_12' data-id='C12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But we received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things that were freely given to us by God. </span>
<span class='v C12_13' data-id='C12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. </span>
<span class='v C12_14' data-id='C12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now the natural man doesn’t receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him, and he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned. </span>
<span class='v C12_15' data-id='C12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But he who is spiritual discerns all things, and he himself is judged by no one. </span>
