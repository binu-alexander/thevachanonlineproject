<span class='v T24_1' data-id='T24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: </span>
<span class='v T24_2' data-id='T24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. </span>
<span class='v T24_3' data-id='T24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, </span>
<span class='v T24_4' data-id='T24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. </span>
<span class='v T24_5' data-id='T24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_6' data-id='T24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. </span>
<span class='v T24_7' data-id='T24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. </span>
<span class='v T24_8' data-id='T24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_9' data-id='T24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come to me soon, </span>
<span class='v T24_10' data-id='T24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. </span>
<span class='v T24_11' data-id='T24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. </span>
<span class='v T24_12' data-id='T24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. </span>
<span class='v T24_13' data-id='T24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come, and the books, especially the parchments. </span>
<span class='v T24_14' data-id='T24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds, </span>
<span class='v T24_15' data-id='T24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>of whom you also must beware; for he greatly opposed our words. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_16' data-id='T24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. </span>
<span class='v T24_17' data-id='T24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. </span>
<span class='v T24_18' data-id='T24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>

<span class='v T24_21' data-id='T24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_22' data-id='T24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. </span></div></div>
