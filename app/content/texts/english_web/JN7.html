<span class='v JN7_1' data-id='JN7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him. </span>
<span class='v JN7_2' data-id='JN7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. </span>
<span class='v JN7_3' data-id='JN7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do. </span>
<span class='v JN7_4' data-id='JN7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_5' data-id='JN7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For even his brothers didn’t believe in him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_6' data-id='JN7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class='wj'>“My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_7' data-id='JN7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_8' data-id='JN7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_9' data-id='JN7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee. </span>
<span class='v JN7_10' data-id='JN7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret. </span>
<span class='v JN7_11' data-id='JN7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_12' data-id='JN7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_13' data-id='JN7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews. </span>
<span class='v JN7_14' data-id='JN7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. </span>
<span class='v JN7_15' data-id='JN7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_16' data-id='JN7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore answered them, <span class='wj'>“My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_17' data-id='JN7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_18' data-id='JN7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_19' data-id='JN7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_20' data-id='JN7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_21' data-id='JN7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“I did one work and you all marvel because of it. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_22' data-id='JN7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_23' data-id='JN7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_24' data-id='JN7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_25' data-id='JN7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? </span>
<span class='v JN7_26' data-id='JN7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ? </span>
<span class='v JN7_27' data-id='JN7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_28' data-id='JN7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, <span class='wj'>“You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_29' data-id='JN7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_30' data-id='JN7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. </span>
<span class='v JN7_31' data-id='JN7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_32' data-id='JN7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_33' data-id='JN7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_34' data-id='JN7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You will seek me, and won’t find me. You can’t come where I am.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_35' data-id='JN7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? </span>
<span class='v JN7_36' data-id='JN7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>What is this word that he said, <span class='wj'>‘You will seek me, and won’t find me;’</span> and <span class='wj'>‘Where I am, you can’t come’</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_37' data-id='JN7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, <span class='wj'>“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink! </span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_38' data-id='JN7_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_39' data-id='JN7_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_40' data-id='JN7_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_41' data-id='JN7_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? </span>
<span class='v JN7_42' data-id='JN7_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the offspring<span class='note' id='footnote-936'><a href='#note-936' class='key'>*</a></span> of David, <span class='note' id='footnote-937'><a href='#note-937' class='key'>✡</a></span> and from Bethlehem,<span class='note' id='footnote-938'><a href='#note-938' class='key'>✡</a></span> the village where David was?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_43' data-id='JN7_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>So a division arose in the multitude because of him. </span>
<span class='v JN7_44' data-id='JN7_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. </span>
<span class='v JN7_45' data-id='JN7_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_46' data-id='JN7_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_47' data-id='JN7_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? </span>
<span class='v JN7_48' data-id='JN7_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees? </span>
<span class='v JN7_49' data-id='JN7_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_50' data-id='JN7_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them, </span>
<span class='v JN7_51' data-id='JN7_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>“Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_52' data-id='JN7_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”<span class='note' id='footnote-939'><a href='#note-939' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
