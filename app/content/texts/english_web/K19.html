<span class='v K19_2' data-id='K19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. </span>
<span class='v K19_3' data-id='K19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to him, “I have heard your prayer and your supplication, that you have made before me. I have made this house holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually. </span>
<span class='v K19_4' data-id='K19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes and my ordinances; </span>
<span class='v K19_5' data-id='K19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man on the throne of Israel.’ </span>
<span class='v K19_6' data-id='K19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if you turn away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them; </span>
<span class='v K19_7' data-id='K19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword among all peoples. </span>
<span class='v K19_8' data-id='K19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Though this house is so high, yet everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will say, ‘Why has Yahweh done this to this land, and to this house?’ </span>
<span class='v K19_9' data-id='K19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and they will answer, ‘Because they abandoned Yahweh their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and embraced other gods, and worshiped them, and served them. Therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.’ ” </span></div>
