<span class='v MK1_16' data-id='MK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class='v MK1_17' data-id='MK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_18' data-id='MK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_19' data-id='MK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets. </span>
<span class='v MK1_20' data-id='MK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_21' data-id='MK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. </span>
<span class='v MK1_22' data-id='MK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. </span>
<span class='v MK1_23' data-id='MK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, </span>
<span class='v MK1_24' data-id='MK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_25' data-id='MK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus rebuked him, saying, <span class='wj'>“Be quiet, and come out of him!” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_26' data-id='MK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_27' data-id='MK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!” </span>
<span class='v MK1_28' data-id='MK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_29' data-id='MK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. </span>
<span class='v MK1_30' data-id='MK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. </span>
<span class='v MK1_31' data-id='MK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her immediately,<span class='note' id='footnote-785'><a href='#note-785' class='key'>§</a></span> and she served them. </span>
<span class='v MK1_32' data-id='MK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed by demons. </span>
<span class='v MK1_33' data-id='MK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>All the city was gathered together at the door. </span>
<span class='v MK1_34' data-id='MK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn’t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_35' data-id='MK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, while it was still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place, and prayed there. </span>
<span class='v MK1_36' data-id='MK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Simon and those who were with him searched for him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_37' data-id='MK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_38' data-id='MK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Let’s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_39' data-id='MK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_40' data-id='MK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_41' data-id='MK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, <span class='wj'>“I want to. Be made clean.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_42' data-id='MK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. </span>
<span class='v MK1_43' data-id='MK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out, </span>
<span class='v MK1_44' data-id='MK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>and said to him, <span class='wj'>“See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_45' data-id='MK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People came to him from everywhere. </span></div></div>
