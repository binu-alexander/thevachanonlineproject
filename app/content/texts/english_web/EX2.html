<span class='v EX2_2' data-id='EX2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him three months. </span>
<span class='v EX2_3' data-id='EX2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river’s bank. </span>
<span class='v EX2_4' data-id='EX2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. </span>
<span class='v EX2_5' data-id='EX2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. </span>
<span class='v EX2_6' data-id='EX2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX2_7' data-id='EX2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX2_8' data-id='EX2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” </span></div>

<span class='v EX2_14' data-id='EX2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” </span></div>

<span class='v EX2_15' data-id='EX2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX2_16' data-id='EX2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX2_19' data-id='EX2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They said, “An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX2_20' data-id='EX2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” </span></div>
