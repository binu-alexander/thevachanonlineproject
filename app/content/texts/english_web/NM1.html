Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath. Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he maintains wrath against his enemies. </span>
<span class='v NM1_3' data-id='NM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave the guilty unpunished. Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet. </span>
<span class='v NM1_4' data-id='NM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers. Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes. </span>
