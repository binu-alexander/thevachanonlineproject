<span class='v IS7_1' data-id='IS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it. </span>
<span class='v IS7_2' data-id='IS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>David’s house was told, “Syria is allied with Ephraim.” His heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_3' data-id='IS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shearjashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the highway of the fuller’s field. </span>
<span class='v IS7_4' data-id='IS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Tell him, ‘Be careful, and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. </span>
<span class='v IS7_5' data-id='IS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil against you, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS7_6' data-id='IS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Let’s go up against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it among ourselves, and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” </span>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord Yahweh says: “It shall not stand, neither shall it happen.” </span>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it shall not be a people. </span>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_10' data-id='IS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying, </span>

<span class='v IS7_14' data-id='IS7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin will conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.<span class='note' id='footnote-487'><a href='#note-487' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>

<span class='v IS7_24' data-id='IS7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>People will go there with arrows and with bow, because all the land will be briers and thorns. </span>
