<span class='v H15_1' data-id='H15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you. </span>
<span class='v H15_2' data-id='H15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. </span>
<span class='v H15_3' data-id='H15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape. </span>
<span class='v H15_4' data-id='H15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief. </span>
<span class='v H15_5' data-id='H15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You are all children of light and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness, </span>
<span class='v H15_6' data-id='H15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober. </span>

<span class='v H15_8' data-id='H15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But since we belong to the day, let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation. </span>
<span class='v H15_9' data-id='H15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v H15_10' data-id='H15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. </span>
