<span class='v JM4_1' data-id='JM4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Where do wars and fightings among you come from? Don’t they come from your pleasures that war in your members? </span>
<span class='v JM4_2' data-id='JM4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You lust, and don’t have. You murder and covet, and can’t obtain. You fight and make war. You don’t have, because you don’t ask. </span>
<span class='v JM4_3' data-id='JM4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You ask, and don’t receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. </span>
<span class='v JM4_4' data-id='JM4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You adulterers and adulteresses, don’t you know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. </span>
<span class='v JM4_5' data-id='JM4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who lives in us yearns jealously”? </span>
<span class='v JM4_6' data-id='JM4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1318'><a href='#note-1318' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v JM4_7' data-id='JM4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. </span>
<span class='v JM4_8' data-id='JM4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. </span>
<span class='v JM4_9' data-id='JM4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Lament, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloom. </span>
<span class='v JM4_10' data-id='JM4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM4_11' data-id='JM4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Don’t speak against one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother and judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge. </span>
<span class='v JM4_12' data-id='JM4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Only one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge another? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM4_13' data-id='JM4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow let’s go into this city, and spend a year there, trade, and make a profit.” </span>
<span class='v JM4_14' data-id='JM4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Whereas you don’t know what your life will be like tomorrow. For what is your life? For you are a vapor that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away. </span>
<span class='v JM4_15' data-id='JM4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.” </span>
<span class='v JM4_16' data-id='JM4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But now you glory in your boasting. All such boasting is evil. </span>
<span class='v JM4_17' data-id='JM4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>To him therefore who knows to do good, and doesn’t do it, to him it is sin. </span></div></div>
