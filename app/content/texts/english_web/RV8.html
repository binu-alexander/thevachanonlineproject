<span class='v RV8_3' data-id='RV8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV8_4' data-id='RV8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel’s hand. </span>

<span class='v RV8_8' data-id='RV8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood, </span>

<span class='v RV8_11' data-id='RV8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter. </span></div>
