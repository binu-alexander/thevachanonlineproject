<span class='v MK15_2' data-id='MK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_2' data-id='MK15_2'>He answered, <span class='wj'>“So you say.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MK15_4' data-id='MK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_5' data-id='MK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled. </span></div>

<span class='v MK15_6' data-id='MK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_7' data-id='MK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There was one called Barabbas, bound with his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder. </span>
<span class='v MK15_8' data-id='MK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them. </span>
<span class='v MK15_9' data-id='MK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?” </span>
<span class='v MK15_10' data-id='MK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up. </span>
<span class='v MK15_11' data-id='MK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead. </span>
<span class='v MK15_12' data-id='MK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_13' data-id='MK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They cried out again, “Crucify him!” </span></div>

<span class='v MK15_19' data-id='MK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_20' data-id='MK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_21' data-id='MK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross. </span>
<span class='v MK15_22' data-id='MK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.” </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_31' data-id='MK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself. </span>
