<span class='v JG12_5' data-id='JG12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me go over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No;” </span>
<span class='v JG12_6' data-id='JG12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>then they said to him, “Now say ‘Shibboleth;’ ” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage to pronounce it correctly, then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell. </span></div>
