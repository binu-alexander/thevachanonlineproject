<span class='v R115_1' data-id='R115_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David made himself houses in David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent for it. </span>
<span class='v R115_2' data-id='R115_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then David said, “No one ought to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For Yahweh has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to minister to him forever.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R115_3' data-id='R115_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up Yahweh’s ark to its place, which he had prepared for it. </span>
<span class='v R115_4' data-id='R115_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites: </span>
<span class='v R115_5' data-id='R115_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty; </span>

<span class='v R115_11' data-id='R115_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, </span>
<span class='v R115_12' data-id='R115_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites.

<span class='v R115_13' data-id='R115_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For because you didn’t carry it at first, Yahweh our God broke out in anger against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R115_14' data-id='R115_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R115_15' data-id='R115_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The children of the Levites bore God’s ark on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to Yahweh’s word. </span>

<span class='v R115_19' data-id='R115_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud; </span>
<span class='v R115_20' data-id='R115_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to Alamoth; </span>
<span class='v R115_21' data-id='R115_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the eight-stringed lyre, to lead. </span>
<span class='v R115_22' data-id='R115_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the singers, because he was skillful. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R115_25' data-id='R115_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up out of the house of Obed-Edom with joy. </span>
<span class='v R115_26' data-id='R115_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When God helped the Levites who bore the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. </span>
<span class='v R115_27' data-id='R115_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had an ephod of linen on him. </span>
<span class='v R115_28' data-id='R115_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Thus all Israel brought the ark of Yahweh’s covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. </span>
<span class='v R115_29' data-id='R115_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As the ark of Yahweh’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart. </span></div></div>
