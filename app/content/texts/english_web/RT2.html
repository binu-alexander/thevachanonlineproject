<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_1' data-id='RT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Naomi had a relative of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz. </span>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I find favor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'>She said to her, “Go, my daughter.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_3' data-id='RT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_4' data-id='RT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, “May Yahweh be with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_4' data-id='RT2_4'>They answered him, “May Yahweh bless you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_5' data-id='RT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, “Whose young lady is this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_6' data-id='RT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, “It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab. </span>
<span class='v RT2_7' data-id='RT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she rested a little in the house.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_8' data-id='RT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to glean in another field, and don’t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens. </span>
<span class='v RT2_9' data-id='RT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven’t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_10' data-id='RT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_11' data-id='RT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Boaz answered her, “I have been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father, your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn’t know before. </span>
<span class='v RT2_12' data-id='RT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given to you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_13' data-id='RT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not as one of your servants.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_14' data-id='RT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At meal time Boaz said to her, “Come here, and eat some bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_14' data-id='RT2_14'>She sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain. She ate, was satisfied, and left some of it. </span>
<span class='v RT2_15' data-id='RT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don’t reproach her. </span>
<span class='v RT2_16' data-id='RT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it. Let her glean, and don’t rebuke her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_17' data-id='RT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah<span class='note' id='footnote-215'><a href='#note-215' class='key'>*</a></span> of barley. </span>
<span class='v RT2_18' data-id='RT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>She took it up, and went into the city. Then her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she had enough. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'>She told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, “The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_20' data-id='RT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed by Yahweh, who has not abandoned his kindness to the living and to the dead.” Naomi said to her, “The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_21' data-id='RT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Ruth the Moabitess said, “Yes, he said to me, ‘You shall stay close to my young men until they have finished all my harvest.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_22' data-id='RT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_23' data-id='RT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law. </span></div></div>
