<span class='v JS17_1' data-id='JS17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. As for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. </span>
<span class='v JS17_2' data-id='JS17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So this was for the rest of the children of Manasseh according to their families: for the children of Abiezer, for the children of Helek, for the children of Asriel, for the children of Shechem, for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida. These were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families. </span>
<span class='v JS17_3' data-id='JS17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. </span>
<span class='v JS17_4' data-id='JS17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They came to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the princes, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” Therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. </span>
<span class='v JS17_5' data-id='JS17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Ten parts fell to Manasseh, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; </span>
<span class='v JS17_6' data-id='JS17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh. </span>
<span class='v JS17_7' data-id='JS17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is before Shechem. The border went along to the right hand, to the inhabitants of En Tappuah. </span>
<span class='v JS17_8' data-id='JS17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim. </span>
<span class='v JS17_9' data-id='JS17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook, and ended at the sea. </span>
<span class='v JS17_10' data-id='JS17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s, and the sea was his border. They reached to Asher on the north, and to Issachar on the east. </span>
<span class='v JS17_11' data-id='JS17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Manasseh had three heights in Issachar, in Asher Beth Shean and its towns, and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns. </span>
<span class='v JS17_12' data-id='JS17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Yet the children of Manasseh couldn’t drive out the inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS17_13' data-id='JS17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When the children of Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn’t utterly drive them out. </span>
<span class='v JS17_14' data-id='JS17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance, since we are a numerous people, because Yahweh has blessed us so far?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS17_15' data-id='JS17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to them, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest, and clear land for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS17_16' data-id='JS17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The children of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us. All the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Beth Shean and its towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS17_17' data-id='JS17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, that is, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You are a numerous people, and have great power. You shall not have one lot only; </span>
<span class='v JS17_18' data-id='JS17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>but the hill country shall be yours. Although it is a forest, you shall cut it down, and it’s farthest extent shall be yours; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have chariots of iron, and though they are strong.” </span></div></div>
