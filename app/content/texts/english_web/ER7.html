<span class='v ER7_6' data-id='ER7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his request, according to Yahweh his God’s hand on him. </span>

<span class='v ER7_23' data-id='ER7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? </span></div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class='v ER7_24' data-id='ER7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or laborers of this house of God. </span></div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class='v ER7_25' data-id='ER7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>You, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, who all know the laws of your God; and teach him who doesn’t know them. </span>
