<span class='v MT16_1' data-id='MT16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing him, asked him to show them a sign from heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT16_2' data-id='MT16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, <span class='wj'>“When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_3' data-id='MT16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In the morning, ‘It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the appearance of the sky, but you can’t discern the signs of the times! </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_4' data-id='MT16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it, except the sign of the prophet Jonah.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_4' data-id='MT16_4'>He left them, and departed. </span>
<span class='v MT16_5' data-id='MT16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The disciples came to the other side and had forgotten to take bread. </span>
<span class='v MT16_6' data-id='MT16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_7' data-id='MT16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They reasoned among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_8' data-id='MT16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus, perceiving it, said, <span class='wj'>“Why do you reason among yourselves, you of little faith, ‘because you have brought no bread?’ </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_9' data-id='MT16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Don’t you yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_10' data-id='MT16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_11' data-id='MT16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>How is it that you don’t perceive that I didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_12' data-id='MT16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they understood that he didn’t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_13' data-id='MT16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, <span class='wj'>“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_14' data-id='MT16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They said, “Some say John the Baptizer, some, Elijah, and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_15' data-id='MT16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“But who do you say that I am?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_16' data-id='MT16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_17' data-id='MT16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_18' data-id='MT16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I also tell you that you are Peter,</span><span class='note' id='footnote-712'><a href='#note-712' class='key'>*</a></span> <span class='wj'>and on this rock </span><span class='note' id='footnote-713'><a href='#note-713' class='key'>†</a></span> <span class='wj'>I will build my assembly, and the gates of Hades</span><span class='note' id='footnote-714'><a href='#note-714' class='key'>‡</a></span> <span class='wj'>will not prevail against it. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_19' data-id='MT16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_20' data-id='MT16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ. </span>
<span class='v MT16_21' data-id='MT16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_22' data-id='MT16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Peter took him aside, and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This will never be done to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_23' data-id='MT16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he turned, and said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_24' data-id='MT16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_25' data-id='MT16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, and whoever will lose his life for my sake will find it. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_26' data-id='MT16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For what will it profit a man, if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_27' data-id='MT16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he will render to everyone according to his deeds. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_28' data-id='MT16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom.” </span> </span></div></div>
