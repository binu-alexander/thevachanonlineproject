<span class='v S124_1' data-id='S124_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Saul had returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.” </span>
<span class='v S124_2' data-id='S124_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats. </span>
<span class='v S124_3' data-id='S124_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were staying in the innermost parts of the cave. </span>
<span class='v S124_4' data-id='S124_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>David’s men said to him, “Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’ ” Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe secretly. </span>
<span class='v S124_5' data-id='S124_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Afterward, David’s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul’s skirt. </span>
<span class='v S124_6' data-id='S124_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to his men, “Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh’s anointed, to stretch out my hand against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed.” </span>
<span class='v S124_7' data-id='S124_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So David checked his men with these words, and didn’t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way. </span>
<span class='v S124_8' data-id='S124_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_8' data-id='S124_8'>When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect. </span>
<span class='v S124_9' data-id='S124_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to men’s words, saying, ‘Behold, David seeks to harm you?’ </span>
<span class='v S124_10' data-id='S124_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Behold, today your eyes have seen how Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not stretch out my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh’s anointed. </span>
<span class='v S124_11' data-id='S124_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn’t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it. </span>
<span class='v S124_12' data-id='S124_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you. </span>
<span class='v S124_13' data-id='S124_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness;’ but my hand will not be on you. </span>
<span class='v S124_14' data-id='S124_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea? </span>
<span class='v S124_15' data-id='S124_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_16' data-id='S124_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>It came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. </span>
<span class='v S124_17' data-id='S124_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He said to David, “You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you. </span>
<span class='v S124_18' data-id='S124_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>You have declared today how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn’t kill me. </span>
<span class='v S124_19' data-id='S124_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me today. </span>
<span class='v S124_20' data-id='S124_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now, behold, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. </span>
<span class='v S124_21' data-id='S124_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father’s house.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_22' data-id='S124_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>David swore to Saul. Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </span></div></div>
