<span class='v AC7_5' data-id='AC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. He promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his offspring after him, when he still had no child. </span>
<span class='v AC7_6' data-id='AC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>God spoke in this way: that his offspring would live as aliens in a strange land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years. </span>
