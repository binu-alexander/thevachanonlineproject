<span class='v JN16_2' data-id='JN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They will put you out of the synagogues. Yes, the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God. </span> </span>

<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember that I told you about them. I didn’t tell you these things from the beginning, because I was with you. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_5' data-id='JN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ </span> </span>

<span class='v JN16_7' data-id='JN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I don’t go away, the Counselor won’t come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_8' data-id='JN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When he has come, he will convict the world about sin, about righteousness, and about judgment; </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_9' data-id='JN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>about sin, because they don’t believe in me; </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_10' data-id='JN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>about righteousness, because I am going to my Father, and you won’t see me any more; </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_11' data-id='JN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>about judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged. </span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_16' data-id='JN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A little while, and you will not see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_17' data-id='JN16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Some of his disciples therefore said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, <span class='wj'>‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’</span> and, <span class='wj'>‘Because I go to the Father’</span>?” </span>
<span class='v JN16_18' data-id='JN16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They said therefore, “What is this that he says, <span class='wj'>‘A little while’</span>? We don’t know what he is saying.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_19' data-id='JN16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’ </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_20' data-id='JN16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_21' data-id='JN16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come.

<span class='v JN16_22' data-id='JN16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_25' data-id='JN16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_26' data-id='JN16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In that day you will ask in my name; and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_27' data-id='JN16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_28' data-id='JN16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I came from the Father, and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_29' data-id='JN16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>His disciples said to him, “Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech. </span>
<span class='v JN16_30' data-id='JN16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now we know that you know all things, and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_31' data-id='JN16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Do you now believe? </span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_32' data-id='JN16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Behold, the time is coming, yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own place, and you will leave me alone.

<span class='v JN16_33' data-id='JN16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have told you these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.” </span> </span></div></div>
