<span class='v JS20_2' data-id='JS20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Assign the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses, </span>
<span class='v JS20_3' data-id='JS20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>that the man slayer who kills any person accidentally or unintentionally may flee there. They shall be to you for a refuge from the avenger of blood. </span>
<span class='v JS20_4' data-id='JS20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his case in the ears of the elders of that city. They shall take him into the city with them, and give him a place, that he may live among them. </span>
<span class='v JS20_5' data-id='JS20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If the avenger of blood pursues him, then they shall not deliver up the man slayer into his hand; because he struck his neighbor unintentionally, and didn’t hate him before. </span>
<span class='v JS20_6' data-id='JS20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days.

<span class='v JS20_9' data-id='JS20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>These were the appointed cities for all the children of Israel, and for the alien who lives among them, that whoever kills any person unintentionally might flee there, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stands trial before the congregation. </span></div></div>
