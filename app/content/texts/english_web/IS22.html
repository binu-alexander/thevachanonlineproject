<span class='v IS22_2' data-id='IS22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle. </span>
<span class='v IS22_3' data-id='IS22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All your rulers fled away together. They were bound by the archers. All who were found by you were bound together. They fled far away. </span>
<span class='v IS22_4' data-id='IS22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Therefore I said, “Look away from me. I will weep bitterly. Don’t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </span></div>

<span class='v IS22_5' data-id='IS22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, in the valley of vision, a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.” </span>
<span class='v IS22_6' data-id='IS22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Elam carried his quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield. </span>

<span class='v IS22_12' data-id='IS22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In that day, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, called to weeping, to mourning, to baldness, and to dressing in sackcloth; </span>
<span class='v IS22_13' data-id='IS22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and behold, joy and gladness, killing cattle and killing sheep, eating meat and drinking wine: “Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.” </span>
<span class='v IS22_14' data-id='IS22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears, “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies. </span></div>

<span class='v IS22_16' data-id='IS22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>‘What are you doing here? Who has you here, that you have dug out a tomb here?’ Cutting himself out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!” </span>
<span class='v IS22_17' data-id='IS22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Behold, Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently. Yes, he will grasp you firmly. </span>
<span class='v IS22_18' data-id='IS22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He will surely wind you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a large country. There you will die, and there the chariots of your glory will be, you shame of your lord’s house. </span>

<span class='v IS22_21' data-id='IS22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt. I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. </span>
