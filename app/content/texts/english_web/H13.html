<span class='v H13_1' data-id='H13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore when we couldn’t stand it any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone, </span>
<span class='v H13_2' data-id='H13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith, </span>
<span class='v H13_3' data-id='H13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>that no one would be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed to this task. </span>
<span class='v H13_4' data-id='H13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For most certainly, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction, even as it happened, and you know. </span>
<span class='v H13_5' data-id='H13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this cause I also, when I couldn’t stand it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor would have been in vain. </span>
<span class='v H13_6' data-id='H13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when Timothy came just now to us from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long to see you, </span>
<span class='v H13_7' data-id='H13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>for this cause, brothers, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith. </span>
