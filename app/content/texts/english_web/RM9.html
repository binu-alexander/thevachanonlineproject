<span class='v RM9_1' data-id='RM9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit </span>
<span class='v RM9_2' data-id='RM9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart. </span>
<span class='v RM9_3' data-id='RM9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh </span>
<span class='v RM9_4' data-id='RM9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises; </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_6' data-id='RM9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel that are of Israel. </span>
<span class='v RM9_7' data-id='RM9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Neither, because they are Abraham’s offspring, are they all children. But, “your offspring will be accounted as from Isaac.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1096'><a href='#note-1096' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_8' data-id='RM9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as heirs. </span>
<span class='v RM9_9' data-id='RM9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1097'><a href='#note-1097' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_10' data-id='RM9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Not only so, but Rebekah also conceived by one, by our father Isaac. </span>
<span class='v RM9_11' data-id='RM9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,<span class='note' id='footnote-1098'><a href='#note-1098' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_12' data-id='RM9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1099'><a href='#note-1099' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_13' data-id='RM9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1100'><a href='#note-1100' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_14' data-id='RM9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be! </span>
<span class='v RM9_15' data-id='RM9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1101'><a href='#note-1101' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_16' data-id='RM9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy. </span>
<span class='v RM9_17' data-id='RM9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1102'><a href='#note-1102' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_19' data-id='RM9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?” </span>
<span class='v RM9_20' data-id='RM9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”<span class='note' id='footnote-1103'><a href='#note-1103' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v RM9_21' data-id='RM9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor? </span>
<span class='v RM9_22' data-id='RM9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>What if God, willing to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, </span>
<span class='v RM9_23' data-id='RM9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory, </span>

<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As Isaiah has said before, </span></div>

<span class='v RM9_31' data-id='RM9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM9_32' data-id='RM9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone; </span>
