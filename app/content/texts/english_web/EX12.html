<span class='v EX12_4' data-id='EX12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls.

<span class='v EX12_33' data-id='EX12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.” </span>
