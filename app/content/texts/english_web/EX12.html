<span class='v EX12_4' data-id='EX12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and if the household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls.

<span class='v EX12_5' data-id='EX12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Your lamb shall be without defect, a male a year old. You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats. </span>

<span class='v EX12_11' data-id='EX12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste: it is Yahweh’s Passover. </span>
<span class='v EX12_12' data-id='EX12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal. I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh. </span>

<span class='v EX12_23' data-id='EX12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you. </span>
<span class='v EX12_24' data-id='EX12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever. </span>

<span class='v EX12_33' data-id='EX12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We are all dead men.” </span>

<span class='v EX12_39' data-id='EX12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and they had not prepared any food for themselves. </span>
<span class='v EX12_40' data-id='EX12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. </span>
