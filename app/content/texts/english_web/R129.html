<span class='v R129_1' data-id='R129_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God. </span>
<span class='v R129_2' data-id='R129_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; also onyx stones, stones to be set, stones for inlaid work, of various colors, all kinds of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. </span>
<span class='v R129_3' data-id='R129_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In addition, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, </span>
<span class='v R129_4' data-id='R129_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>even three thousand talents of gold,<span class='note' id='footnote-321'><a href='#note-321' class='key'>*</a></span> of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents<span class='note' id='footnote-322'><a href='#note-322' class='key'>†</a></span> of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses; </span>

<span class='v R129_6' data-id='R129_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the princes of the fathers’ households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered willingly; </span>
<span class='v R129_7' data-id='R129_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and they gave for the service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents<span class='note' id='footnote-323'><a href='#note-323' class='key'>‡</a></span> and ten thousand darics,<span class='note' id='footnote-324'><a href='#note-324' class='key'>§</a></span> of silver ten thousand talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred thousand talents. </span>
<span class='v R129_8' data-id='R129_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>People with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of Yahweh’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. </span>

<span class='v R129_12' data-id='R129_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your hand to make great, and to give strength to all! </span>
<span class='v R129_13' data-id='R129_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name. </span>
<span class='v R129_14' data-id='R129_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your own. </span>
<span class='v R129_15' data-id='R129_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we are strangers before you, and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no remaining. </span>

<span class='v R129_20' data-id='R129_20'>All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king. </span>

<span class='v R129_22' data-id='R129_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>and ate and drank before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_23' data-id='R129_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. </span>
<span class='v R129_24' data-id='R129_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>All the princes, the mighty men, and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king. </span>
<span class='v R129_25' data-id='R129_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. </span>
<span class='v R129_26' data-id='R129_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. </span>
