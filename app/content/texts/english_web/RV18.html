<span class='v RV18_1' data-id='RV18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory. </span>
<span class='v RV18_2' data-id='RV18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He cried with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird! </span>
<span class='v RV18_3' data-id='RV18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV18_4' data-id='RV18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don’t receive of her plagues, </span>
<span class='v RV18_5' data-id='RV18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered her iniquities. </span>
<span class='v RV18_6' data-id='RV18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double. </span>
<span class='v RV18_7' data-id='RV18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, ‘I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.’ </span>
<span class='v RV18_8' data-id='RV18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning, and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong. </span>
<span class='v RV18_9' data-id='RV18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived wantonly with her will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of her burning, </span>
<span class='v RV18_10' data-id='RV18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one hour.’ </span>
<span class='v RV18_11' data-id='RV18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise any more: </span>
<span class='v RV18_12' data-id='RV18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble; </span>
<span class='v RV18_13' data-id='RV18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people’s bodies and souls. </span>
<span class='v RV18_14' data-id='RV18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you. All things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you will find them no more at all. </span>
<span class='v RV18_15' data-id='RV18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, </span>
<span class='v RV18_16' data-id='RV18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls! </span>
<span class='v RV18_17' data-id='RV18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.’ Every ship master, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away, </span>
<span class='v RV18_18' data-id='RV18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What is like the great city?’ </span>
<span class='v RV18_19' data-id='RV18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!’ For she is made desolate in one hour. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV18_20' data-id='RV18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her.” </span>
<span class='v RV18_21' data-id='RV18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all. </span>
<span class='v RV18_22' data-id='RV18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you. </span>
<span class='v RV18_23' data-id='RV18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived. </span>
<span class='v RV18_24' data-id='RV18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth.” </span></div></div>
