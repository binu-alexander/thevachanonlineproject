<span class='v LK2_2' data-id='LK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. </span>

<span class='v LK2_7' data-id='LK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. </span>
<span class='v LK2_8' data-id='LK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. </span>

<span class='v LK2_12' data-id='LK2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_13' data-id='LK2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying, </span></div>

<span class='v LK2_43' data-id='LK2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, </span>
<span class='v LK2_44' data-id='LK2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances. </span>
<span class='v LK2_45' data-id='LK2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_46' data-id='LK2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. </span>
