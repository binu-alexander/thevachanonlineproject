<span class='v LK2_2' data-id='LK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This was the first enrollment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria. </span>
<span class='v LK2_3' data-id='LK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All went to enroll themselves, everyone to his own city. </span>
<span class='v LK2_4' data-id='LK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David; </span>

<span class='v LK2_7' data-id='LK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn. </span>
<span class='v LK2_8' data-id='LK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>There were shepherds in the same country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock. </span>

<span class='v LK2_12' data-id='LK2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>This is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_13' data-id='LK2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Suddenly, there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army praising God, and saying, </span></div>

<span class='v LK2_42' data-id='LK2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast, </span>
<span class='v LK2_43' data-id='LK2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother didn’t know it, </span>
<span class='v LK2_44' data-id='LK2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey, and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances. </span>
<span class='v LK2_45' data-id='LK2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When they didn’t find him, they returned to Jerusalem, looking for him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_46' data-id='LK2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. </span>

<span class='v LK2_51' data-id='LK2_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. </span>
