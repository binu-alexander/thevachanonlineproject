<span class='v IS27_2' data-id='IS27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In that day, sing to her, “A pleasant vineyard! </span>
<span class='v IS27_3' data-id='IS27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I, Yahweh, am its keeper. I will water it every moment. Lest anyone damage it, I will keep it night and day. </span>
<span class='v IS27_4' data-id='IS27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Wrath is not in me, but if I should find briers and thorns, I would do battle! I would march on them and I would burn them together. </span>
<span class='v IS27_5' data-id='IS27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me. Let him make peace with me.” </span></div>

<span class='v IS27_9' data-id='IS27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces, so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more. </span>
<span class='v IS27_10' data-id='IS27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness. The calf will feed there, and there he will lie down, and consume its branches. </span>
