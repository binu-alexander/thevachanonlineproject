<span class='v MT15_2' data-id='MT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.” </span></div>

<span class='v MT15_3' data-id='MT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He answered them, <span class='wj'>“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_4' data-id='MT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-709'><a href='#note-709' class='key'>✡</a></span> <span class='wj'>and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-710'><a href='#note-710' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_5' data-id='MT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_6' data-id='MT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_7' data-id='MT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT15_10' data-id='MT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Hear, and understand. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_11' data-id='MT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_12' data-id='MT15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_13' data-id='MT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class='wj'>“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_15' data-id='MT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_16' data-id='MT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Do you also still not understand? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_17' data-id='MT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body? </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_18' data-id='MT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_19' data-id='MT15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT15_20' data-id='MT15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_21' data-id='MT15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MT15_22' data-id='MT15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_23' data-id='MT15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he answered her not a word. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_23' data-id='MT15_23'>His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_24' data-id='MT15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class='wj'>“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_25' data-id='MT15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_26' data-id='MT15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class='wj'>“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_27' data-id='MT15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_28' data-id='MT15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus answered her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_29' data-id='MT15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there. </span>
<span class='v MT15_30' data-id='MT15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them, </span>
<span class='v MT15_31' data-id='MT15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_32' data-id='MT15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class='wj'>“I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_33' data-id='MT15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“How many loaves do you have?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'>They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_35' data-id='MT15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; </span>
<span class='v MT15_36' data-id='MT15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. </span>
<span class='v MT15_37' data-id='MT15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class='v MT15_38' data-id='MT15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children. </span>
<span class='v MT15_39' data-id='MT15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala. </span></div></div>
