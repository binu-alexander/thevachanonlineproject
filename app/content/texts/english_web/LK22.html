<span class='v LK22_2' data-id='LK22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people. </span>
<span class='v LK22_3' data-id='LK22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Satan entered into Judas, who was also called Iscariot, who was counted with the twelve. </span>
<span class='v LK22_4' data-id='LK22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_5' data-id='LK22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They were glad, and agreed to give him money. </span>
<span class='v LK22_6' data-id='LK22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude. </span>
<span class='v LK22_7' data-id='LK22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed. </span>
<span class='v LK22_8' data-id='LK22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span class='wj'>“Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK22_10' data-id='LK22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_11' data-id='LK22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’ </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_13' data-id='LK22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They went, found things as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. </span>
<span class='v LK22_14' data-id='LK22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles. </span>
<span class='v LK22_15' data-id='LK22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer, </span> </span>

<span class='v LK22_17' data-id='LK22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take this, and share it among yourselves, </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_19' data-id='LK22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke, and gave it to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_20' data-id='LK22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, <span class='wj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_21' data-id='LK22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_22' data-id='LK22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_23' data-id='LK22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing. </span>
<span class='v LK22_24' data-id='LK22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>A dispute also arose among them, which of them was considered to be greatest. </span>
<span class='v LK22_25' data-id='LK22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’ </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_26' data-id='LK22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_27' data-id='LK22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am among you as one who serves. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_28' data-id='LK22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But you are those who have continued with me in my trials. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_29' data-id='LK22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me, </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_31' data-id='LK22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class='wj'>“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have all of you, that he might sift you as wheat, </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_32' data-id='LK22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_33' data-id='LK22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_34' data-id='LK22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“When I sent you out without purse, wallet, and sandals, did you lack anything?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'>They said, “Nothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_36' data-id='LK22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_37' data-id='LK22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-908'><a href='#note-908' class='key'>✡</a></span> <span class='wj'>For that which concerns me has an end.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“That is enough.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_39' data-id='LK22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He came out and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_40' data-id='LK22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>When he was at the place, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_41' data-id='LK22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed, </span>
<span class='v LK22_42' data-id='LK22_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class='wj'>“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_43' data-id='LK22_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_44' data-id='LK22_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_45' data-id='LK22_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief, </span>
<span class='v LK22_46' data-id='LK22_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_47' data-id='LK22_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_48' data-id='LK22_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_49' data-id='LK22_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_50' data-id='LK22_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_51' data-id='LK22_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Let me at least do this”</span>—and he touched his ear, and healed him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_52' data-id='LK22_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs? </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_53' data-id='LK22_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_54' data-id='LK22_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance. </span>
<span class='v LK22_55' data-id='LK22_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_56' data-id='LK22_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_57' data-id='LK22_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'>But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_59' data-id='LK22_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_60' data-id='LK22_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. </span>
<span class='v LK22_61' data-id='LK22_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_62' data-id='LK22_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>He went out, and wept bitterly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_63' data-id='LK22_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_64' data-id='LK22_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_65' data-id='LK22_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>They spoke many other things against him, insulting him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_66' data-id='LK22_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying, </span>
<span class='v LK22_67' data-id='LK22_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>“If you are the Christ, tell us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_67' data-id='LK22_67'>But he said to them, <span class='wj'>“If I tell you, you won’t believe, </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_68' data-id='LK22_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_69' data-id='LK22_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_70' data-id='LK22_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” </span></div>
