<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, </span>
<span class='v PM1_2' data-id='PM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: </span>
<span class='v PM1_3' data-id='PM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_4' data-id='PM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, </span>
<span class='v PM1_5' data-id='PM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints, </span>
<span class='v PM1_6' data-id='PM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PM1_7' data-id='PM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_8' data-id='PM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, </span>
<span class='v PM1_9' data-id='PM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>yet for love’s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_10' data-id='PM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus, <span class='note' id='footnote-1250'><a href='#note-1250' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v PM1_11' data-id='PM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_12' data-id='PM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, </span>
<span class='v PM1_13' data-id='PM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. </span>
<span class='v PM1_14' data-id='PM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. </span>
<span class='v PM1_15' data-id='PM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever, </span>
<span class='v PM1_16' data-id='PM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_17' data-id='PM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_18' data-id='PM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account. </span>
<span class='v PM1_19' data-id='PM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). </span>
<span class='v PM1_20' data-id='PM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_21' data-id='PM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_22' data-id='PM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_23' data-id='PM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, </span>
<span class='v PM1_24' data-id='PM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. </span></div>
