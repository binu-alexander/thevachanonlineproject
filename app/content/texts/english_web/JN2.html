<span class='v JN2_7' data-id='JN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Fill the water pots with water.”</span> So they filled them up to the brim. </span>
<span class='v JN2_8' data-id='JN2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.”</span> So they took it. </span>
<span class='v JN2_9' data-id='JN2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom </span>

<span class='v JN2_11' data-id='JN2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_12' data-id='JN2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days. </span>
<span class='v JN2_13' data-id='JN2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>

<span class='v JN2_15' data-id='JN2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables. </span>
<span class='v JN2_16' data-id='JN2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To those who sold the doves, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”</span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_18' data-id='JN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_19' data-id='JN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_20' data-id='JN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?” </span>
<span class='v JN2_21' data-id='JN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But he spoke of the temple of his body. </span>
<span class='v JN2_22' data-id='JN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. </span></div>

<span class='v JN2_23' data-id='JN2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did. </span>
<span class='v JN2_24' data-id='JN2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone, </span>
<span class='v JN2_25' data-id='JN2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and because he didn’t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man. </span></div></div>
