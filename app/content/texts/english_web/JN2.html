<span class='v JN2_7' data-id='JN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Fill the water pots with water.”</span> So they filled them up to the brim. </span>
<span class='v JN2_8' data-id='JN2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast.”</span> So they took it. </span>

<span class='v JN2_11' data-id='JN2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. </span></div>

<span class='v JN2_12' data-id='JN2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they stayed there a few days. </span>
<span class='v JN2_13' data-id='JN2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>

<span class='v JN2_15' data-id='JN2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables. </span>
<span class='v JN2_16' data-id='JN2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To those who sold the doves, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a marketplace!”</span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_18' data-id='JN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore answered him, “What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_19' data-id='JN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN2_20' data-id='JN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said, “It took forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three days?” </span>
<span class='v JN2_21' data-id='JN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But he spoke of the temple of his body. </span>
<span class='v JN2_22' data-id='JN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. </span></div>

<span class='v JN2_24' data-id='JN2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus didn’t entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone, </span>
