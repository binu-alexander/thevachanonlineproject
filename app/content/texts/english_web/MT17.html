<span class='v MT17_1' data-id='MT17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After six days, Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John his brother, and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves. </span>
<span class='v MT17_2' data-id='MT17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He was changed<span class='note' id='footnote-715'><a href='#note-715' class='key'>*</a></span> before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. </span>
<span class='v MT17_3' data-id='MT17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_4' data-id='MT17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Peter answered, and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let’s make three tents here: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_5' data-id='MT17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_6' data-id='MT17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. </span>
<span class='v MT17_7' data-id='MT17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus came and touched them and said, <span class='wj'>“Get up, and don’t be afraid.” </span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_8' data-id='MT17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus alone. </span>
<span class='v MT17_9' data-id='MT17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Don’t tell anyone what you saw, until the Son of Man has risen from the dead.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_10' data-id='MT17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_11' data-id='MT17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things, </span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_12' data-id='MT17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they didn’t recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_13' data-id='MT17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptizer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_14' data-id='MT17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When they came to the multitude, a man came to him, kneeling down to him, and saying, </span>
<span class='v MT17_15' data-id='MT17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is epileptic, and suffers grievously; for he often falls into the fire, and often into the water. </span>
<span class='v MT17_16' data-id='MT17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So I brought him to your disciples, and they could not cure him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_17' data-id='MT17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Faithless and perverse generation! How long will I be with you? How long will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_18' data-id='MT17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Jesus rebuked him, the demon went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_19' data-id='MT17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_20' data-id='MT17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Because of your unbelief. For most certainly I tell you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_21' data-id='MT17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But this kind doesn’t go out except by prayer and fasting.” </span><span class='note' id='footnote-716'><a href='#note-716' class='key'>†</a></span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_22' data-id='MT17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>While they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“The Son of Man is about to be delivered up into the hands of men, </span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_23' data-id='MT17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_23' data-id='MT17_23'>They were exceedingly sorry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_24' data-id='MT17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the didrachma coins<span class='note' id='footnote-717'><a href='#note-717' class='key'>‡</a></span> came to Peter, and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the didrachma?” </span>
<span class='v MT17_25' data-id='MT17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He said, “Yes.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_25' data-id='MT17_25'>When he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, <span class='wj'>“What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive toll or tribute? From their children, or from strangers?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_26' data-id='MT17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, “From strangers.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT17_26' data-id='MT17_26'>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Therefore the children are exempt. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT17_27' data-id='MT17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, lest we cause them to stumble, go to the sea, cast a hook, and take up the first fish that comes up.

<span class='footnote' id='note-717'><span class='key'>‡ </span><a href='#footnote-717' class='backref'>17:24</a> <span class='text'> <span class="ft">A didrachma is a Greek silver coin worth 2 drachmas, about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days’ wages. It was commonly used to pay the half-shekel temple tax, because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver. A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.</span></span></span>
<span class='footnote' id='note-718'><span class='key'>§ </span><a href='#footnote-718' class='backref'>17:27</a> <span class='text'> <span class="ft">A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel: just exactly enough to cover the half-shekel temple tax for two people. A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, usually in the form of a silver coin.</span></span></span>
