<span class='v RV5_1' data-id='RV5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals. </span>
<span class='v RV5_2' data-id='RV5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?” </span>
<span class='v RV5_3' data-id='RV5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book or to look in it. </span>
<span class='v RV5_4' data-id='RV5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look in it. </span>
<span class='v RV5_5' data-id='RV5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and its seven seals.” </span>
<span class='v RV5_6' data-id='RV5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV5_7' data-id='RV5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV5_8' data-id='RV5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </span>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They sang a new song, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>“You are worthy to take the book </span></div>

<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>and bought us for God with your blood </span></div>

<span class='v RV5_10' data-id='RV5_10'>and we will reign on the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_11' data-id='RV5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. The number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands; </span>
<span class='v RV5_12' data-id='RV5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!” </span></div>
