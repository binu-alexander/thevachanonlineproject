<span class='v LK6_1' data-id='LK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now on the second Sabbath after the first, he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands. </span>
<span class='v LK6_2' data-id='LK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But some of the Pharisees said to them, “Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?” </span></div>

<span class='v LK6_3' data-id='LK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus, answering them, said, <span class='wj'>“Haven’t you read what David did when he was hungry, he, and those who were with him; </span> </span>
<span class='v LK6_4' data-id='LK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>how he entered into God’s house, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?”</span> </span>

<span class='v LK6_8' data-id='LK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, <span class='wj'>“Rise up, and stand in the middle.”</span> He arose and stood. </span>
<span class='v LK6_9' data-id='LK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I will ask you something: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK6_10' data-id='LK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He looked around at them all, and said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did, and his hand was restored as sound as the other. </span>
