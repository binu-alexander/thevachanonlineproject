<span class='v MT14_1' data-id='MT14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus, </span>
<span class='v MT14_2' data-id='MT14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptizer. He is risen from the dead. That is why these powers work in him.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_3' data-id='MT14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Herod had arrested John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife. </span>
<span class='v MT14_4' data-id='MT14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For John said to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_5' data-id='MT14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MT14_6' data-id='MT14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced among them and pleased Herod. </span>
<span class='v MT14_7' data-id='MT14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. </span>
<span class='v MT14_8' data-id='MT14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>She, being prompted by her mother, said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptizer.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_9' data-id='MT14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The king was grieved, but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to be given, </span>
<span class='v MT14_10' data-id='MT14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison. </span>
<span class='v MT14_11' data-id='MT14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>His head was brought on a platter, and given to the young lady; and she brought it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MT14_12' data-id='MT14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His disciples came, and took the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT14_13' data-id='MT14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat, to a deserted place apart. When the multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_14' data-id='MT14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus went out, and he saw a great multitude. He had compassion on them, and healed their sick. </span>
<span class='v MT14_15' data-id='MT14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When evening had come, his disciples came to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_16' data-id='MT14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_17' data-id='MT14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They told him, “We only have here five loaves and two fish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_18' data-id='MT14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“Bring them here to me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_19' data-id='MT14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes. </span>
<span class='v MT14_20' data-id='MT14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They all ate, and were filled. They took up twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken pieces. </span>
<span class='v MT14_21' data-id='MT14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_22' data-id='MT14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat, and to go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. </span>
<span class='v MT14_23' data-id='MT14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>After he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. </span>
<span class='v MT14_24' data-id='MT14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. </span>
<span class='v MT14_25' data-id='MT14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the fourth watch of the night,<span class='note' id='footnote-705'><a href='#note-705' class='key'>*</a></span> Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.<span class='note' id='footnote-706'><a href='#note-706' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_26' data-id='MT14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. </span>
<span class='v MT14_27' data-id='MT14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Cheer up!

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_28' data-id='MT14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the waters.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“Come!”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'>Peter stepped down from the boat, and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT14_30' data-id='MT14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But when he saw that the wind was strong, he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_31' data-id='MT14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Immediately Jesus stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, <span class='wj'>“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_32' data-id='MT14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>When they got up into the boat, the wind ceased. </span>
<span class='v MT14_33' data-id='MT14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Those who were in the boat came and worshiped him, saying, “You are truly the Son of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_34' data-id='MT14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret. </span>
<span class='v MT14_35' data-id='MT14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>When the people of that place recognized him, they sent into all that surrounding region, and brought to him all who were sick; </span>
<span class='v MT14_36' data-id='MT14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>and they begged him that they might just touch the fringe<span class='note' id='footnote-708'><a href='#note-708' class='key'>‡</a></span> of his garment. As many as touched it were made whole. </span></div></div>
