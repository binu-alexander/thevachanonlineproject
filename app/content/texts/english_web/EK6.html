<span class='v EK6_1' data-id='EK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK6_2' data-id='EK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy to them, </span>
<span class='v EK6_3' data-id='EK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say, ‘You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places. </span>
<span class='v EK6_4' data-id='EK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken. I will cast down your slain men before your idols. </span>
<span class='v EK6_5' data-id='EK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols. I will scatter your bones around your altars. </span>
<span class='v EK6_6' data-id='EK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. </span>
<span class='v EK6_7' data-id='EK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. </span></div>

<span class='v EK6_9' data-id='EK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. </span>
<span class='v EK6_10' data-id='EK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They will know that I am Yahweh. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.” ’ </span></div>
