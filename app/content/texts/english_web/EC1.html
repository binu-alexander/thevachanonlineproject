<span class='v EC1_2' data-id='EC1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” </span>
<span class='v EC1_3' data-id='EC1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun? </span>
<span class='v EC1_4' data-id='EC1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever. </span>
<span class='v EC1_5' data-id='EC1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises. </span>
<span class='v EC1_6' data-id='EC1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses. </span>
<span class='v EC1_7' data-id='EC1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again. </span>
<span class='v EC1_8' data-id='EC1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. </span>
<span class='v EC1_9' data-id='EC1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC1_10' data-id='EC1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold,<span class='note' id='footnote-469'><a href='#note-469' class='key'>*</a></span> this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us. </span>
<span class='v EC1_11' data-id='EC1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after. </span></div>

<span class='v EC1_12' data-id='EC1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v EC1_13' data-id='EC1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<span class='note' id='footnote-470'><a href='#note-470' class='key'>†</a></span> has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. </span>
<span class='v EC1_14' data-id='EC1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind. </span>
<span class='v EC1_15' data-id='EC1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted. </span>
<span class='v EC1_16' data-id='EC1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.” </span>
<span class='v EC1_17' data-id='EC1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind. </span>
<span class='v EC1_18' data-id='EC1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. </span></div></div>
