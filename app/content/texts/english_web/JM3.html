<span class='v JM3_1' data-id='JM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment. </span>
<span class='v JM3_2' data-id='JM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For we all stumble in many things. Anyone who doesn’t stumble in word is a perfect person, able to bridle the whole body also. </span>
<span class='v JM3_3' data-id='JM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body. </span>
<span class='v JM3_4' data-id='JM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Behold,<span class='note' id='footnote-1316'><a href='#note-1316' class='key'>*</a></span> the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires. </span>
<span class='v JM3_5' data-id='JM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest! </span>
<span class='v JM3_6' data-id='JM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.<span class='note' id='footnote-1317'><a href='#note-1317' class='key'>†</a></span> </span>
<span class='v JM3_7' data-id='JM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and sea creature, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind; </span>
<span class='v JM3_8' data-id='JM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. </span>
<span class='v JM3_9' data-id='JM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men who are made in the image of God. </span>
<span class='v JM3_10' data-id='JM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Out of the same mouth comes blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. </span>
<span class='v JM3_11' data-id='JM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water? </span>
<span class='v JM3_12' data-id='JM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water. </span></div>

<span class='v JM3_13' data-id='JM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom. </span>
<span class='v JM3_14' data-id='JM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth. </span>
<span class='v JM3_15' data-id='JM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic. </span>
<span class='v JM3_16' data-id='JM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed. </span>
<span class='v JM3_17' data-id='JM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. </span>
<span class='v JM3_18' data-id='JM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. </span></div></div>
