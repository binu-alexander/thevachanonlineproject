<span class='v T16_1' data-id='T16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed. </span>
<span class='v T16_2' data-id='T16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Those who have believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather let them serve them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T16_3' data-id='T16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If anyone teaches a different doctrine, and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, </span>
<span class='v T16_4' data-id='T16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>he is conceited, knowing nothing, but obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions, </span>
<span class='v T16_5' data-id='T16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>constant friction of people of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.

<span class='v T16_6' data-id='T16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But godliness with contentment is great gain. </span>
<span class='v T16_7' data-id='T16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For we brought nothing into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out. </span>
<span class='v T16_8' data-id='T16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But having food and clothing, we will be content with that. </span>
<span class='v T16_9' data-id='T16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction. </span>
<span class='v T16_10' data-id='T16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed, and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows. </span></div>

<span class='v T16_11' data-id='T16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But you, man of God, flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness. </span>
<span class='v T16_12' data-id='T16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Fight the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses. </span>
<span class='v T16_13' data-id='T16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I command you before God, who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified the good confession, </span>
<span class='v T16_14' data-id='T16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v T16_15' data-id='T16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>which in its own times he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings, and Lord of lords. </span>

<span class='v T16_18' data-id='T16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to distribute, willing to share; </span>

<span class='v T16_21' data-id='T16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>which some profess, and thus have wandered from the faith. </span></div>
