<span class='v MK16_5' data-id='MK16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed. </span>
<span class='v MK16_6' data-id='MK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! </span>
<span class='v MK16_7' data-id='MK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’ ” </span></div>

<span class='v MK16_14' data-id='MK16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those who had seen him after he had risen. </span>
<span class='v MK16_15' data-id='MK16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go into all the world, and preach the Good News to the whole creation. </span> </span>
