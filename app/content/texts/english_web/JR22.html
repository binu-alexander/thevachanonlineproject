<span class='v JR22_4' data-id='JR22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For if you do this thing indeed, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter in by the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, he, his servants, and his people. </span>
<span class='v JR22_5' data-id='JR22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if you will not hear these words, I swear by myself,” says Yahweh, “that this house will become a desolation.” ’ ” </span></div>
