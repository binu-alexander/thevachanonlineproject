<span class='v ZC3_1' data-id='ZC3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>He showed me Joshua the high priest standing before Yahweh’s angel, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_2' data-id='ZC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Satan, “Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! Yes, Yahweh who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Isn’t this a burning stick plucked out of the fire?” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC3_3' data-id='ZC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_4' data-id='ZC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take the filthy garments off him.” To him he said, “Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you, and I will clothe you with rich clothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC3_5' data-id='ZC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I said, “Let them set a clean turban on his head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC3_5' data-id='ZC3_5'>So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him; and Yahweh’s angel was standing by. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_6' data-id='ZC3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh’s angel protested to Joshua, saying, </span>
<span class='v ZC3_7' data-id='ZC3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Yahweh of Armies says: ‘If you will walk in my ways, and if you will follow my instructions, then you also shall judge my house, and shall also keep my courts, and I will give you a place of access among these who stand by. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_8' data-id='ZC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you; for they are men who are a sign: for, behold, I will bring out my servant, the Branch. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_9' data-id='ZC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For, behold, the stone that I have set before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: behold, I will engrave its engraving,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_10' data-id='ZC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In that day,’ says Yahweh of Armies, ‘you will invite every man his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.’ ” </span></div></div>
