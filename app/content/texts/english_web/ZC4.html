<span class='v ZC4_1' data-id='ZC4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The angel who talked with me came again, and wakened me, as a man who is wakened out of his sleep. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “What do you see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'>I said, “I have seen, and behold, a lamp stand all of gold, with its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps on it; there are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top of it; </span>
<span class='v ZC4_3' data-id='ZC4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side of it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_4' data-id='ZC4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me, saying, “What are these, my lord?” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel who talked with me answered me, “Don’t you know what these are?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'>I said, “No, my lord.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_6' data-id='ZC4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, “This is Yahweh’s word to Zerubbabel, saying, ‘Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says Yahweh of Armies. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_7' data-id='ZC4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you are a plain; and he will bring out the capstone with shouts of ‘Grace, grace, to it!’ ” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC4_8' data-id='ZC4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Moreover Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v ZC4_9' data-id='ZC4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands shall also finish it; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_10' data-id='ZC4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, who despises the day of small things? For these seven shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are Yahweh’s eyes, which run back and forth through the whole earth.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC4_11' data-id='ZC4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lamp stand and on the left side of it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_12' data-id='ZC4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I asked him the second time, “What are these two olive branches, which are beside the two golden spouts, that pour the golden oil out of themselves?” </span></div>
