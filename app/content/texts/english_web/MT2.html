<span class='v MT2_2' data-id='MT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Where is he who is born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_3' data-id='MT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. </span>
<span class='v MT2_4' data-id='MT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked them where the Christ would be born. </span>
<span class='v MT2_5' data-id='MT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is written through the prophet, </span></div>

<span class='v MT2_7' data-id='MT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Herod secretly called the wise men, and learned from them exactly what time the star appeared. </span>
<span class='v MT2_8' data-id='MT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me word, so that I also may come and worship him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_9' data-id='MT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They, having heard the king, went their way; and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the young child was. </span>
<span class='v MT2_10' data-id='MT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy. </span>
<span class='v MT2_11' data-id='MT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They came into the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. </span>
<span class='v MT2_12' data-id='MT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country another way. </span></div>
