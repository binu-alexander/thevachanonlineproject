<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX14_5' data-id='EX14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?” </span>
<span class='v EX14_6' data-id='EX14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He prepared his chariot, and took his army with him; </span>
<span class='v EX14_7' data-id='EX14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with captains over all of them. </span>

<span class='v EX14_11' data-id='EX14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They said to Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out of Egypt? </span>

<span class='v EX14_19' data-id='EX14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind them. </span>
<span class='v EX14_20' data-id='EX14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night. </span></div>

<span class='v EX14_21' data-id='EX14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. </span>
<span class='v EX14_22' data-id='EX14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. </span>
<span class='v EX14_23' data-id='EX14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. </span>
<span class='v EX14_24' data-id='EX14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused the Egyptian army. </span>
<span class='v EX14_25' data-id='EX14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, “Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!” </span></div>

<span class='v EX14_26' data-id='EX14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.” </span>
<span class='v EX14_27' data-id='EX14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea. </span>
<span class='v EX14_28' data-id='EX14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them. </span>
<span class='v EX14_29' data-id='EX14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. </span>
<span class='v EX14_30' data-id='EX14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. </span>
