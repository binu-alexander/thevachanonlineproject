<span class='v GN24_10' data-id='GN24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and departed, having a variety of good things of his master’s with him. He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. </span>
<span class='v GN24_11' data-id='GN24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water. </span>
<span class='v GN24_12' data-id='GN24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He said, “Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham. </span>

<span class='v GN24_16' data-id='GN24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin. No man had known her. She went down to the spring, filled her pitcher, and came up. </span>
<span class='v GN24_17' data-id='GN24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please give me a drink, a little water from your pitcher.” </span></div>

<span class='v GN24_18' data-id='GN24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>She said, “Drink, my lord.” She hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN24_19' data-id='GN24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they have finished drinking.” </span>
<span class='v GN24_20' data-id='GN24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_21' data-id='GN24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not. </span>
<span class='v GN24_22' data-id='GN24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>As the camels had done drinking, the man took a golden ring of half a shekel<span class='note' id='footnote-22'><a href='#note-22' class='key'>*</a></span> weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, </span>
<span class='v GN24_23' data-id='GN24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there room in your father’s house for us to stay?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_24' data-id='GN24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” </span>
<span class='v GN24_25' data-id='GN24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>She said moreover to him, “We have both straw and feed enough, and room to lodge in.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_26' data-id='GN24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh. </span>
<span class='v GN24_27' data-id='GN24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_28' data-id='GN24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The young lady ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. </span>
<span class='v GN24_29' data-id='GN24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. </span>
<span class='v GN24_30' data-id='GN24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring. </span>
<span class='v GN24_31' data-id='GN24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He said, “Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_32' data-id='GN24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. </span>
<span class='v GN24_33' data-id='GN24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN24_33' data-id='GN24_33'>Laban said, “Speak on.” </span></div>

<span class='v GN24_39' data-id='GN24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not follow me?’ </span>
<span class='v GN24_40' data-id='GN24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>He said to me, ‘Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son from my relatives, and of my father’s house. </span>

<span class='v GN24_44' data-id='GN24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>then she tells me, “Drink, and I will also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master’s son.’ </span>
<span class='v GN24_45' data-id='GN24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ </span>
<span class='v GN24_46' data-id='GN24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN24_47' data-id='GN24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands. </span>
<span class='v GN24_48' data-id='GN24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son. </span>
<span class='v GN24_49' data-id='GN24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.” </span></div>

<span class='v GN24_61' data-id='GN24_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his way. </span>
