<span class='v T22_3' data-id='T22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </span>

<span class='v T22_18' data-id='T22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. </span>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,”<span class='note' id='footnote-1247'><a href='#note-1247' class='key'>✡</a></span> and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<span class='note' id='footnote-1248'><a href='#note-1248' class='key'>†</a></span> depart from unrighteousness.” </span>

<span class='v T22_22' data-id='T22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </span>
<span class='v T22_23' data-id='T22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. </span>
<span class='v T22_24' data-id='T22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, </span>
<span class='v T22_25' data-id='T22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, </span>
<span class='v T22_26' data-id='T22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will. </span></div></div>
