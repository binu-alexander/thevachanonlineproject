<span class='v EK33_2' data-id='EK33_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; </span>
<span class='v EK33_3' data-id='EK33_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people; </span>
<span class='v EK33_4' data-id='EK33_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. </span>
<span class='v EK33_5' data-id='EK33_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul. </span>
<span class='v EK33_6' data-id='EK33_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’ </span></div>

<span class='v EK33_7' data-id='EK33_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“So you, son of man: I have set you a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word from my mouth, and give them warnings from me. </span>
<span class='v EK33_8' data-id='EK33_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When I tell the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you will surely die,’ and you don’t speak to warn the wicked from his way; that wicked man will die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at your hand. </span>
<span class='v EK33_9' data-id='EK33_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he doesn’t turn from his way; he will die in his iniquity, but you have delivered your soul. </span></div>
