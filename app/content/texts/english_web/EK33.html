<span class='v EK33_2' data-id='EK33_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them, ‘When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman; </span>
<span class='v EK33_3' data-id='EK33_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blows the trumpet, and warns the people; </span>
<span class='v EK33_4' data-id='EK33_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn’t heed the warning, if the sword comes, and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head. </span>
<span class='v EK33_5' data-id='EK33_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn’t take warning. His blood will be on him; whereas if he had heeded the warning, he would have delivered his soul. </span>
<span class='v EK33_6' data-id='EK33_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn’t blow the trumpet, and the people aren’t warned, and the sword comes, and takes any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.’ </span></div>
