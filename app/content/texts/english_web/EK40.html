<span class='v EK40_1' data-id='EK40_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was struck, in the same day, Yahweh’s hand was on me, and he brought me there. </span>
<span class='v EK40_2' data-id='EK40_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was something like the frame of a city to the south. </span>
<span class='v EK40_3' data-id='EK40_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. </span>
<span class='v EK40_4' data-id='EK40_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for you have been brought here so that I may show them to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK40_5' data-id='EK40_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Behold, there was a wall on the outside of the house all around, and in the man’s hand a measuring reed six cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-538'><a href='#note-538' class='key'>*</a></span> long, of a cubit and a hand width each. So he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK40_6' data-id='EK40_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps. He measured the threshold of the gate, one reed wide; and the other threshold, one reed wide. </span>
<span class='v EK40_7' data-id='EK40_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Every lodge was one reed long and one reed wide. Between the lodges was five cubits. The threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK40_8' data-id='EK40_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed. </span>
<span class='v EK40_9' data-id='EK40_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK40_10' data-id='EK40_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side. The three of them were of one measure. The posts had one measure on this side and on that side. </span>
<span class='v EK40_11' data-id='EK40_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits; </span>
<span class='v EK40_12' data-id='EK40_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and a border before the lodges, one cubit on this side, and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. </span>
<span class='v EK40_13' data-id='EK40_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits, door against door. </span>
<span class='v EK40_14' data-id='EK40_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He also made posts, sixty cubits; and the court reached to the posts, around the gate. </span>

<span class='v EK40_18' data-id='EK40_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement. </span>
