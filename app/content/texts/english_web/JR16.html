<span class='v JR16_2' data-id='JR16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“You shall not take a wife, neither shall you have sons or daughters, in this place.” </span>
<span class='v JR16_3' data-id='JR16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh says concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place, and concerning their mothers who bore them, and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land: </span>
<span class='v JR16_4' data-id='JR16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“They will die grievous deaths. They will not be lamented, neither will they be buried. They will be as dung on the surface of the ground. They will be consumed by the sword and by famine.

<span class='v JR16_5' data-id='JR16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh says, “Don’t enter into the house of mourning. Don’t go to lament. Don’t bemoan them, for I have taken away my peace from this people,” says Yahweh, “even loving kindness and tender mercies. </span>
<span class='v JR16_6' data-id='JR16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Both great and small will die in this land. They will not be buried. Men won’t lament for them, cut themselves, or make themselves bald for them. </span>
<span class='v JR16_7' data-id='JR16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Men won’t break bread for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead. Men won’t give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. </span></div>

<span class='v JR16_10' data-id='JR16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It will happen, when you tell this people all these words, and they ask you, ‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is our iniquity? or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’ </span>
<span class='v JR16_11' data-id='JR16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>then you shall tell them, ‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says Yahweh, ‘and have walked after other gods, have served them, have worshiped them, have forsaken me, and have not kept my law. </span>
<span class='v JR16_12' data-id='JR16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>You have done evil more than your fathers, for behold, you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you don’t listen to me. </span>
