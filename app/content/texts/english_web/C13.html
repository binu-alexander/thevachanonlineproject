<span class='v C13_1' data-id='C13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_2' data-id='C13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now, </span>
<span class='v C13_3' data-id='C13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men? </span>
<span class='v C13_4' data-id='C13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly? </span>
<span class='v C13_5' data-id='C13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him? </span>
<span class='v C13_6' data-id='C13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase. </span>
<span class='v C13_7' data-id='C13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. </span>
<span class='v C13_8' data-id='C13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor. </span>
<span class='v C13_9' data-id='C13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_10' data-id='C13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it. </span>
<span class='v C13_11' data-id='C13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_12' data-id='C13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble, </span>
<span class='v C13_13' data-id='C13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is. </span>
<span class='v C13_14' data-id='C13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward. </span>
<span class='v C13_15' data-id='C13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_16' data-id='C13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you? </span>
<span class='v C13_17' data-id='C13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_18' data-id='C13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. </span>
<span class='v C13_19' data-id='C13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1155'><a href='#note-1155' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v C13_20' data-id='C13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1156'><a href='#note-1156' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v C13_21' data-id='C13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours, </span>
<span class='v C13_22' data-id='C13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours, </span>
<span class='v C13_23' data-id='C13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. </span></div></div>
