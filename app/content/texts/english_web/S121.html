<span class='v S121_1' data-id='S121_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no man with you?” </span>
<span class='v S121_2' data-id='S121_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commanded me to do something, and has said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you. I have sent the young men to a certain place.’ </span>
<span class='v S121_3' data-id='S121_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now therefore what is under your hand? Please give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever is available.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_4' data-id='S121_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The priest answered David, and said, “I have no common bread, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_5' data-id='S121_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>David answered the priest, and said to him, “Truly, women have been kept from us as usual these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was only a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?” </span>
<span class='v S121_6' data-id='S121_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_7' data-id='S121_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul. </span>
<span class='v S121_8' data-id='S121_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>David said to Ahimelech, “Isn’t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_9' data-id='S121_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The priest said, “Behold, the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you would like to take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_9' data-id='S121_9'>David said, “There is none like that. Give it to me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_10' data-id='S121_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. </span>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David the king of the land? Didn’t they sing to one another about him in dances, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'>‘Saul has slain his thousands, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'>and David his ten thousands?’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_12' data-id='S121_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath. </span>
<span class='v S121_13' data-id='S121_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands, and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard. </span>
<span class='v S121_14' data-id='S121_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see the man is insane. Why then have you brought him to me? </span>
<span class='v S121_15' data-id='S121_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Should this fellow come into my house?” </span></div></div>
