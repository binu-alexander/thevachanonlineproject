<span class='v NU11_11' data-id='NU11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? </span>
<span class='v NU11_12' data-id='NU11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’ </span>

<span class='v NU11_26' data-id='NU11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU11_27' data-id='NU11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” </span></div>

<span class='v NU11_30' data-id='NU11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU11_31' data-id='NU11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-141'><a href='#note-141' class='key'>‡</a></span> above the surface of the earth. </span>
<span class='v NU11_32' data-id='NU11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails.
