<span class='v T12_2' data-id='T12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for kings and all who are in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence. </span>
<span class='v T12_3' data-id='T12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, </span>
<span class='v T12_4' data-id='T12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T12_5' data-id='T12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, </span>

<span class='v T12_7' data-id='T12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. </span></div>

<span class='footnote' id='note-1235'><span class='key'>* </span><a href='#footnote-1235' class='backref'>2:9</a> <span class='text'> <span class="ft">The word “just” is inserted here in English to preserve the meaning of the whole original Greek sentence in context. The word for “not” is the negative particle “μη” which denies an expected idea, as opposed to the usual word for “not” (ου) which denies a fact. Thus “μη” in this context is denying an expected idea (that women can be properly dressed without good works).</span></span></span>
