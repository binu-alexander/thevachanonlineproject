<span class='v EK20_5' data-id='EK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says: “In the day when I chose Israel, and swore to the offspring of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, ‘I am Yahweh your God;’ </span>
<span class='v EK20_6' data-id='EK20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>in that day I swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands. </span>
<span class='v EK20_7' data-id='EK20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I said to them, ‘Each of you throw away the abominations of his eyes. Don’t defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’ </span></div>
