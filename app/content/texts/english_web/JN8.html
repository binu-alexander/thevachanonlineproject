<span class='v JN8_2' data-id='JN8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now very early in the morning, he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down and taught them. </span>
<span class='v JN8_3' data-id='JN8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the middle, </span>
<span class='v JN8_4' data-id='JN8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>they told him, “Teacher, we found this woman in adultery, in the very act. </span>
<span class='v JN8_5' data-id='JN8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.<span class='note' id='footnote-940'><a href='#note-940' class='key'>✡</a></span> What then do you say about her?” </span>
<span class='v JN8_6' data-id='JN8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They said this testing him, that they might have something to accuse him of. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_6' data-id='JN8_6'>But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. </span>
<span class='v JN8_7' data-id='JN8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But when they continued asking him, he looked up and said to them, <span class='wj'>“He who is without sin among you, let him throw the first stone at her.” </span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_8' data-id='JN8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. </span></div>

<span class='v JN8_9' data-id='JN8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They, when they heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was, in the middle. </span>
<span class='v JN8_10' data-id='JN8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus, standing up, saw her and said, <span class='wj'>“Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one condemn you?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_11' data-id='JN8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>She said, “No one, Lord.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN8_12' data-id='JN8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“I am the light of the world.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-942'><a href='#note-942' class='key'>✡</a></span> <span class='wj'>He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_13' data-id='JN8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said to him, “You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_19' data-id='JN8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, “Where is your Father?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_19' data-id='JN8_19'>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_20' data-id='JN8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jesus spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. </span>
<span class='v JN8_21' data-id='JN8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said therefore again to them, <span class='wj'>“I am going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I go, you can’t come.” </span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_22' data-id='JN8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Jews therefore said, “Will he kill himself, because he says, <span class='wj'>‘Where I am going, you can’t come’</span>?” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_25' data-id='JN8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They said therefore to him, “Who are you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_25' data-id='JN8_25'>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_26' data-id='JN8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. However he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN8_27' data-id='JN8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They didn’t understand that he spoke to them about the Father. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_30' data-id='JN8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>As he spoke these things, many believed in him. </span>
<span class='v JN8_31' data-id='JN8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him, <span class='wj'>“If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples. </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_33' data-id='JN8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “We are Abraham’s offspring, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do you say, <span class='wj'>‘You will be made free’</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_34' data-id='JN8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Most certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin. </span> </span>

<span class='v JN8_37' data-id='JN8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I know that you are Abraham’s offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_39' data-id='JN8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “Our father is Abraham.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN8_42' data-id='JN8_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Therefore Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“If God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_43' data-id='JN8_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Why don’t you understand my speech? Because you can’t hear my word. </span> </span>

<span class='v JN8_45' data-id='JN8_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But because I tell the truth, you don’t believe me. </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_52' data-id='JN8_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, <span class='wj'>‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_53' data-id='JN8_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_54' data-id='JN8_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is our God. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_55' data-id='JN8_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You have not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be like you, a liar. But I know him and keep his word. </span> </span>
