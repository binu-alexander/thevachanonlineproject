<span class='v MT20_2' data-id='MT20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius</span><span class='note' id='footnote-729'><a href='#note-729' class='key'>*</a></span> <span class='wj'>a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_3' data-id='MT20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He went out about the third hour,</span><span class='note' id='footnote-730'><a href='#note-730' class='key'>†</a></span> <span class='wj'>and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_4' data-id='MT20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_5' data-id='MT20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,</span><span class='note' id='footnote-731'><a href='#note-731' class='key'>‡</a></span> <span class='wj'>and did likewise. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_6' data-id='MT20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>About the eleventh hour</span><span class='note' id='footnote-732'><a href='#note-732' class='key'>§</a></span> <span class='wj'>he went out, and found others standing idle.

<span class='v MT20_7' data-id='MT20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_7' data-id='MT20_7'><span class='wj'>“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_8' data-id='MT20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_11' data-id='MT20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_12' data-id='MT20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ </span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_13' data-id='MT20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a denarius? </span> </span>

<span class='v MT20_17' data-id='MT20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_20' data-id='MT20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him. </span>
<span class='v MT20_21' data-id='MT20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He said to her, <span class='wj'>“What do you want?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_21' data-id='MT20_21'>She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand, and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.” </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_22' data-id='MT20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_22' data-id='MT20_22'>They said to him, “We are able.” </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_23' data-id='MT20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with, but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_24' data-id='MT20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers. </span></div>

<span class='v MT20_25' data-id='MT20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class='wj'>“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span> </span>
<span class='v MT20_26' data-id='MT20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It shall not be so among you, but whoever desires to become great among you shall be</span><span class='note' id='footnote-733'><a href='#note-733' class='key'>*</a></span> <span class='wj'>your servant. </span> </span>

<span class='v MT20_28' data-id='MT20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_29' data-id='MT20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT20_30' data-id='MT20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” </span>
<span class='v MT20_31' data-id='MT20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_32' data-id='MT20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus stood still, and called them, and asked, <span class='wj'>“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_33' data-id='MT20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” </span></div>
