<span class='v T21_1' data-id='T21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v T21_2' data-id='T21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_3' data-id='T21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day </span>
<span class='v T21_4' data-id='T21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; </span>
<span class='v T21_5' data-id='T21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and, I am persuaded, in you also. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_6' data-id='T21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. </span>
<span class='v T21_7' data-id='T21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. </span>
<span class='v T21_8' data-id='T21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, </span>
<span class='v T21_9' data-id='T21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, </span>
<span class='v T21_10' data-id='T21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. </span>
<span class='v T21_11' data-id='T21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v T21_12' data-id='T21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For this cause I also suffer these things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_12' data-id='T21_12'>Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_13' data-id='T21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_15' data-id='T21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. </span>
<span class='v T21_16' data-id='T21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, </span>
<span class='v T21_17' data-id='T21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me </span>
<span class='v T21_18' data-id='T21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well. </span></div></div>
