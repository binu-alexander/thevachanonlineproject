<span class='v JR25_1' data-id='JR25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), </span>
<span class='v JR25_2' data-id='JR25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: </span>
<span class='v JR25_3' data-id='JR25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years, Yahweh’s word has come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking; but you have not listened. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR25_4' data-id='JR25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear), </span>
<span class='v JR25_5' data-id='JR25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>saying, “Return now everyone from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers, from of old and even forever more. </span>
<span class='v JR25_6' data-id='JR25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them, and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands; then I will do you no harm.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR25_7' data-id='JR25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Yet you have not listened to me,” says Yahweh; “that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR25_8' data-id='JR25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh of Armies says: “Because you have not heard my words, </span>
<span class='v JR25_9' data-id='JR25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,” says Yahweh, “and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around. I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. </span>
<span class='v JR25_10' data-id='JR25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp. </span>
