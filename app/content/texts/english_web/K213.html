<span class='v K213_1' data-id='K213_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria for seventeen years. </span>
<span class='v K213_2' data-id='K213_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin. He didn’t depart from it. </span>
<span class='v K213_3' data-id='K213_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh’s anger burned against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, continually. </span>
<span class='v K213_4' data-id='K213_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz begged Yahweh, and Yahweh listened to him; for he saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppressed them. </span>
<span class='v K213_5' data-id='K213_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>(Yahweh gave Israel a savior, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before. </span>
<span class='v K213_6' data-id='K213_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless they didn’t depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin, but walked in them; and the Asherah also remained in Samaria.) </span>
<span class='v K213_7' data-id='K213_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For he didn’t leave to Jehoahaz of the people any more than fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria destroyed them, and made them like the dust in threshing. </span>
<span class='v K213_8' data-id='K213_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K213_9' data-id='K213_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash his son reigned in his place. </span></div>

<span class='v K213_12' data-id='K213_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K213_13' data-id='K213_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat on his throne. Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_18' data-id='K213_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He said, “Take the arrows;” and he took them. He said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground;” and he struck three times, and stopped. </span>
<span class='v K213_19' data-id='K213_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The man of God was angry with him, and said, “You should have struck five or six times. Then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it; whereas now you will strike Syria just three times.” </span></div>
