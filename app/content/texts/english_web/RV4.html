<span class='v RV4_1' data-id='RV4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, “Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.” </span></div>

<span class='v RV4_2' data-id='RV4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne </span>
<span class='v RV4_3' data-id='RV4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at. </span>
<span class='v RV4_4' data-id='RV4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads. </span>
<span class='v RV4_5' data-id='RV4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. </span>
<span class='v RV4_6' data-id='RV4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind. </span>
