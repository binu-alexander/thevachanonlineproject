<span class='v MT28_2' data-id='MT28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it. </span>
<span class='v MT28_3' data-id='MT28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. </span>
<span class='v MT28_4' data-id='MT28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. </span>
<span class='v MT28_5' data-id='MT28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. </span>

<span class='v MT28_8' data-id='MT28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. </span>
<span class='v MT28_9' data-id='MT28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Rejoice!”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_9' data-id='MT28_9'>They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him. </span></div>

<span class='v MT28_10' data-id='MT28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid.

<span class='v MT28_12' data-id='MT28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers, </span>
<span class='v MT28_13' data-id='MT28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. </span>
<span class='v MT28_14' data-id='MT28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_15' data-id='MT28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until today. </span></div>
