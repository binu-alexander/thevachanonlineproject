<span class='v JR11_1' data-id='JR11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR11_2' data-id='JR11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </span>
<span class='v JR11_3' data-id='JR11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say to them, Yahweh, the God of Israel says: ‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant, </span>
<span class='v JR11_4' data-id='JR11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace,’ saying, ‘Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you; so you shall be my people, and I will be your God; </span>
<span class='v JR11_5' data-id='JR11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_5' data-id='JR11_5'>Then I answered, and said, “Amen, Yahweh.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_6' data-id='JR11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Hear the words of this covenant, and do them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_7' data-id='JR11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, “Obey my voice.” </span>
<span class='v JR11_8' data-id='JR11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yet they didn’t obey, nor turn their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart. Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn’t do them.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_9' data-id='JR11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, “A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR11_10' data-id='JR11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. </span>
<span class='v JR11_11' data-id='JR11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore Yahweh says, ‘Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_12' data-id='JR11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense, but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble. </span>
<span class='v JR11_13' data-id='JR11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_14' data-id='JR11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Therefore don’t pray for this people. Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What has my beloved to do in my house, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'>since she has behaved lewdly with many, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'>and the holy flesh has passed from you? </span></div>

<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'>then you rejoice.” </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_16' data-id='JR11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Yahweh called your name, “A green olive tree, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_16' data-id='JR11_16'>beautiful with goodly fruit.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_16' data-id='JR11_16'>With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_16' data-id='JR11_16'>and its branches are broken. </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JR11_17' data-id='JR11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh of Armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_18' data-id='JR11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it. Then you showed me their doings. </span>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter. I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>that his name may be no more remembered.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But, Yahweh of Armies, who judges righteously, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>who tests the heart and the mind, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>I will see your vengeance on them; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>for to you I have revealed my cause. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_21' data-id='JR11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, saying, ‘You shall not prophesy in Yahweh’s name, that you not die by our hand;’ </span>
<span class='v JR11_22' data-id='JR11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>therefore Yahweh of Armies says, ‘Behold, I will punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and their daughters will die by famine. </span>
<span class='v JR11_23' data-id='JR11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>There will be no remnant to them, for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.’ ” </span></div></div>
