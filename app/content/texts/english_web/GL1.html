</div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_1' data-id='GL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— </span>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and all the brothers<span class='note' id='footnote-1195'><a href='#note-1195' class='key'>*</a></span> who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: </span>
<span class='v GL1_3' data-id='GL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v GL1_4' data-id='GL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— </span>
<span class='v GL1_5' data-id='GL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_6' data-id='GL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”, </span>
<span class='v GL1_7' data-id='GL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_8' data-id='GL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. </span>
<span class='v GL1_9' data-id='GL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. </span>
<span class='v GL1_10' data-id='GL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_11' data-id='GL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. </span>
<span class='v GL1_12' data-id='GL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_13' data-id='GL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it. </span>
<span class='v GL1_14' data-id='GL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </span>
<span class='v GL1_15' data-id='GL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace </span>
<span class='v GL1_16' data-id='GL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood, </span>
<span class='v GL1_17' data-id='GL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_18' data-id='GL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. </span>
<span class='v GL1_19' data-id='GL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother. </span>
<span class='v GL1_20' data-id='GL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now about the things which I write to you, behold,<span class='note' id='footnote-1196'><a href='#note-1196' class='key'>†</a></span> before God, I’m not lying. </span>
<span class='v GL1_21' data-id='GL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v GL1_22' data-id='GL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, </span>
<span class='v GL1_23' data-id='GL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.” </span>
<span class='v GL1_24' data-id='GL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So they glorified God in me. </span></div></div>
