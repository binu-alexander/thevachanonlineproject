<span class='v P13_2' data-id='P13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>seeing your pure behavior in fear. </span>
<span class='v P13_3' data-id='P13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let your beauty be not just the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on fine clothing; </span>
<span class='v P13_4' data-id='P13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but in the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. </span>
<span class='v P13_5' data-id='P13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this is how in the past, the holy women who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands. </span>
<span class='v P13_6' data-id='P13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose children you now are, if you do well, and are not put in fear by any terror. </span></div>

<span class='v P13_8' data-id='P13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally, all of you be like-minded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous, </span>
<span class='v P13_9' data-id='P13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>not rendering evil for evil, or insult for insult; but instead blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. </span>

<span class='v P13_15' data-id='P13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, with humility and fear, </span>

<span class='v P13_17' data-id='P13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For it is better, if it is God’s will, that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil. </span>
<span class='v P13_18' data-id='P13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, </span>
