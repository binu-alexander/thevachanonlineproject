<span class='v EC3_10' data-id='EC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I have seen the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. </span>
<span class='v EC3_11' data-id='EC3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can’t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end. </span>
<span class='v EC3_12' data-id='EC3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live. </span>

<span class='v EC3_16' data-id='EC3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there. </span>
<span class='v EC3_17' data-id='EC3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.” </span>
<span class='v EC3_18' data-id='EC3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, “As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals. </span>
<span class='v EC3_19' data-id='EC3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them.
