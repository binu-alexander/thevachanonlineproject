<span class='v JR13_1' data-id='JR13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Yahweh said to me, “Go, and buy yourself a linen belt, and put it on your waist, and don’t put it in water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_2' data-id='JR13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So I bought a belt according to Yahweh’s word, and put it on my waist. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_3' data-id='JR13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yahweh’s word came to me the second time, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR13_4' data-id='JR13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Take the belt that you have bought, which is on your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_5' data-id='JR13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as Yahweh commanded me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_6' data-id='JR13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After many days, Yahweh said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the belt from there, which I commanded you to hide there.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_7' data-id='JR13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the belt was ruined. It was profitable for nothing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_8' data-id='JR13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR13_9' data-id='JR13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Yahweh says, ‘In this way I, will ruin the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR13_10' data-id='JR13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and have gone after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, will even be as this belt, which is profitable for nothing. </span>
<span class='v JR13_11' data-id='JR13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For as the belt clings to the waist of a man, so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says Yahweh; ‘that they may be to me for a people, for a name, for praise, and for glory; but they would not hear.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_12' data-id='JR13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Therefore you shall speak to them this word: ‘Yahweh, the God of Israel says, “Every container should be filled with wine.” ’ They will tell you, ‘Do we not certainly know that every container should be filled with wine?’ </span>
<span class='v JR13_13' data-id='JR13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then tell them, ‘Yahweh says, “Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. </span>
<span class='v JR13_14' data-id='JR13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together,” says Yahweh: “I will not pity, spare, or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.” ’ ” </span></div>
