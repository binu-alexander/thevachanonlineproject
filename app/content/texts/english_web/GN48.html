<span class='v GN48_1' data-id='GN48_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things, someone said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” He took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. </span>
<span class='v GN48_2' data-id='GN48_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. </span>
<span class='v GN48_3' data-id='GN48_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, </span>
<span class='v GN48_4' data-id='GN48_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ </span>
<span class='v GN48_5' data-id='GN48_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. </span>
<span class='v GN48_6' data-id='GN48_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v GN48_7' data-id='GN48_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_8' data-id='GN48_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?” </span></div>

<span class='v GN48_10' data-id='GN48_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. </span>
<span class='v GN48_11' data-id='GN48_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” </span>

<span class='v GN48_17' data-id='GN48_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. </span>
<span class='v GN48_18' data-id='GN48_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.” </span></div>
