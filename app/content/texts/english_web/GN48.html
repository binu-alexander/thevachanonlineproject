<span class='v GN48_2' data-id='GN48_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Someone told Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. </span>

<span class='v GN48_5' data-id='GN48_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine. </span>
<span class='v GN48_6' data-id='GN48_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your offspring, whom you become the father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v GN48_7' data-id='GN48_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (also called Bethlehem).” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_8' data-id='GN48_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said, “Who are these?” </span></div>

<span class='v GN48_18' data-id='GN48_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.” </span></div>
