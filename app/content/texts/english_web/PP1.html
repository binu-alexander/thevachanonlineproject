<span class='v PP1_3' data-id='PP1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I thank my God whenever I remember you, </span>
<span class='v PP1_4' data-id='PP1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>always in every request of mine on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy, </span>
<span class='v PP1_5' data-id='PP1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for your partnership<span class='note' id='footnote-1222'><a href='#note-1222' class='key'>‡</a></span> in furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now; </span>
<span class='v PP1_6' data-id='PP1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP1_7' data-id='PP1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart, because both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News, you all are partakers with me of grace. </span>
<span class='v PP1_8' data-id='PP1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For God is my witness, how I long after all of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_9' data-id='PP1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment, </span>
<span class='v PP1_10' data-id='PP1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of Christ, </span>

<span class='v PP1_12' data-id='PP1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now I desire to have you know, brothers,<span class='note' id='footnote-1223'><a href='#note-1223' class='key'>§</a></span> that the things which happened to me have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News, </span>
<span class='v PP1_13' data-id='PP1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>so that it became evident to the whole palace<span class='note' id='footnote-1224'><a href='#note-1224' class='key'>*</a></span> guard, and to all the rest, that my bonds are in Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP1_14' data-id='PP1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and that most of the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. </span>
<span class='v PP1_15' data-id='PP1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy and strife, and some also out of good will. </span>
<span class='v PP1_16' data-id='PP1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The former insincerely preach Christ from selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains; </span>
<span class='v PP1_17' data-id='PP1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>but the latter out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice. </span>
<span class='v PP1_19' data-id='PP1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP1_20' data-id='PP1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. </span>
<span class='v PP1_21' data-id='PP1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. </span>
<span class='v PP1_22' data-id='PP1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But if I live on in the flesh, this will bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose. </span>
<span class='v PP1_23' data-id='PP1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But I am hard pressed between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better. </span>
<span class='v PP1_24' data-id='PP1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Yet to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake. </span>
<span class='v PP1_25' data-id='PP1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Having this confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all for your progress and joy in the faith, </span>
<span class='v PP1_26' data-id='PP1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>that your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_27' data-id='PP1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ, that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News; </span>
<span class='v PP1_28' data-id='PP1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and that from God. </span>
<span class='v PP1_29' data-id='PP1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Because it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on his behalf, </span>
<span class='v PP1_30' data-id='PP1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me. </span></div></div>
