<span class='v R25_5' data-id='R25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and they brought up the ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent; these the Levitical priests brought up. </span>

<span class='v R25_8' data-id='R25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its poles above. </span>
