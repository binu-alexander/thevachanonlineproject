<span class='v H15_1' data-id='H15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But as to the times and the moments, there is no need, friends, for anyone to write to you. </span>
<span class='v H15_2' data-id='H15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know well that the day of the Lord will come just as a thief comes in the night. </span>
<span class='v H15_3' data-id='H15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When people are saying ‘All is quiet and safe,’ it is then that, like birth pains on a pregnant woman, ruin comes suddenly upon them, and there will be no escape! </span>
<span class='v H15_4' data-id='H15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You, however, friends, are not in darkness, that the daylight should take you by surprise as if you were thieves. </span>

<span class='v H15_8' data-id='H15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But let us, who belong to the day, control ourselves, and put on faith and love as a breast plate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. </span>
<span class='v H15_9' data-id='H15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God destined us, not for wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, </span>
<span class='v H15_10' data-id='H15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that, whether we are still watching or have fallen asleep, we may live with him. </span>
