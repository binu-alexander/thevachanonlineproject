<span class='v JN4_1' data-id='JN4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now, when the Master heard that the Pharisees had been told that he was making and baptizing more disciples than John </span>
<span class='v JN4_2' data-id='JN4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>(Though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who baptized), </span>
<span class='v JN4_3' data-id='JN4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>he left Judea, and set out again for Galilee. </span>
<span class='v JN4_4' data-id='JN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He had to pass through Samaria, </span>
<span class='v JN4_5' data-id='JN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and, on his way, he came to a Samaritan town called Shechem, near the plot of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </span>
<span class='v JN4_6' data-id='JN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jacob's Spring was there, and Jesus, being tired after his journey, sat down beside the spring, just as he was. It was then about midday. </span>
<span class='v JN4_7' data-id='JN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A woman of Samaria came to draw water; and Jesus said to her — <span class='wj'>“Give me some to drink,”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_8' data-id='JN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For his disciples had gone into the town to buy food. </span>
<span class='v JN4_9' data-id='JN4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“How is it,” replied the Samaritan woman, “that you who are a Jew ask for water from a Samaritan woman like me?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans). </span>
<span class='v JN4_10' data-id='JN4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If you knew of the gift of God,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and who it is that is saying to you ‘Give me some water,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_11' data-id='JN4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“You have no bucket, Sir, and the well is deep,” she said; “where did you get that ‘living water?’ </span>
<span class='v JN4_12' data-id='JN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Surely you are not greater than our ancestor Jacob who gave us the well, and used to drink from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_13' data-id='JN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“All who drink of this water,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“will be thirsty again;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_14' data-id='JN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but whoever once drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst any more; but the water that I will give him will become a spring welling up within him — a source of eternal life.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_15' data-id='JN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Give me this water, Sir,” said the woman, “so that I may not be thirsty, nor have to come all the way here to draw water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_16' data-id='JN4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Go and call your husband,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and then come back.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_17' data-id='JN4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“I have no husband,” answered the woman. <span class='wj'>“You are right in saying ‘I have no husband,’ ”</span> replied Jesus, </span>
<span class='v JN4_18' data-id='JN4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“For you have had five husbands, and the man with whom you are now living is not your husband; in saying that, you have spoken the truth.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_19' data-id='JN4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“I see, Sir, that you are a prophet!” exclaimed the woman. </span>
<span class='v JN4_20' data-id='JN4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“It was on this mountain that our ancestors worshiped; and yet you Jews say that the proper place for worship is in Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_21' data-id='JN4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Believe me,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“a time is coming when it will be neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem that you will worship the Father.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_22' data-id='JN4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You Samaritans do not know what you worship; we know what we worship, for salvation comes from the Jews.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_23' data-id='JN4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But a time is coming, indeed it is already here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father spiritually and truly; for such are the worshipers that the Father desires.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_24' data-id='JN4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>God is Spirit; and those who worship him must worship spiritually and truly.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_25' data-id='JN4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“I know,” answered the woman, “that the Messiah, who is called the Christ, is coming; when once he has come, he will tell us everything.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_26' data-id='JN4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I am he,”</span> Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“I who am speaking to you.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_27' data-id='JN4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>At this moment his disciples came up, and were surprised to find him talking with a woman; but none of them asked ‘What do you want?’ or ‘Why are you talking with her?’ </span>
<span class='v JN4_28' data-id='JN4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So the woman, leaving her pitcher, went back to the town, and said to the people, </span>
<span class='v JN4_29' data-id='JN4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Come and see someone who has told me everything that I have done. Can he be the Christ?” </span>
<span class='v JN4_30' data-id='JN4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the people left the town and went to see Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_31' data-id='JN4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the disciples kept saying to him, “Take something to eat, Rabbi.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_32' data-id='JN4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I have food to eat,”</span> he answered, <span class='wj'>“of which you know nothing.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_33' data-id='JN4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“Can anyone have brought him anything to eat?” the disciples said to one another. </span>
<span class='v JN4_34' data-id='JN4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“My food,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“is to do the will of him who sent me, and to complete his work.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_35' data-id='JN4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Don't you say that it still wants four months to harvest? Why, look up, and see how white the fields are for harvest!</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_36' data-id='JN4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Already the reaper is receiving wages and gathering in sheaves for eternal life, so that sower and reaper rejoice together.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_37' data-id='JN4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For here the proverb holds good — ‘One sows, another reaps.’</span> </span>
<span class='v JN4_38' data-id='JN4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have sent you to reap that on which you have spent no labor; others have labored, and you have reaped the results of their labor.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_39' data-id='JN4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Many from that town came to believe in Jesus — Samaritans though they were — because the woman had said, ‘He has told me everything that I have done.’ </span>
<span class='v JN4_40' data-id='JN4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And, when these Samaritans had come to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. </span>
<span class='v JN4_41' data-id='JN4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>But far more came to believe in him because of what he said himself, </span>
<span class='v JN4_42' data-id='JN4_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>and they said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you say that we believe in him, for we have heard him ourselves and know that he really is the Savior of the world.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_43' data-id='JN4_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>After these two days Jesus went on to Galilee; </span>
<span class='v JN4_44' data-id='JN4_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>for he himself declared that ‘a prophet is not honored in his own country.’ </span>
<span class='v JN4_45' data-id='JN4_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When he entered Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, for they had seen all that he did at Jerusalem during the Festival, at which they also had been present. </span>
<span class='v JN4_46' data-id='JN4_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>So Jesus came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was one of the king's officers whose son was lying ill at Capernaum. </span>
<span class='v JN4_47' data-id='JN4_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When this man heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to him, and begged him to come down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death. </span>
<span class='v JN4_48' data-id='JN4_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Unless you all see signs and wonders, you will not believe.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_49' data-id='JN4_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” said the officer, “come down before my child dies.” And Jesus answered, “Go, your son is living.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_50' data-id='JN4_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>The man believed what Jesus said to him, and went; </span>
<span class='v JN4_51' data-id='JN4_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>and, while he was on his way down, his servants met him, and told him that his child was living. </span>
<span class='v JN4_52' data-id='JN4_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>So he asked them at what time the boy began to get better. “It was yesterday, about one o'clock,” they said, “that the fever left him.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_53' data-id='JN4_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>By this the father knew that it was at the very time when Jesus had said to him <span class='wj'>‘Your son is living’</span>; and he himself, with all his household, believed in Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN4_54' data-id='JN4_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>This was the second occasion on which Jesus gave a sign of his mission on coming from Judea to Galilee. </span></div></div>
