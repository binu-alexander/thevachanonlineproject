<span class='v RT1_1' data-id='RT1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the time when the judges ruled, there was once a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah took his wife and two sons to live in the territory of Moab. </span>
<span class='v RT1_2' data-id='RT1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>His name was Elimelech and his wife's was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. After they had been living in Moab for some time, </span>
<span class='v RT1_3' data-id='RT1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons, </span>
<span class='v RT1_4' data-id='RT1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, </span>
<span class='v RT1_5' data-id='RT1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Mahlon and Chilion both died, and Naomi was left alone, without husband or sons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_6' data-id='RT1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, for she had heard that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had remembered his people and given them food. </span>
<span class='v RT1_7' data-id='RT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As they were setting out together on the journey to Judah, </span>
<span class='v RT1_8' data-id='RT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to her daughters-in-law, “Go, return both of you to the home of your mother. May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be kind to you as you have been kind to the dead and to me. </span>
<span class='v RT1_9' data-id='RT1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> grant that each of you may find peace and happiness in the house of a new husband.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_9' data-id='RT1_9'>Then she kissed them; but they began to weep aloud </span>
<span class='v RT1_10' data-id='RT1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.” </span>
<span class='v RT1_11' data-id='RT1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters; why should you go with me? Can I still bear sons who might become your husbands? </span>
<span class='v RT1_12' data-id='RT1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Go back, my daughters, go your own way, because I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, ‘I have hope,’ even if I should have a husband tonight and should bear sons, </span>
<span class='v RT1_13' data-id='RT1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>would you wait for them until they were grown up? Would you remain single for them? No, my daughters! My heart grieves for you, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has sent me adversity.” </span>
<span class='v RT1_14' data-id='RT1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then they again wept aloud, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth stayed with her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_15' data-id='RT1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and to her own gods; go along with her!” </span>
<span class='v RT1_16' data-id='RT1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Ruth answered, “Do not urge me to leave you or to go back. I will go where you go, and I will stay wherever you stay. Your people will be my people, and your God my God; </span>
<span class='v RT1_17' data-id='RT1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will die where you die, and be buried there. May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bring a curse upon me, if anything but death separate you and me.” </span>
<span class='v RT1_18' data-id='RT1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased urging her to return. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_19' data-id='RT1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So they journeyed on until they came to Bethlehem. Their arrival stirred the whole town, and the women said, “Can this be Naomi?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_20' data-id='RT1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Do not call me Naomi,” she said to them, “call me Mara<span class='note' id='footnote-0'><a href='#note-0' class='key'>*</a></span>, for the Almighty has given me a bitter lot. </span>
<span class='v RT1_21' data-id='RT1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I had plenty when I left, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has brought me back empty handed. Why should you call me Naomi, now that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has afflicted me, and the Almighty has brought misfortune on me?” </span>
<span class='v RT1_22' data-id='RT1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So Naomi and Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law, returned from Moab. They reached Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest. </span></div></div>
