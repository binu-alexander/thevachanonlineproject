<span class='v MT11_1' data-id='MT11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had finished giving directions to his twelve Disciples, he left that place in order to teach and preach in their towns. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_2' data-id='MT11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now John had heard in prison what the Christ was doing, and he sent a message by his disciples, </span>
<span class='v MT11_3' data-id='MT11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and asked — “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?” </span>
<span class='v MT11_4' data-id='MT11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The answer of Jesus to the question was — <span class='wj'>“Go and report to John what you hear and see —</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_5' data-id='MT11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>the blind recover their sight and the lame walk, the lepers are made clean and the deaf hear, the dead, too, are raised to life, and the good news is told to the poor.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_6' data-id='MT11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_7' data-id='MT11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>While John's disciples were going back, Jesus began to say to the crowds with reference to John, </span>
<span class='v MT11_8' data-id='MT11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man richly dressed? Why, those who wear rich things are to be found in the courts of kings!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_9' data-id='MT11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>What, then, did you go for? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_10' data-id='MT11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This is the man of whom scripture says — ‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_11' data-id='MT11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, no one born of a woman has yet appeared who is greater than John the Baptist; and yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_12' data-id='MT11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>From the time of John the Baptist to this very hour, the kingdom of heaven has been taken by force, and people using force have been seizing it.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_13' data-id='MT11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For the teaching of all the prophets and of the Law continued until the time of John;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_14' data-id='MT11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and — if you are ready to accept it — John is himself the Elijah who was destined to come.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_15' data-id='MT11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If you have ears, listen.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_16' data-id='MT11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But to what will I compare the present generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-places and calling out to their playmates —</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_17' data-id='MT11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not mourned.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_18' data-id='MT11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, when John came, neither eating nor drinking, people said ‘He has a demon in him’;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_19' data-id='MT11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, they are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts!’ And yet wisdom is vindicated by her actions.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_20' data-id='MT11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus began to reproach the towns in which most of his miracles had been done, because they had not repented, </span>
<span class='v MT11_21' data-id='MT11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For, if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_22' data-id='MT11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet, I tell you, the doom of Tyre and Sidon will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_23' data-id='MT11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And you, Capernaum! Will you exalt yourself to heaven? You will be flung down to Hades! For, if the miracles which have been done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have been standing to this day.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_24' data-id='MT11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet, I tell you, the doom of Sodom will be more bearable in the day of judgment than yours.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_25' data-id='MT11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At that same time Jesus uttered the words, <span class='wj'>“I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that, though you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, you have revealed them to the child-like!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_26' data-id='MT11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yes, Father, I thank you that this has seemed good to you.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_27' data-id='MT11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Everything has been committed to me by my Father; nor does anyone fully know the Son, except the Father, or fully know the Father, except the Son and those to whom the Son may choose to reveal him.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_28' data-id='MT11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_29' data-id='MT11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT11_30' data-id='MT11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”</span> </span></div></div>
