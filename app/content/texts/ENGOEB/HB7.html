<div class='c'>7</div>
<div class='s'>Paramount Priesthood of the Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB7_1' data-id='HB7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It was this Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and gave him his blessing; </span>
<span class='v HB7_2' data-id='HB7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and it was to him that Abraham allotted a tithe of all the spoil. The meaning of his name is ‘king of righteousness,’ and besides that, he was also king of Salem, which means ‘king of peace.’ </span>
<span class='v HB7_3' data-id='HB7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>There is no record of his father, or mother, or lineage, nor again of any beginning of his days, or end of his life. In this he resembles the Son of God, and stands before us as a priest whose priesthood is continuous. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB7_4' data-id='HB7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Consider, then the importance of this Melchizedek, to whom even the patriarch Abraham himself gave a tithe of the choicest spoils. </span>
<span class='v HB7_5' data-id='HB7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Those descendants of Levi, who are from time to time appointed to the priesthood, are directed to collect tithes from the people in accordance with the Law — that is from their own kindred, although they also are descended from Abraham. </span>
<span class='v HB7_6' data-id='HB7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Melchizedek, although not of this lineage, received tithes from Abraham, and gave his blessing to the man who had God's promises. </span>
<span class='v HB7_7' data-id='HB7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now no one can dispute that it is the superior who blesses the inferior. </span>
<span class='v HB7_8' data-id='HB7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the one case the tithes are received by people who are mortal; in the other case by one about whom there is the statement that his life still continues. </span>
<span class='v HB7_9' data-id='HB7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Moreover, in a sense, even Levi, who is the receiver of the tithes, has, through Abraham, paid tithes; </span>
<span class='v HB7_10' data-id='HB7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for Levi was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB7_11' data-id='HB7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If, then, perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood — and it was under this priesthood that the people received the Law — why was it still necessary that a priest of a different order should appear, a priest of the order of Melchizedek and not of the order of Aaron? </span>
<span class='v HB7_12' data-id='HB7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>With the change of the priesthood a change of the Law became a necessity. </span>
<span class='v HB7_13' data-id='HB7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he of whom all this is said belonged to quite a different tribe, no member of which has ever served at the altar. </span>
<span class='v HB7_14' data-id='HB7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For it is plain that our Lord had sprung from the tribe of Judah, though of that tribe Moses said nothing about their being priests. </span>
<span class='v HB7_15' data-id='HB7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All this becomes even yet plainer when we remember that a new priest has appeared, resembling Melchizedek, </span>
<span class='v HB7_16' data-id='HB7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and that he was appointed, not under a Law regulating only earthly matters, but by virtue of a life beyond the reach of death; </span>
<span class='v HB7_17' data-id='HB7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>for that is the meaning of the declaration — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB7_17' data-id='HB7_17'>‘You are for all time a priest of the order of Melchizedek.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB7_18' data-id='HB7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>On the one hand, we have the abolition of a previous regulation as being both inefficient and useless </span>
<span class='v HB7_19' data-id='HB7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>(for the Law never brought anything to perfection); and, on the other hand, we have the introduction of a better hope, which enables us to draw near to God. </span>
<span class='v HB7_20' data-id='HB7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then again, the appointment of this new priest was ratified by an oath, which is not so with the Levitical priests, </span>
<span class='v HB7_21' data-id='HB7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but his appointment was ratified by an oath, when God said to him — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB7_21' data-id='HB7_21'>‘The Lord has sworn, and will not change, “You are a priest for all time.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB7_22' data-id='HB7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the oath shows the corresponding superiority of the covenant of which Jesus is appointed the surety. </span>
<span class='v HB7_23' data-id='HB7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Again, new Levitical priests are continually being appointed, because death prevents their remaining in office; </span>
<span class='v HB7_24' data-id='HB7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>but Jesus remains for all time, and therefore the priesthood that he holds will never pass to another. </span>
<span class='v HB7_25' data-id='HB7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And that is why he is able to save perfectly those who come to God through him, living for ever, as he does, to intercede of their behalf. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB7_26' data-id='HB7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>This was the high priest that we needed — holy, innocent, spotless, withdrawn from sinners, exalted above the highest heaven, </span>
<span class='v HB7_27' data-id='HB7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>one who has no need to offer sacrifices daily as those high priests have, first for their own sins, and then for those of the people. For this he did once and for all, when he offered himself as the sacrifice. </span>
<span class='v HB7_28' data-id='HB7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The Law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the words of God's oath, which was later than the Law, name the Son as, for all time, the perfect priest. </span></div></div>
