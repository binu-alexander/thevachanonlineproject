<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_1' data-id='JN21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Later on, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias. </span>
<span class='v JN21_2' data-id='JN21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It was in this way, — Simon Peter, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples of Jesus, were together, when Simon Peter said, </span>
<span class='v JN21_3' data-id='JN21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“I am going fishing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_3' data-id='JN21_3'>“We will come with you,” said the others. They went out and got into the boat, but caught nothing that night. </span>
<span class='v JN21_4' data-id='JN21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Just as day was breaking, Jesus came and stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was he. </span>
<span class='v JN21_5' data-id='JN21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“My children,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“have you anything to eat?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_5' data-id='JN21_5'>“No,” they answered. </span>
<span class='v JN21_6' data-id='JN21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Cast your net to the right of the boat,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and you will find fish.”</span> So they cast the net, and now they could not haul it in because of the quantity of fish. </span>
<span class='v JN21_7' data-id='JN21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Master!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Master, he fastened his coat around him (for he had taken it off), and threw himself into the sea. </span>
<span class='v JN21_8' data-id='JN21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But the rest of the disciples came in the boat (for they were only about a hundred yards from shore), dragging the net full of fish. </span>
<span class='v JN21_9' data-id='JN21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they had come ashore, they found a charcoal fire ready, with some fish already on it, and some bread as well. </span>
<span class='v JN21_10' data-id='JN21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Bring some of the fish which you have just caught,”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN21_11' data-id='JN21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Simon Peter got into the boat and hauled the net ashore full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not been torn. </span>
<span class='v JN21_12' data-id='JN21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Come and have breakfast.”</span>, Jesus said. None of the disciples dared ask him who he was, because they knew it was the Master. </span>
<span class='v JN21_13' data-id='JN21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish too. </span>
<span class='v JN21_14' data-id='JN21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from the dead. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When breakfast was over, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than the others?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'>“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'><span class='wj'>“Feed my lambs,”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then, a second time, Jesus asked, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'>“Yes, Master,” he answered, “you know that I am your friend.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'><span class='wj'>“Tend my sheep,”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN21_17' data-id='JN21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The third time, Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Simon, son of John, are you my friend?”</span> Peter was hurt at his third question being ‘Are you my friend?’; and exclaimed, “Master, you know everything! You can tell that I am your friend.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_17' data-id='JN21_17'><span class='wj'>“Feed my sheep,”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN21_18' data-id='JN21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“In truth I tell you,” he continued, “when you were young, you used to put on your own clothes, and walk wherever you wished; but, when you have grown old, you will have to stretch out your hands, while someone else puts on your clothes, and takes you where you do not wish.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN21_19' data-id='JN21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus said this to show the death by which Peter was to honor God, and then he added, <span class='wj'>“Follow me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN21_20' data-id='JN21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Peter turned around, and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following — the one who at the supper leant back on the Master's shoulder, and asked him who it was who would betray him. </span>
<span class='v JN21_21' data-id='JN21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, what about this man?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_22' data-id='JN21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If it is my will that he should wait until I come,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“what has that to do with you? Follow me yourself.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN21_23' data-id='JN21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So the report spread among his followers that that disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said <span class='wj'>“If it is my will that he should wait until I come, what has that to do with you?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_24' data-id='JN21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>It is this disciple who states these things, and who recorded them; and we know that his statement is true. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_25' data-id='JN21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>There are many other things which Jesus did; but, if every one of them were to be recorded in detail, I suppose that even the world itself would not hold the books that would be written. </span></div></div>
