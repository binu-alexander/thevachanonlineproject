<span class='v MK1_1' data-id='MK1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_2' data-id='MK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It is said in the prophet Isaiah — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK1_2' data-id='MK1_2'>‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK1_2' data-id='MK1_2'>he will prepare your way. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK1_3' data-id='MK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK1_3' data-id='MK1_3'>“Prepare the road for the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v MK1_3' data-id='MK1_3'>make a straight path for him.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MK1_4' data-id='MK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>John the Baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. </span>
<span class='v MK1_5' data-id='MK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The whole of Judea, as well as all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, went out to him; and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_6' data-id='MK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>John wore clothes made of camels' hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and lived on locusts and wild honey; </span>
<span class='v MK1_7' data-id='MK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and he proclaimed — “After me is coming someone more powerful than I am, and I am not fit even to stoop down and unfasten his sandals. </span>
<span class='v MK1_8' data-id='MK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_9' data-id='MK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now about that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v MK1_10' data-id='MK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit coming down to him like a dove, </span>
<span class='v MK1_11' data-id='MK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and from the heavens came a voice — “You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_12' data-id='MK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Immediately afterward the Spirit drove Jesus out into the wilderness; </span>
<span class='v MK1_13' data-id='MK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan, and among the wild beasts, while the angels helped him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Work in Galilee </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_14' data-id='MK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>After John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God — </span>
<span class='v MK1_15' data-id='MK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“The time has come, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe the good news.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_16' data-id='MK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was going along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class='v MK1_17' data-id='MK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Come and follow me,”</span> Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“and I will teach you to fish for people.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_18' data-id='MK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They left their nets at once, and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_19' data-id='MK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further, he saw James, Zebedee's son, and his brother John, who were in their boat mending the nets. </span>
<span class='v MK1_20' data-id='MK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jesus called them at once, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the crew, and went after him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_21' data-id='MK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They walked to Capernaum. On the next Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. </span>
<span class='v MK1_22' data-id='MK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught them like one who had authority, and not like the teachers of the Law. </span>
<span class='v MK1_23' data-id='MK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now there was in their synagogue at the time a man under the power of a foul spirit, who called out, </span>
<span class='v MK1_24' data-id='MK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“What do you want with us, Jesus the Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!” </span>
<span class='v MK1_25' data-id='MK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus rebuked the spirit, <span class='wj'>“Be silent! Come out from him.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_26' data-id='MK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The foul spirit threw the man into a fit, and with a loud cry came out from him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_27' data-id='MK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were all so amazed that they kept asking each other, “What is this? What is this, a new kind of teaching? He gives his commands with authority even to the foul spirits, and they obey him!” </span>
<span class='v MK1_28' data-id='MK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>His fame spread at once in all directions, through the whole region of Galilee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_29' data-id='MK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As soon as they had left the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. </span>
<span class='v MK1_30' data-id='MK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying ill with a fever, and they at once told Jesus about her. </span>
<span class='v MK1_31' data-id='MK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus went up to her and, grasping her hand, raised her up; the fever left her, and she began to take care of them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_32' data-id='MK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>In the evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were ill or possessed by demons; </span>
<span class='v MK1_33' data-id='MK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>and the whole city was gathered around the door. </span>
<span class='v MK1_34' data-id='MK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons, and would not permit them to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_35' data-id='MK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>In the morning, long before daylight, Jesus got up and went out to a lonely spot, and there he began to pray. </span>
<span class='v MK1_36' data-id='MK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But Simon and his companions went out searching for him; </span>
<span class='v MK1_37' data-id='MK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and, when they found him, they exclaimed, “Everyone is looking for you!” </span>
<span class='v MK1_38' data-id='MK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Let us go somewhere else, into the country towns nearby so that I can make my proclamation in them also; for that was why I came.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_39' data-id='MK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And he went about making his proclamation in their synagogues all through Galilee, and driving out the demons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_40' data-id='MK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>One day a leper came to Jesus and, falling on his knees, begged him for help. “If only you are willing,” he said, “you are able to make me clean.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_41' data-id='MK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying as he did so, <span class='wj'>“I am willing; become clean.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_42' data-id='MK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Instantly the leprosy left the man, and he became clean; </span>
<span class='v MK1_43' data-id='MK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus, after sternly warning him, immediately sent him away, and said to him, </span>
<span class='v MK1_44' data-id='MK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Be careful not to say anything to anyone; but go and show yourself to the priest, and make the offerings for your cleansing directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK1_45' data-id='MK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>The man, however, went away, and began to speak about it publicly, and to spread the story so widely, that Jesus could no longer go openly into a town, but stayed outside in lonely places; and people came to him from every direction. </span></div></div>
