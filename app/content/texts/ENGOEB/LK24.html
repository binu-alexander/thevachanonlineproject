<span class='v LK24_2' data-id='LK24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb; </span>
<span class='v LK24_3' data-id='LK24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and, on going into it, they could not find the body<span class='note' id='footnote-14'><a href='#note-14' class='key'>*</a></span>. </span>
<span class='v LK24_4' data-id='LK24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>While they were at a loss to account for this, all at once two men stood beside them, in dazzling clothing. </span>
<span class='v LK24_5' data-id='LK24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But, when in their fear the women bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why are you looking among the dead for him who is living? </span>

<span class='v LK24_7' data-id='LK24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>How he said that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of wicked men, and be crucified, and rise again on the third day.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_8' data-id='LK24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then they remembered the words of Jesus, </span>
<span class='v LK24_9' data-id='LK24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and, on returning from the tomb, they told all this to the Eleven and to all the rest. </span>
<span class='v LK24_10' data-id='LK24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>There were Mary of Magdala, and Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James. The other women, too, spoke about this to the apostles. </span>
<span class='v LK24_11' data-id='LK24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>What they said seemed to the apostles mere nonsense, and they did not believe them. </span>

<span class='v LK24_13' data-id='LK24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>It happened that very day that two of the disciples were going to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v LK24_14' data-id='LK24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>talking together, as they went, about all that had just taken place. </span>
<span class='v LK24_15' data-id='LK24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>While they were talking about these things and discussing them, Jesus himself came up and went on their way with them; </span>
<span class='v LK24_16' data-id='LK24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>but their eyes were blinded so that they could not recognize him. </span>
<span class='v LK24_17' data-id='LK24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What is this that you are saying to each other as you walk along?”</span> Jesus asked. They stopped, with sad looks on their faces, </span>
<span class='v LK24_18' data-id='LK24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and then one of them, whose name was Cleopas, said to Jesus, “Are you staying by yourself at Jerusalem, that you have not heard of the things that have happened there within the last few days?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_19' data-id='LK24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What things do you mean?”</span> asked Jesus. “Why, about Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered, “who, in the eyes of God and all the people, was a prophet, whose power was felt in both his words and actions; </span>
<span class='v LK24_20' data-id='LK24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and how the chief priests and our leading men gave him up to be sentenced to death, and afterward crucified him. </span>
<span class='v LK24_21' data-id='LK24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But we were hoping that he was the Destined Deliverer of Israel; yes, and besides all this, it is now three days since these things occurred. </span>
<span class='v LK24_22' data-id='LK24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And what is more, some of the women among us have greatly astonished us. They went to the tomb at daybreak </span>
<span class='v LK24_23' data-id='LK24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And, not finding the body of Jesus there, came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he was alive. </span>
<span class='v LK24_24' data-id='LK24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So some of our number went to the tomb and found everything just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_25' data-id='LK24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Foolish men, slow to accept all that the prophets have said!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_26' data-id='LK24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Was not the Christ bound to undergo this suffering before entering into his glory?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_27' data-id='LK24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then, beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them all through the scriptures the passages that referred to himself. </span>
<span class='v LK24_28' data-id='LK24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When they got near the village to which they were walking, Jesus appeared to be going further; </span>
<span class='v LK24_29' data-id='LK24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but they pressed him not to do so. “Stay with us,” they said, “for it is getting towards evening, and the sun in already low.” So Jesus went in to stay with them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_30' data-id='LK24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>After he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread and said the blessing, and broke it, and gave it to them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_31' data-id='LK24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; but he disappeared from their sight. </span>
<span class='v LK24_32' data-id='LK24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>“How our hearts glowed,” the disciples said to each other, “while he was talking to us on the road, and when he explained the scriptures to us!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_33' data-id='LK24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then they immediately got up and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the Eleven and their companions all together, </span>
<span class='v LK24_34' data-id='LK24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>who told them that the Master had really risen, and had appeared to Simon. </span>
<span class='v LK24_35' data-id='LK24_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So they also related what had happened during their walk, and how they had recognized Jesus at the breaking of the bread. </span>
<span class='v LK24_36' data-id='LK24_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>While they were still talking about these things, Jesus himself stood among them.<span class='note' id='footnote-17'><a href='#note-17' class='key'>§</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_37' data-id='LK24_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>In their terror and alarm they thought they saw a ghost, </span>
<span class='v LK24_38' data-id='LK24_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>but Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why are you so startled? And why do doubts arise in your minds?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_39' data-id='LK24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Look at my hands and my feet, and you will know that it is I. Feel me, and look at me, for a ghost has not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_40' data-id='LK24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> <span class='note' id='footnote-18'><a href='#note-18' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_41' data-id='LK24_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>While they were still unable to believe it all, overcome with joy, and were wondering if it were true, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Have you anything here to eat?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_42' data-id='LK24_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They handed him a piece of broiled fish, </span>
<span class='v LK24_43' data-id='LK24_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and he took it and ate it before their eyes. </span>
<span class='v LK24_44' data-id='LK24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“This is what I told you,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“when I was still with you — that everything that had been written about me in the Law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_45' data-id='LK24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he enabled them to understand the meaning of the scriptures, saying to them, </span>
<span class='v LK24_46' data-id='LK24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Scripture says that the Christ will suffer, and that he will rise again from the dead on the third day,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_47' data-id='LK24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and that repentance for forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed on his authority to all the nations — beginning at Jerusalem.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_48' data-id='LK24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You yourselves are to be witnesses to all this.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK24_49' data-id='LK24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And now I am myself about to send you that which my Father has promised. But you must remain in the city until you have been invested with power from above.”</span> </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_50' data-id='LK24_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and there raised his hands and blessed them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_51' data-id='LK24_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>As he was in the act of blessing them, he left them.<span class='note' id='footnote-19'><a href='#note-19' class='key'>†</a></span> </span>
