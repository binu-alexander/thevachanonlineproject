<span class='v T13_1' data-id='T13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>How true is this saying: ‘To aspire to be to be a supervisor in the church is to be ambitious for a noble task.’ </span>
<span class='v T13_2' data-id='T13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The supervisor should be of blameless character; a faithful partner; living a temperate, discreet, and well-ordered life; hospitable, and a skillful teacher, </span>
<span class='v T13_3' data-id='T13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>not addicted to drink or brawling, but of a forbearing and peaceable disposition, and not a lover of money; </span>
<span class='v T13_4' data-id='T13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>they should provide for own household well, and their children should kept under control and be well-behaved. </span>
<span class='v T13_5' data-id='T13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If someone does not know how to provide for their own household, how can they take charge of the church of God? </span>
<span class='v T13_6' data-id='T13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The supervisor should not be a recent convert, or they might become blinded by pride and fall under the same judgment as the devil. </span>
<span class='v T13_7' data-id='T13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They should also be well spoken of by outsiders, so that they may not incur censure and so fall into the devil's trap. </span>
<span class='v T13_8' data-id='T13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So, too, assistants should be serious and straightforward, not given to taking much drink or to questionable money-making, </span>
<span class='v T13_9' data-id='T13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but people who hold the deep truths of the faith and have a clear conscience. </span>
<span class='v T13_10' data-id='T13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They should be tested first, and only appointed to their office if no objection is raised against them. </span>
<span class='v T13_11' data-id='T13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It should be the same with the women in this office. They should be serious, not gossips, sober, and trustworthy in all respects. </span>
<span class='v T13_12' data-id='T13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>assistants should be faithful partners who manage their children and their households well. </span>
<span class='v T13_13' data-id='T13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Those who have filled that post with honor gain for themselves an honorable position, as well as great confidence through the faith that they place in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
