<div class='s'>In the Fields of Boaz </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_1' data-id='RT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Naomi was related through her husband to a very wealthy man of the family of Elimelech named Boaz. </span>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me now go into the fields and gather leftover grain behind anyone who will allow me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'>“Go, my daughter.” she replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_3' data-id='RT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So she went to glean in the field after the reapers. As it happened, she was in that part of the field which belonged to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. </span>
<span class='v RT2_4' data-id='RT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be with you,” they answered him, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_5' data-id='RT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Whose girl is this?” Boaz asked his servant who had charge of the reapers. </span>
<span class='v RT2_6' data-id='RT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The servant who had charge of the reapers replied, “It is the Moabite girl who came back with Naomi from the territory of Moab. </span>
<span class='v RT2_7' data-id='RT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She asked to be allowed to glean and gather sheaves after the reapers. So she came and has continued to work until now and she has not rested a moment in the field.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_8' data-id='RT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field nor leave this place, but stay here with my girls. </span>
<span class='v RT2_9' data-id='RT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Watch where the men are reaping and follow the gleaners. I have told the young men not to trouble you. When you are thirsty, go to the jars and drink of that which the young men have drawn.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_10' data-id='RT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then she bowed low and said to him, “Why are you so kind to me, to take interest in me when I am just a foreigner?” </span>
<span class='v RT2_11' data-id='RT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Boaz replied, “I have heard what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you left your father and mother and your native land to come to a people that you did not know before. </span>
<span class='v RT2_12' data-id='RT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> repay you for what you have done, and may you be fully rewarded by the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_13' data-id='RT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then she said, “I trust I may please you, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, although I am not really equal to one of your own servants.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_14' data-id='RT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come here and eat some of the food and dip your piece of bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was satisfied and had some left. </span>
<span class='v RT2_15' data-id='RT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When she rose to glean, Boaz gave this order to his young men: “Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not disturb her. </span>
<span class='v RT2_16' data-id='RT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Also pull out some for her from the bundles and leave for her to glean, and do not find fault with her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_17' data-id='RT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So she gleaned in the field until evening, then beat out what she had gleaned. It was about a bushel of barley. </span>
<span class='v RT2_18' data-id='RT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then she took it up and went into the town and showed her mother-in-law what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her that which she had left from her meal after she had had enough. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Where did you glean today, and where did you work?” asked her mother-in-law. “A blessing on him who took notice of you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'>So she told her mother-in-law where she had worked. “The name of the man with whom I worked today,” she said, “is Boaz.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_20' data-id='RT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the blessing of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> rest on this man who has not ceased to show his loving-kindness to the living and to the dead. The man,” she added, “is a near relation of ours.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_21' data-id='RT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“He told me,” Ruth said, “that I must keep near his young men until they have completed all his harvest.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_22' data-id='RT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to Ruth, “It is best, my daughter, that you should go out with his girls because you might not be as safe in another field.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_23' data-id='RT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So she gleaned with the girls of Boaz until the end of the barley and wheat harvest; but she lived with her mother-in-law. </span></div></div>
