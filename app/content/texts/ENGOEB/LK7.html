<span class='v LK7_1' data-id='LK7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had brought to a conclusion all that he had then had to say to the people, he entered Capernaum. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_2' data-id='LK7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A captain in the Roman army had a slave whom he valued, and who was seriously ill — almost at the point of death. </span>
<span class='v LK7_3' data-id='LK7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And, hearing about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, with the request that he would come and save his slave's life. </span>
<span class='v LK7_4' data-id='LK7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they found Jesus, they earnestly implored him to do so. “He deserves the favor from you,” they said, </span>
<span class='v LK7_5' data-id='LK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“For he is devoted to our nation, and himself built our synagogue for us.” </span>
<span class='v LK7_6' data-id='LK7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with them. But, when he was no great distance from the house, the captain sent some friends with the message — “Do not trouble yourself, Sir; for I am unworthy to receive you under my roof. </span>
<span class='v LK7_7' data-id='LK7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>That was why I did not even venture to come to you myself; but speak, and let my manservant be cured. </span>
<span class='v LK7_8' data-id='LK7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.” </span>
<span class='v LK7_9' data-id='LK7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jesus was surprised to hear these words from him; and, turning to the crowd which was following him, he said, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, nowhere in Israel have I met with such faith as this!”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_10' data-id='LK7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And, when the messengers returned to the house, they found the slave recovered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_11' data-id='LK7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Shortly after, Jesus went to a town called Nain, his disciples and a great crowd going with him. </span>
<span class='v LK7_12' data-id='LK7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Just as he approached the gate of the town, there was a dead man being carried out for burial — an only son, and his mother was a widow. A large number of the people of the town were with her. </span>
<span class='v LK7_13' data-id='LK7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When he saw her, the Master was moved with compassion for her, and he said to her, <span class='wj'>“Do not weep.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_14' data-id='LK7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stopped; and Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Young man, I am speaking to you — Rise!”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_15' data-id='LK7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus restored him to his mother. </span>
<span class='v LK7_16' data-id='LK7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Everyone was awe-struck and began praising God. “A great prophet has arisen among us,” they said; “and God has visited his people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_17' data-id='LK7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And this story about Jesus spread all through Judea, and in the neighboring countries as well. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_18' data-id='LK7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>All these events were reported to John by his disciples. </span>
<span class='v LK7_19' data-id='LK7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask — “Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for someone else?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_20' data-id='LK7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When these men found Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask — Are you ‘the coming one,’ or are we to look for somebody else?” </span>
<span class='v LK7_21' data-id='LK7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. </span>
<span class='v LK7_22' data-id='LK7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So his answer to the question was, <span class='wj'>“Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard — the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_23' data-id='LK7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_24' data-id='LK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John, </span>
<span class='v LK7_25' data-id='LK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_26' data-id='LK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_27' data-id='LK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This is the man of whom scripture says —</span> </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK7_27' data-id='LK7_27'><span class='wj'>‘I am sending my messenger ahead of you,</span> </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK7_27' data-id='LK7_27'><span class='wj'>and he will prepare your way before you.’</span> </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK7_28' data-id='LK7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>There is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_29' data-id='LK7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. </span>
<span class='v LK7_30' data-id='LK7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the students of the Law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_31' data-id='LK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“To what then,”</span> Jesus continued, <span class='wj'>“should I compare the people of the present generation? What are they like?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They are like some little children who are sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another — ‘We have played the flute for you, but you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not wept!’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_33' data-id='LK7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For now that John the Baptist has come, not eating bread or drinking wine, you are saying ‘He has a demon in him’;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_34' data-id='LK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and now that the Son of Man has come, eating and drinking, you are saying ‘Here is a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and outcasts.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_35' data-id='LK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And yet wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_36' data-id='LK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to dine with him, so Jesus went to his house and took his place at the table. </span>
<span class='v LK7_37' data-id='LK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Just then a woman, who was an outcast in the town, having heard that Jesus was eating in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster jar of perfume, </span>
<span class='v LK7_38' data-id='LK7_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>and placed herself behind Jesus, near his feet, weeping. Then she began to make his feet wet with her tears, and she dried them with the hair of her head, repeatedly kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfume. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_39' data-id='LK7_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this, he said to himself, “Had this man been ‘the prophet,’ he would have known who, and what sort of woman, this is who is touching him, and that she is an outcast.” </span>
<span class='v LK7_40' data-id='LK7_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But, addressing him, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Simon, I have something to say to you.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_40' data-id='LK7_40'>“Pray do so, teacher,” Simon answered; and Jesus began, </span>
<span class='v LK7_41' data-id='LK7_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“There were two people who were in debt to a moneylender; one owed five hundred silver coins, and the other fifty.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_42' data-id='LK7_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As they were unable to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them, do you think, will love him the more?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_43' data-id='LK7_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>“I suppose,” answered Simon, “it will be the man to whom he forgave the greater debt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_43' data-id='LK7_43'><span class='wj'>“You are right,”</span> said Jesus, </span>
<span class='v LK7_44' data-id='LK7_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>and then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, <span class='wj'>“Do you see this woman? I came into your house — you gave me no water for my feet, but she has made my feet wet with her tears and dried them with her hair.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_45' data-id='LK7_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You did not give me one kiss, but she, from the moment I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_46' data-id='LK7_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You did not anoint even my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_47' data-id='LK7_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So I tell you, her great love shows that her sins, many as they are, have been pardoned. One who is pardoned little loves little.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_48' data-id='LK7_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the woman, <span class='wj'>“Your sins have been pardoned.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK7_49' data-id='LK7_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The other guests began to say to one another, “Who is this man who even pardons sins?” </span>
<span class='v LK7_50' data-id='LK7_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to the woman, <span class='wj'>“Your faith has delivered you; go, and peace be with you.”</span> </span></div></div>
