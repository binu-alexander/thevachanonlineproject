<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_1' data-id='LK22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The feast of the unleavened bread, known as the Passover, was near. </span>
<span class='v LK22_2' data-id='LK22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The chief priest and the teachers of the Law were looking for an opportunity of destroying Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_3' data-id='LK22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Satan took possession of Judas, who was known as Iscariot, and who belonged to the Twelve; </span>
<span class='v LK22_4' data-id='LK22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and he went and discussed with the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple the best way of betraying Jesus to them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_5' data-id='LK22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They were glad of this, and agreed to pay him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_6' data-id='LK22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Judas assented, and looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them, in the absence of a crowd. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_7' data-id='LK22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the day of the Festival of the unleavened bread came, on which the Passover lambs had to be killed, </span>
<span class='v LK22_8' data-id='LK22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent forward Peter and John, saying to them, <span class='wj'>“Go and make preparations for our eating the Passover.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_9' data-id='LK22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Where do you wish us to make preparations?” they asked. </span>
<span class='v LK22_10' data-id='LK22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Listen,”</span> he answered, <span class='wj'>“when you have got into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into whatever house he enters;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_11' data-id='LK22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and you will say to the owner of the house ‘The teacher says to you — Where is the room where I am to eat the Passover with my disciples?’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_12' data-id='LK22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The man will show you a large upstairs room, set out; there make preparations.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_13' data-id='LK22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Peter and John went on, and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_14' data-id='LK22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When the time came, Jesus took his place at the table, and the apostles with him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_15' data-id='LK22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I have most earnestly wished,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_16' data-id='LK22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For I tell you that I will not eat it again, until it has had its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_17' data-id='LK22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then, on receiving a cup, after saying the thanksgiving, he said, <span class='wj'>“Take this and share it among you.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_18' data-id='LK22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For I tell you that I will not, after today, drink of the juice of the grape, until the kingdom of God has come.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_19' data-id='LK22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the thanksgiving, broke it and gave to them, with the words, <span class='wj'>“This is my body.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_20' data-id='LK22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='note' id='footnote-11'><a href='#note-11' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_21' data-id='LK22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet see! The hand of the man who is betraying me is beside me on the table!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_22' data-id='LK22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>True, the Son of Man is passing, by the way ordained for him, yet alas for that man by whom he is being betrayed!”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_23' data-id='LK22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then they began questioning one another which of them it could be who was going to do this. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_24' data-id='LK22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And a dispute arose among them as to which of them was to be regarded as the greatest. </span>
<span class='v LK22_25' data-id='LK22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, said, <span class='wj'>“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their oppressors are styled ‘Benefactors.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_26' data-id='LK22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But with you it must not be so. No, let the greatest among you become like the youngest, and him who leads like him who serves.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_27' data-id='LK22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Which is the greater — the master at the table or his servant? Is not it the master at the table? Yet I myself am among you as one who serves.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_28' data-id='LK22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You are the men who have stood by me in my trials;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_29' data-id='LK22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and, just as my Father has assigned me a kingdom, I assign you places,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_30' data-id='LK22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and be seated on twelve thrones as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_31' data-id='LK22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Simon! Simon! listen. Satan demanded leave to sift you all like wheat,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_32' data-id='LK22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but I prayed for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. And you, when you have returned to me, are to strengthen the others.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_33' data-id='LK22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said Peter, “with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_34' data-id='LK22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I tell you, Peter,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“the cock will not crow today until you have disowned all knowledge of me three times.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them all, <span class='wj'>“When I sent you out as my messengers, without either purse, or bag, or sandals, were you in need of anything?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'>“No; nothing,” they answered. </span>
<span class='v LK22_36' data-id='LK22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Now, however,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“he who has a purse must take it and his bag as well; and he who has not must sell his cloak and buy a sword.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_37' data-id='LK22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, I tell you, that passage of scripture must be fulfilled in me, which says — ‘He was counted among the godless’; indeed all that refers to me is finding its fulfillment.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“Master,” they exclaimed, “look, here are two swords!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'><span class='wj'>“Enough!”</span> said Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_39' data-id='LK22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus then went out, and made his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, followed by his disciples. </span>
<span class='v LK22_40' data-id='LK22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And, when he reached the spot, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Pray that you may not fall into temptation.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_41' data-id='LK22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then he withdrew about a stone's throw, and knelt down and began to pray. </span>
<span class='v LK22_42' data-id='LK22_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Father,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“if it is your pleasure, spare me this cup; only, not my will but your be done.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_43' data-id='LK22_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Presently there appeared to him an angel from heaven, who strengthened him.<span class='note' id='footnote-12'><a href='#note-12' class='key'>†</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_44' data-id='LK22_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And, as his anguish became intense, he prayed still more earnestly, while his sweat was like great drops of blood falling on the ground. </span>
<span class='v LK22_45' data-id='LK22_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he rose from praying, and came to the disciples and found them sleeping for sorrow. </span>
<span class='v LK22_46' data-id='LK22_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why are you asleep?”</span> he asked them. <span class='wj'>“Rise and pray so that you don't fall into temptation.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_47' data-id='LK22_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, a crowd appeared in sight, led by the man called Judas, who was one of the Twelve. Judas approached Jesus, to kiss him; </span>
<span class='v LK22_48' data-id='LK22_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>at which Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Judas, is it by a kiss that you betray the Son of Man?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_49' data-id='LK22_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But when those who were around Jesus saw what was going to happen, they exclaimed, “Master, should we use our swords?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_50' data-id='LK22_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And one of them struck the high priest's servant and cut off his right ear; </span>
<span class='v LK22_51' data-id='LK22_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>at which Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Let me at least do this”; and, touching his ear, he healed the wound.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_52' data-id='LK22_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Then, turning to the chief priests and officers in charge at the Temple and the elders, who had come for him, he said, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_53' data-id='LK22_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When I was with you day after day in the Temple Courts, you did not lay hands on me; but now your time has come, and the power of darkness.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_54' data-id='LK22_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Those who had taken Jesus prisoner took him away into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. </span>
<span class='v LK22_55' data-id='LK22_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>But, when they had lit a fire in the centre of the courtyard and had all sat down there, Peter seated himself in the middle of them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_56' data-id='LK22_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Presently a maidservant saw him sitting near the blaze of the fire. She looked carefully at him and said, “Why, this man was one of his companions!” </span>
<span class='v LK22_57' data-id='LK22_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it. “I do not know him,” he replied. </span>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>A little while afterward someone else — a man — saw him and said, “Why, you are one of them!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'>“No,” Peter said, “I am not.” </span>
<span class='v LK22_59' data-id='LK22_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>About an hour later another man declared positively, “This man also was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean!” </span>
<span class='v LK22_60' data-id='LK22_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, “I do not know what you are speaking about.” Instantly, while he was still speaking, a cock crowed. </span>
<span class='v LK22_61' data-id='LK22_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>And the Master turned and looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the words that the Master had said to him — <span class='wj'>“Before a cock has crowed today, you will disown me three times”;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_62' data-id='LK22_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>and he went outside and wept bitterly. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_63' data-id='LK22_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>The men who held Jesus kept making sport of him and beating him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_64' data-id='LK22_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>They blindfolded him and then questioned him. “Now play the prophet,” they said; “who was it that struck you?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_65' data-id='LK22_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And they heaped many other insults on him. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_66' data-id='LK22_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>At daybreak the the assembly of the elders of the people met — both the chief priests and the teachers of the Law — and took Jesus before their High Council. </span>
<span class='v LK22_67' data-id='LK22_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>“If you are the Christ,” they said, “tell us so.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_67' data-id='LK22_67'><span class='wj'>“If I tell you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“you will not believe me;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_68' data-id='LK22_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and, if I question you, you will not answer.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_69' data-id='LK22_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But from this hour the Son of Man will be seated on the right hand of God Almighty.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_70' data-id='LK22_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>“Are you, then, the Son of God?” they all asked. <span class='wj'>“It is true,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“I am.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK22_71' data-id='LK22_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&nbsp;</span>At this they exclaimed, “Why do we want any more evidence? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!” </span></div></div>
