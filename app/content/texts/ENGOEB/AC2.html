<span class='v AC2_1' data-id='AC2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the course of the Festival at the close of the Harvest the disciples had all met together, </span>
<span class='v AC2_2' data-id='AC2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>when suddenly there came from the heavens a noise like a strong wind rushing by; it filled the whole house in which they were sitting. </span>
<span class='v AC2_3' data-id='AC2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then there appeared tongues of what seemed to be flame, separating, so that one settled on each of them; </span>
<span class='v AC2_4' data-id='AC2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in different languages as the Spirit prompted their utterances. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_5' data-id='AC2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now there were then staying in Jerusalem religious Jews from every country in the world; </span>
<span class='v AC2_6' data-id='AC2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and, when this sound was heard, numbers of people collected, in the greatest excitement, because each of them heard the disciples speaking in his own language. </span>
<span class='v AC2_7' data-id='AC2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They were utterly amazed, and kept asking in astonishment, “What! Are not all these people who are speaking Galileans? </span>
<span class='v AC2_8' data-id='AC2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then how is it that we each of us hear them in our own language? </span>
<span class='v AC2_9' data-id='AC2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Some of us are Parthians, some Medes, some Elamites; and some of us live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Roman Asia, </span>
<span class='v AC2_10' data-id='AC2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the districts of Libya adjoining Cyrene; some of us are visitors from Rome, </span>
<span class='v AC2_11' data-id='AC2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>either Jews by birth or converts, and some are Cretans and Arabians — yet we all alike hear them speaking in our own languages of the great things that God has done.” </span>
<span class='v AC2_12' data-id='AC2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They were all utterly amazed and bewildered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_12' data-id='AC2_12'>“What does it mean?” they asked one another. </span>
<span class='v AC2_13' data-id='AC2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But there were some who said with a sneer, “They have had too much new wine.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_14' data-id='AC2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Peter, surrounded by the eleven other apostles, stood up, and, raising his voice, addressed the crowd. “People of Judea,” he began, “and all you who are staying in Jerusalem, let me tell you what this means. Mark well my words. </span>
<span class='v AC2_15' data-id='AC2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>These people are not drunk, as you suppose; for it is only now nine in the morning! No! </span>
<span class='v AC2_16' data-id='AC2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This is what is spoken of in the prophet Joel — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>‘It will come about in the last days,’ God says, </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>‘That I will pour out my Spirit on all humanity; </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>Your young men will see visions, </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>And your old men dream dreams; </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Yes, even on the slaves — for they are mine — both men and women, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'>I will in those days pour out my Spirit, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'>And they will become prophets; </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I will show wonders in the heavens above, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'>And signs on the earth below — </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'>Blood and fire and mist of smoke; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The sun will become darkness, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'>And the moon blood-red, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'>Before the day of the Lord comes — that great and awful day. </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_21' data-id='AC2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then will everyone who invokes the name of the Lord be saved.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC2_22' data-id='AC2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Jesus of Nazareth, a man whose mission from God to you was proved by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God showed among you through him, as you know full well — </span>
<span class='v AC2_23' data-id='AC2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He, I say, in accordance with God's definite plan and with his previous knowledge, was betrayed, and you, by the hands of lawless men, nailed him to a cross and put him to death. </span>
<span class='v AC2_24' data-id='AC2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But God released him from the pangs of death and raised him to life, it being impossible for death to retain its hold on him. </span>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Indeed he was the one David was referring to when he said — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'>‘I have had the Lord ever before my eyes, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'>For he stands at my right hand, so that I should not be disquieted. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_26' data-id='AC2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Therefore my heart was cheered, and my tongue told its delight; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_26' data-id='AC2_26'>Yes, even my body, too, will rest in hope; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_27' data-id='AC2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_27' data-id='AC2_27'>Nor surrender me, your holy one, to undergo corruption. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_28' data-id='AC2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You have shown me the path to life, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_28' data-id='AC2_28'>You will fill me with gladness in your presence.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC2_29' data-id='AC2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Friends, I can speak to you the more confidently about the patriarch David, because he is dead and buried, and his tomb is here among us to this very day. </span>
<span class='v AC2_30' data-id='AC2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>David, then, prophet as he was, knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to set one of his descendants on his throne, looked into the future, </span>
<span class='v AC2_31' data-id='AC2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and referred to the resurrection of the Christ when he said that he had not been abandoned to Hades, nor had his body undergone corruption. </span>
<span class='v AC2_32' data-id='AC2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>It was this Jesus, whom God raised to life; and of that we are ourselves all witnesses. </span>
<span class='v AC2_33' data-id='AC2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And now that he has been exalted to the right hand of God, and has received from the Father the promised gift of the Holy Spirit, he has begun to pour out that gift, as you yourselves now see and hear. </span>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>It was not David who went up into heaven; for he himself says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'>‘The Lord said to my master, “Sit on my right hand, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_35' data-id='AC2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Until I put your enemies as a footstool under your feet.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC2_36' data-id='AC2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>So let the whole nation of Israel know beyond all doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ — this Jesus whom you crucified.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_37' data-id='AC2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>When the people heard this, they were conscience-smitten, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Friends, what can we do?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_38' data-id='AC2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“Repent,” answered Peter, “and be baptized every one of you in the faith of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC2_39' data-id='AC2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>For the promise is for you and for your children, and also for all those now far away, who may be called by the Lord our God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_40' data-id='AC2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Peter spoke to them for a long time using many other arguments and pleaded with them — “Save yourselves from the perverse spirit of this age.” </span>
<span class='v AC2_41' data-id='AC2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>So those who accepted his teaching were baptized, and about three thousand people joined the disciples on that day alone. </span>
<span class='v AC2_42' data-id='AC2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the Common life of the church, to the breaking of the bread and to the Prayers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_43' data-id='AC2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>A deep impression was made on everyone, and many wonders and signs were done at the hands of the apostles. </span>
<span class='v AC2_44' data-id='AC2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>All who became believers in Christ held everything for the common use; </span>
<span class='v AC2_45' data-id='AC2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>they sold their property and their goods, and shared the proceeds among them all, according to their individual needs. </span>
<span class='v AC2_46' data-id='AC2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the Temple Courts, and to the breaking of bread at their homes, while they partook of their food in simple-hearted gladness, praising God, and winning the goodwill of all the people. </span>
<span class='v AC2_47' data-id='AC2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And the Lord daily added to their company those who were in the path of salvation. </span></div></div>
