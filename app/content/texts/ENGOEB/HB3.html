<span class='v HB3_1' data-id='HB3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my Christian friends, you who, all alike, have received the call from heaven, fix your attention on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our religion. </span>
<span class='v HB3_2' data-id='HB3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>See how faithful he was to the God who appointed him, as Moses was in the whole house of God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_3' data-id='HB3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He has been deemed worthy of far higher honor than Moses, just as the founder of the house is held in greater regard than the house itself. </span>
<span class='v HB3_4' data-id='HB3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For every house has its founder, and the founder of the universe is God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_5' data-id='HB3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>While the faithful service of Moses in the whole house of God was that of a servant, whose duty was to bear testimony to a message still to come, </span>
<span class='v HB3_6' data-id='HB3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>the faithfulness of Christ was that of a son set over the house of God. And we are his house — if only we retain, unshaken to the end, the courage and confidence inspired by our hope. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'>‘If today you hear God's voice, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_8' data-id='HB3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>harden not your hearts, as when Israel provoked me </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_8' data-id='HB3_8'>On the day when they tried my patience in the desert, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_9' data-id='HB3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Where your ancestors tried my forbearance, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_9' data-id='HB3_9'>And saw my mighty deeds for forty years. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I was sorely vexed with that generation, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'>And I said — “Their hearts are always straying; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'>They have never learned my ways”; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_11' data-id='HB3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>While in my wrath I swore — </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_11' data-id='HB3_11'>“They will never enter upon my rest.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB3_12' data-id='HB3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Be careful, friends, that there is never found in anyone of you a wicked and faithless heart, shown by that person separating themselves from the living God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_13' data-id='HB3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Rather encourage one another daily — while there is a today — to prevent anyone among you from being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. </span>
<span class='v HB3_14' data-id='HB3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For we now all share in the Christ, if indeed we retain, unshaken to the end, the confidence that we had at the first. </span>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To use the words of scripture — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'>‘If today you hear God's voice, </span></div>
<div class='q'>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB3_16' data-id='HB3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Who were they who heard God speak and yet provoked him? Were not they all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses? </span>
<span class='v HB3_17' data-id='HB3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And with whom was it that God was sorely vexed for forty years? Was not it with those who had sinned, and who fell dead in the desert? </span>
<span class='v HB3_18' data-id='HB3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And who were they to whom God swore that they should not enter upon his rest, if not those who had proved faithless? </span>
<span class='v HB3_19' data-id='HB3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We see, then, that they failed to enter upon it because of their want of faith. </span></div></div>
