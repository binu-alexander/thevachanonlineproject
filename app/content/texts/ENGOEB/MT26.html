<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_1' data-id='MT26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished teaching all of that, he said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v MT26_2' data-id='MT26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“You know that in two days time the Festival of the Passover will be here; and that the Son of Man is to be given up to be crucified.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_3' data-id='MT26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met in the house of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, </span>
<span class='v MT26_4' data-id='MT26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and plotted together to arrest Jesus by stealth and put him to death; </span>
<span class='v MT26_5' data-id='MT26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but they said, “Not during the Festival, or the people may riot.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_6' data-id='MT26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had reached Bethany, and while he was in the house of Simon the leper, </span>
<span class='v MT26_7' data-id='MT26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>a woman came up to him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and poured the perfume on his head as he sat at the table. </span>
<span class='v MT26_8' data-id='MT26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The disciples were indignant at seeing this. “What is this waste for?” they exclaimed. </span>
<span class='v MT26_9' data-id='MT26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“It could have been sold for a large sum, and the money given to poor people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_10' data-id='MT26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why are you troubling the woman?”</span> Jesus said, when he noticed it. <span class='wj'>“For this is a beautiful deed that she has done to me.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_11' data-id='MT26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_12' data-id='MT26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In pouring this perfume on my body, she has done it for my burying.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_13' data-id='MT26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, wherever, in the whole world, this good news is proclaimed, what this woman has done will be told in memory of her.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_14' data-id='MT26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>It was then that one of the Twelve, named Judas Iscariot, made his way to the chief priests, </span>
<span class='v MT26_15' data-id='MT26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and said “What are you willing to give me, if I betray Jesus to you?” The Priests weighed him out thirty pieces of silver as payment. </span>
<span class='v MT26_16' data-id='MT26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So from that time Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_17' data-id='MT26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the Festival of the unleavened bread, the disciples came up to Jesus, and said, “Where do you wish us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_18' data-id='MT26_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Go into the city to a certain man,”</span> he answered, <span class='wj'>“and say to him ‘The teacher says — My time is near. I will keep the Passover with my disciples at your house.’ ”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_19' data-id='MT26_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The disciples did as Jesus directed them, and prepared the Passover. </span>
<span class='v MT26_20' data-id='MT26_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In the evening Jesus took his place with the twelve disciples, </span>
<span class='v MT26_21' data-id='MT26_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and, while they were eating, he said, <span class='wj'>“I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_22' data-id='MT26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In great grief they began to say to him, one by one, “Can it be I, Master?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_23' data-id='MT26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“The one who dipped his bread beside me in the dish,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“is the one who will betray me.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_24' data-id='MT26_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>True, the Son of Man must go, as scripture says of him, yet alas for that man by whom the Son of Man is being betrayed! For that man it would be better never to have been born!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_25' data-id='MT26_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Judas, who was betraying him, turned to him and said, “Can it be I, Rabbi?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_25' data-id='MT26_25'><span class='wj'>“It is,”</span> answered Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_26' data-id='MT26_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and, after saying the blessing, broke it and, as he gave it to his disciples, said, <span class='wj'>“Take it and eat it; this is my body.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_27' data-id='MT26_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he took a cup, and, after saying the thanksgiving, gave it to them, with the words, <span class='wj'>“Drink from it, all of you;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_28' data-id='MT26_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for this is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_29' data-id='MT26_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you that I will never, after this, drink of this juice of the grape, until that day when I will drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_30' data-id='MT26_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They then sang a hymn, and went out to the Mount of Olives. </span>
<span class='v MT26_31' data-id='MT26_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Even you will all fall away from me tonight. Scripture says — ‘I will strike down the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_32' data-id='MT26_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_33' data-id='MT26_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“If everyone else falls away from you,” Peter answered, “I will never fall away!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_34' data-id='MT26_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I tell you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“that this very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_35' data-id='MT26_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“Even if I must die with you,” Peter exclaimed, “I will never disown you!” All the disciples spoke in the same way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_36' data-id='MT26_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came with them to a garden called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Sit down here while I go and pray over there.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_37' data-id='MT26_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to show signs of sadness and deep distress of mind. </span>
<span class='v MT26_38' data-id='MT26_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I am sad at heart,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“sad even to death; wait here and watch with me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_39' data-id='MT26_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Going on a little further, he threw himself on his face in prayer. <span class='wj'>“My Father,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“if it is possible, let me be spared this cup; only, not as I will, but as you will.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_40' data-id='MT26_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep. <span class='wj'>“What!”</span> he said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“could none of you watch with me for one hour?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_41' data-id='MT26_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Watch and pray so that you don't fall into temptation. True, the spirit is eager, but human nature is weak.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_42' data-id='MT26_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Again, a second time, he went away, and prayed. <span class='wj'>“My Father,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“if I cannot be spared this cup, but must drink it, your will be done!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_43' data-id='MT26_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And coming back again he found them asleep, for their eyes were heavy. </span>
<span class='v MT26_44' data-id='MT26_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>So he left them, and went away again, and prayed a third time, again saying the same words. </span>
<span class='v MT26_45' data-id='MT26_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he came to the disciples, and said, <span class='wj'>“Sleep on now, and rest yourselves. Look - my time is close at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of wicked people.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_46' data-id='MT26_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Up, and let us be going. Look! My betrayer is close at hand.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_47' data-id='MT26_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And, while he was still speaking, Judas, who was one of the Twelve, came in sight; and with him was a great crowd of people, with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people. </span>
<span class='v MT26_48' data-id='MT26_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them. “The man whom I kiss,” he had said, “will be the one; arrest him.” </span>
<span class='v MT26_49' data-id='MT26_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>So he went up to Jesus at once, and exclaimed, “Welcome, Rabbi!” and kissed him; </span>
<span class='v MT26_50' data-id='MT26_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>at which Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Friend, do what you have come for.”</span> The men went up, seized Jesus, and arrested him. </span>
<span class='v MT26_51' data-id='MT26_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Suddenly one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and striking the high priest's servant, cut off his ear. </span>
<span class='v MT26_52' data-id='MT26_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Sheathe your sword,”</span> Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“for all who draw the sword will be put to the sword.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_53' data-id='MT26_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Do you think that I cannot ask my Father for help, when he would at once send to my aid more than twelve legions of angels?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_54' data-id='MT26_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But in that case how would the scriptures be fulfilled, which say that this must be?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_55' data-id='MT26_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Jesus at the same time said to the crowds, <span class='wj'>“Have you come out, as if after a robber, with swords and clubs, to take me? I have sat teaching day after day in the Temple Courts, and yet you did not arrest me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_56' data-id='MT26_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>The whole of this occurred in fulfillment of the Prophetic scriptures. Then the disciples all forsook him and fled. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_57' data-id='MT26_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the Law and elders had assembled. </span>
<span class='v MT26_58' data-id='MT26_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the offices, to see the end. </span>
<span class='v MT26_59' data-id='MT26_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the chief priests and the whole of the High Council were trying to get such false evidence against Jesus, as would warrant putting him to death, </span>
<span class='v MT26_60' data-id='MT26_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>but they did not find any, although many came forward with false evidence. Later on, however, two men came forward and said, </span>
<span class='v MT26_61' data-id='MT26_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>“This man said ‘I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three days.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MT26_62' data-id='MT26_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest stood up, and said to Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this evidence which these men are giving against you?” </span>
<span class='v MT26_63' data-id='MT26_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I order you, by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_64' data-id='MT26_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“It is true,”</span> Jesus answered; <span class='wj'>“Moreover I tell you all that hereafter you will see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of the heavens.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT26_65' data-id='MT26_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest tore his robes. “This is blasphemy!” he exclaimed. “Why do we want any more witnesses? You have just heard his blasphemy! </span>
<span class='v MT26_66' data-id='MT26_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>What is your decision?” They answered, “He deserves death.” </span>
<span class='v MT26_67' data-id='MT26_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>Then they spat in his face, and struck him, while others dealt blows at him, saying as they did so, </span>
<span class='v MT26_68' data-id='MT26_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>“Now play the prophet for us, you Christ! Who was it that struck you?” </span>
<span class='v MT26_69' data-id='MT26_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span>Peter, meanwhile, was sitting outside in the courtyard; and a maidservant came up to him, and exclaimed, “Why, you were with Jesus the Galilean!” </span>
<span class='v MT26_70' data-id='MT26_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>But Peter denied it before them all. “I do not know what you mean,” he replied. </span>
<span class='v MT26_71' data-id='MT26_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&nbsp;</span>When he had gone out into the gateway, another maid saw him, and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth!” </span>
<span class='v MT26_72' data-id='MT26_72'><span class='v-num v-72'>72&nbsp;</span>Again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!” </span>
<span class='v MT26_73' data-id='MT26_73'><span class='v-num v-73'>73&nbsp;</span>But soon afterward those who were standing by came up and said to Peter, “You also are certainly one of them; why, even your way of speaking proves it!” </span>
<span class='v MT26_74' data-id='MT26_74'><span class='v-num v-74'>74&nbsp;</span>Then Peter said, “I swear that I do not know the man! May God punish me if I am lying!” At that moment a cock crowed; </span>
<span class='v MT26_75' data-id='MT26_75'><span class='v-num v-75'>75&nbsp;</span>and Peter remembered the words which Jesus had said — <span class='wj'>‘Before a cock has crowed, you will disown me three times’;</span> and he went outside, and wept bitterly. </span></div></div>
