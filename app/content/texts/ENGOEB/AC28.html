<span class='v AC28_1' data-id='AC28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When we were all safe, we found that the island was called Malta. </span>
<span class='v AC28_2' data-id='AC28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The island's people showed us marked kindness, for they lit a fire and took us all under shelter, because it had come on to rain and was cold. </span>
<span class='v AC28_3' data-id='AC28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Paul had gathered a quantity of dry sticks and laid them on the fire, when a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, fastened on his hand. </span>
<span class='v AC28_4' data-id='AC28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the islanders saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “Evidently this man is a murderer, for though he has been saved from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.” </span>
<span class='v AC28_5' data-id='AC28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>However, Paul shook the creature off into the fire and took no harm. </span>
<span class='v AC28_6' data-id='AC28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The islanders were expecting inflammation to set in, or that he would suddenly fall dead; but, after waiting for a long time, and seeing that there was nothing amiss with him, they changed their minds and said that he was a God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_7' data-id='AC28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In that region there was an estate belonging to the Governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He took us up to his house, and for three days entertained us most courteously. </span>
<span class='v AC28_8' data-id='AC28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>It happened that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him; and, after praying, he placed his hands on him and cured him. </span>
<span class='v AC28_9' data-id='AC28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After this, all the people in the island who had any illness came to Paul, and were cured. </span>
<span class='v AC28_10' data-id='AC28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They also presented us with many gifts, and when we set sail they put supplies of necessaries on board. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_11' data-id='AC28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>After three months, we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island. She was an Alexandrian vessel, and had the Twin sons of Zeus for her figure-head. </span>
<span class='v AC28_12' data-id='AC28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>We put in at Syracuse and stayed there three days, </span>
<span class='v AC28_13' data-id='AC28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and from there we worked to windward and so got to Rhegium. A day later a south wind sprang up and took us to Puteoli in two days. </span>
<span class='v AC28_14' data-id='AC28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>There we found some of the Lord's followers, and were urged to stay a week with them; after which we went on to Rome. </span>
<span class='v AC28_15' data-id='AC28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The followers there had heard about us, and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At sight of them Paul thanked God and was much cheered. </span>
<span class='v AC28_16' data-id='AC28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>On our reaching Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself, except for the soldier who was in charge of him. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_17' data-id='AC28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Three days after our arrival, Paul invited the leading Jews to meet him; and, when they came, he said, “Brothers, although I had done nothing hostile to the interests of our nation or to our ancestral customs, yet I was sent from Jerusalem as a prisoner, and handed over to the Romans. </span>
<span class='v AC28_18' data-id='AC28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Romans, when they had examined me, were ready to release me, because there was nothing in my conduct deserving death. </span>
<span class='v AC28_19' data-id='AC28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But, as the Jewish leaders opposed my release, I was compelled to appeal to the Emperor — not, indeed, that I had any charge to make against my own nation. </span>
<span class='v AC28_20' data-id='AC28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>This, then, is my reason for urging you to come to see me and talk with me; because it is for the sake of the hope of Israel that I am here in chains.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_21' data-id='AC28_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“We,” was their reply, “have not had any letter about you from Judea, nor have any of our fellow Jews come and reported or said anything bad about you. </span>
<span class='v AC28_22' data-id='AC28_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But we will be glad to hear from you what your views are, for, with regard to this sect, we are well aware that it is spoken against on all sides.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_23' data-id='AC28_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They then fixed a day with him, and came to the place where he was staying, in even larger numbers, when Paul proceeded to lay the subject before them. He bore his testimony to the kingdom of God, and tried to convince them about Jesus, by arguments drawn from the Law of Moses and from the prophets — speaking from morning until evening. </span>
<span class='v AC28_24' data-id='AC28_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Some were inclined to accept what he said; others, however, rejected it. </span>
<span class='v AC28_25' data-id='AC28_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So, as they disagreed among themselves, they began to disperse, Paul adding only — </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC28_25' data-id='AC28_25'>“True, indeed, was the declaration made by the Holy Spirit, through the prophet Isaiah to your ancestors — </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC28_27' data-id='AC28_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For the mind of this nation has grown dense, </span></div>

<span class='v AC28_27' data-id='AC28_27'>Otherwise some day they might see with their eyes, </span></div>

<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC28_27' data-id='AC28_27'>And I might heal them. </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC28_28' data-id='AC28_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Understand, then, that this salvation of God was sent for the Gentiles; and they will listen.” </span>

<span class='v AC28_30' data-id='AC28_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For two whole years Paul stayed in a house which he rented for himself, welcoming all who came to see him, </span>
<span class='v AC28_31' data-id='AC28_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ, with perfect fearlessness, unhindered. </span></div></div>
