<span class='v P15_1' data-id='P15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As for the older ones among you, who are elders in the church, I, their fellow elder, and a witness to the sufferings of the Christ, who will also share in the glory that is to be revealed — </span>
<span class='v P15_2' data-id='P15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I beg you to be true shepherds of the flock of God among you, not because you are compelled, but of your own free will; not from a base love of gain, but with a ready spirit; </span>
<span class='v P15_3' data-id='P15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>not as lords of your charges, but as examples to your flock. </span>
<span class='v P15_4' data-id='P15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then, when the chief shepherd appears, you will win the crown of glory that never fades. </span>
<span class='v P15_5' data-id='P15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Again, you younger ones should show deference to the older. And all of you should put on the badge of humility in mutual service, for ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives his help to the humble.’ </span></div>

<span class='v P15_6' data-id='P15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, so that he may exalt you in his good time, </span>
<span class='v P15_7' data-id='P15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>laying all your anxieties on him, for he makes you his care. </span>
<span class='v P15_8' data-id='P15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Exercise self-control, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, like a roaring lion, is prowling about, eager to devour you. </span>
<span class='v P15_9' data-id='P15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Stand firm against him, strong in your faith; knowing, as you do, that the sufferings which you are undergoing are being endured to the full by the Lord's followers throughout the world. </span>
<span class='v P15_10' data-id='P15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>God, from whom all help comes, and who called you, by your union with Christ, into his eternal glory, will, when you have suffered for a little while, himself perfect, establish, strengthen you. </span>
<span class='v P15_11' data-id='P15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>To him be ascribed dominion for ever. Amen. </span></div>

<span class='v P15_12' data-id='P15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I have been writing to you briefly by the hand of Silas, our true-hearted friend (for so I regard him), to encourage you, and to bear my testimony that in what I have written is to be found the true love of God. On that take your stand. </span>
<span class='v P15_13' data-id='P15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Your sister church in ‘Babylon’ sends you greeting, and so does Mark, who is as a son to me. </span>
<span class='v P15_14' data-id='P15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Greet one another with the kiss of love. </span></div>
