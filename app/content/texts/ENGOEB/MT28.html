<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_1' data-id='MT28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary had gone to look at the grave, </span>
<span class='v MT28_2' data-id='MT28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>when suddenly a great earthquake occurred. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and seated himself on it. </span>
<span class='v MT28_3' data-id='MT28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was as dazzling as lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow; </span>
<span class='v MT28_4' data-id='MT28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and, in their terror of him, the men on guard trembled violently and became like dead men. </span>
<span class='v MT28_5' data-id='MT28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the angel, addressing the women, said, “You need not be afraid. I know that it is Jesus, who was crucified, for whom you are looking. </span>
<span class='v MT28_6' data-id='MT28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is not here; for he has risen, as he said he would. Come, and see the place where he was lying; </span>
<span class='v MT28_7' data-id='MT28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and then go quickly and say to his disciples ‘He has risen from the dead, and is going before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Remember, I have told you.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_8' data-id='MT28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They left the tomb quickly, in awe and great joy, and ran to tell the news to the disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT28_9' data-id='MT28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Suddenly Jesus met them. <span class='wj'>“Welcome!”</span> he said. The women went up to him, and clasped his feet, bowing to the ground before him. Then Jesus said to them, </span>
<span class='v MT28_10' data-id='MT28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers and sisters to set out for Galilee, and they will see me there.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT28_11' data-id='MT28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>While they were still on their way, some of the guard came into the city, and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. </span>
<span class='v MT28_12' data-id='MT28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So they and the elders met and, after holding a consultation, gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, </span>
<span class='v MT28_13' data-id='MT28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and told them to say that his disciples came in the night, and stole him while they were asleep; </span>
<span class='v MT28_14' data-id='MT28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“And should this matter come before the Governor,” they added, “we will satisfy him, and see that you have nothing to fear.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_15' data-id='MT28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were instructed. This story spread widely; the people of Judea still tell it today. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_16' data-id='MT28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus told them to meet him; </span>
<span class='v MT28_17' data-id='MT28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and, when they saw him, they bowed to the ground before him; although some felt doubtful. </span>
<span class='v MT28_18' data-id='MT28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came up, and spoke to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“All authority in heaven and on the earth has been given to me.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT28_19' data-id='MT28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the faith of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,</span> </span>
<span class='v MT28_20' data-id='MT28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and teaching them to lay to heart all the commands that I have given you; and, remember, I myself am with you every day until the close of the age.”</span> </span></div></div>
