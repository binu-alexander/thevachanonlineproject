<span class='v JN15_1' data-id='JN15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vine-grower.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_2' data-id='JN15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Any unfruitful branch in me he takes away, and he cleanses every fruitful branch, so that it may bear more fruit.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_3' data-id='JN15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You are already clean because of the message that I have given you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_4' data-id='JN15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Remain united to me, and I will remain united to you. As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it remains united to the vine; no more can you, unless you remain united to me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_5' data-id='JN15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am the vine, you are the branches. If you remains united to me, while I remain united to you — you bear fruit plentifully; for you can do nothing apart from me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_6' data-id='JN15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone does not remain united to me, they are thrown away, as a branch would be, and withers up. Such branches are collected and thrown into the fire, and are burnt.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_7' data-id='JN15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If you remain united to me, and my teaching remains in your hearts, ask whatever you wish, and it will be yours.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_8' data-id='JN15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It is by your bearing fruit plentifully, and so showing yourselves my disciples, that my Father is honored.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_9' data-id='JN15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; remain in my love.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_10' data-id='JN15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If you lay my commands to heart, you will remain in my love; just as I have laid the Father's commands to heart and remain in his love.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_11' data-id='JN15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have told you all this so that my own joy may be yours, and that your joy may be complete.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_12' data-id='JN15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This is my command — love one another, as I have loved you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_13' data-id='JN15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No one can give greater proof of love than by laying down their life for their friends.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_14' data-id='JN15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And you are my friends, if you do what I command you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_15' data-id='JN15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I no longer call you ‘servants,’ because a servant does not know what their master is doing; but I have given you the name of ‘friends,’ because I made known to you everything that I learned from my Father.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_16' data-id='JN15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It wasn't you who chose me, but I who chose you, and I appointed you to go and bear fruit — fruit that should remain, so that the Father might grant you whatever you ask in my name.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_17' data-id='JN15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am giving you these commands that you may love one another.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_18' data-id='JN15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If the world hates you, you know that it has first hated me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_19' data-id='JN15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If you belonged to the world, the world would love its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world — that is why the world hates you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_20' data-id='JN15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Remember what I said to you — ‘A servant is not greater than their master.’ If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have laid my message to heart, they will lay yours to heart also.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_21' data-id='JN15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But they will do all this to you, because you believe in my name, for they do not know him who sent me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_22' data-id='JN15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have had no sin to answer for; but as it is, they have no excuse for their sin.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_23' data-id='JN15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The person who hates me hates my Father also.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_24' data-id='JN15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If I had not done among them such work as no one else ever did, they would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_25' data-id='JN15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And so is fulfilled what is said in their Law — ‘They hated me without cause.’</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_26' data-id='JN15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, when the helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father — the Spirit of truth, who comes from the Father — will bear testimony to me;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN15_27' data-id='JN15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>yes, and you also are to bear testimony, because you have been with me from the first.</span> </span></div></div>
