<div class='s'>The Work in Judaea, Galilee and Samaria </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_1' data-id='JN2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Two days after this there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there. </span>
<span class='v JN2_2' data-id='JN2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jesus himself, too, with his disciples, was invited to the wedding. </span>
<span class='v JN2_3' data-id='JN2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And, when the wine ran short, his mother said to him, “They have no wine left.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_4' data-id='JN2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What do you want with me?”</span> answered Jesus. <span class='wj'>“My time has not come yet.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN2_5' data-id='JN2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” </span>
<span class='v JN2_6' data-id='JN2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There were standing there six stone water-jars, in accordance with the Jewish rule of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_7' data-id='JN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the servants, <span class='wj'>“Fill the water-jars with water.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN2_8' data-id='JN2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And, when they had filled them to the brim, he added, <span class='wj'>“Now take some out, and carry it to the Master of the feast.”</span> The servants did so. </span>
<span class='v JN2_9' data-id='JN2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And, when the Master of the feast had tasted the water which had now become wine, not knowing where it had come from — although the servants who had taken out the water knew — </span>
<span class='v JN2_10' data-id='JN2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He called the groom and said to him, “Everyone puts good wine on the table first, and inferior wine afterward, when his guests have drunk freely; but you have kept back the good wine till now!” </span>
<span class='v JN2_11' data-id='JN2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This, the first sign of his mission, Jesus gave at Cana in Galilee, and by it revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_12' data-id='JN2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum — he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; but they stayed there only a few days. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_13' data-id='JN2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then, as the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JN2_14' data-id='JN2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the Temple Courts he found people who were selling bullocks, sheep, and pigeons, and the money changers at their counters. </span>
<span class='v JN2_15' data-id='JN2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the Temple Courts, and the sheep and bullocks as well; he scattered the money of the money changers, and overturned their tables, </span>
<span class='v JN2_16' data-id='JN2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and said to the pigeon-dealers, <span class='wj'>“Take these things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market house.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN2_17' data-id='JN2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>His disciples remembered that scripture said — ‘Passion for your house will consume me.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_18' data-id='JN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then some of the religious authorities asked Jesus, “What sign are you going to show us, since you act in this way?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_19' data-id='JN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Destroy this temple,”</span> was his answer, <span class='wj'>“and I will raise it in three days.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_20' data-id='JN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“This Temple,” the authorities replied, “has been forty-six years in building, and are you going to ‘raise it in three days’?” </span>
<span class='v JN2_21' data-id='JN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But Jesus was speaking of his body as a temple. </span>
<span class='v JN2_22' data-id='JN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Afterward, when he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the passage of scripture, and the words which Jesus had spoken. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_23' data-id='JN2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was in Jerusalem, during the Passover Festival, many came to trust in him, when they saw the signs of his mission that he was giving. </span>
<span class='v JN2_24' data-id='JN2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus did not put himself in their power because he knew what was in their hearts. </span>
<span class='v JN2_25' data-id='JN2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He did not need anyone to tell him about people because he could read what was in them. </span></div></div>
