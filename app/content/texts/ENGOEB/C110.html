<span class='v C110_1' data-id='C110_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I want you to bear in mind, friends, that all our ancestors were beneath the cloud, and all passed through the sea; </span>
<span class='v C110_2' data-id='C110_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that in the cloud and in the sea they all underwent baptism as followers of Moses; </span>
<span class='v C110_3' data-id='C110_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and that they all ate the same supernatural food, </span>
<span class='v C110_4' data-id='C110_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and all drank the same supernatural water, for they used to drink from a supernatural rock which followed them, and that rock was the Christ. </span>
<span class='v C110_5' data-id='C110_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Yet with most of them God was displeased; for they were struck down in the desert. </span>
<span class='v C110_6' data-id='C110_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now these things happened as warnings to us, to teach us not to long for evil things as our ancestors longed. </span>
<span class='v C110_7' data-id='C110_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not become idolaters, as some of them became. Scripture says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C110_7' data-id='C110_7'>‘The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v C110_8' data-id='C110_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Nor let us act immorally, as some of them acted, with the result that twenty-three thousand of them fell dead in a single day. </span>
<span class='v C110_9' data-id='C110_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Nor let us try the patience of the Lord too far, as some of them tried it, with the result that they were, one after another, destroyed by the snakes. </span>
<span class='v C110_10' data-id='C110_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And do not murmur, as some of them murmured, and so were destroyed by the angel of death. </span>
<span class='v C110_11' data-id='C110_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>These things happened to them by way of warning, and were recorded to serve as a caution to us, in whose days the close of the ages has come. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C110_12' data-id='C110_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore let the person who thinks that they stand take care that they do not fall. </span>
<span class='v C110_13' data-id='C110_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>No temptation has come upon you that is not common to all humanity. God will not fail you, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength; but, when he sends the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, so that you may have strength to endure. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v C110_14' data-id='C110_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my dear friends, shun the worship of idols. </span>
<span class='v C110_15' data-id='C110_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I speak to you as man of discernment; form your own judgment about what I am saying. </span>
<span class='v C110_16' data-id='C110_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the cup of blessing which we bless, is not there a sharing in the blood of the Christ? And in the bread which we break, is not there a sharing in the body of the Christ? </span>
<span class='v C110_17' data-id='C110_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The bread is one, and we, though many, are one body; for we all partake of that one bread. </span>
<span class='v C110_18' data-id='C110_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Look at the people of Israel. Do not those who eat the sacrifices share with the altar? </span>
<span class='v C110_19' data-id='C110_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>What do I mean? That an offering made to an idol, or the idol itself, is anything? </span>
<span class='v C110_20' data-id='C110_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>No; what I say is that the sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are offered to demons and to a being who is no God, and I do not want you to share with demons. </span>
<span class='v C110_21' data-id='C110_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You cannot drink both the Cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake at the Table of the Lord and at the table of demons. </span>
<span class='v C110_22' data-id='C110_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Or are we to rouse the jealousy of the Lord? Are we stronger than he? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C110_23' data-id='C110_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable! Yes, but everything does not build up character. </span>
<span class='v C110_24' data-id='C110_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>A person must not study their own interests, but the interests of others. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C110_25' data-id='C110_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Eat anything that is sold in the market, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples; </span>
<span class='v C110_26' data-id='C110_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>for the earth, with all that is in it, belongs to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C110_27' data-id='C110_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you consent to go, eat anything that is put before you, without making inquiries to satisfy your scruples. </span>
<span class='v C110_28' data-id='C110_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But, if anyone should say to you ‘This has been offered in sacrifice to an idol,’ then, for the sake of the speaker and his scruples, do not eat it. </span>
<span class='v C110_29' data-id='C110_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I do not say your scruples, but his. For why should the freedom that I claim be condemned by the scruples of another? </span>
<span class='v C110_30' data-id='C110_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If, for my part, I take the food thankfully, why should I be abused for eating that for which I give thanks? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C110_31' data-id='C110_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do everything to the honor of God. </span>
<span class='v C110_32' data-id='C110_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Do not cause offense either to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God; </span>
<span class='v C110_33' data-id='C110_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>for I, also, try to please everybody in everything, not seeking my own advantage, but do what is best for others, so that they may be saved. </span></div></div>
