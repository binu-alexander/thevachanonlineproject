<div class='s'>Introduction </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_1' data-id='TT1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>From Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, on behalf of the faith of God's chosen people, and their knowledge of that truth which makes for godliness </span>
<span class='v TT1_2' data-id='TT1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>— and is based on the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began, </span>
<span class='v TT1_3' data-id='TT1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and has revealed at his own time in his message, with the preaching of which I was entrusted by the command of God our Savior. </span>
<span class='v TT1_4' data-id='TT1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>To Titus, my true child in our shared faith: May God, the Father, and Christ Jesus, our Savior, bless you and give you peace. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Mission of Titus in Crete </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_5' data-id='TT1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My reason for leaving you in Crete was that you might put in order what had been left unfinished, and appoint church elders in the various towns, as I myself directed you. </span>
<span class='v TT1_6' data-id='TT1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They are to be of irreproachable character, faithful to their partners, whose children are believers in Christ and have never been open to the charge of being wild or unruly. </span>
<span class='v TT1_7' data-id='TT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For a supervisor, as God's steward, ought to be of blameless character — not arrogant or quick-tempered, not given to drunkeness, violence or shady money-making. </span>
<span class='v TT1_8' data-id='TT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Instead, they should be hospitable, love what is good, self-controlled, upright, people of holy life and disciplined, </span>
<span class='v TT1_9' data-id='TT1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught — so that they may be able to encourage others by sound teaching, as well as to refute those who contradict it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_10' data-id='TT1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For there are many undisciplined persons who lead others astray with their nonsense, especially those of the group advocating the necessity of circumcision. </span>
<span class='v TT1_11' data-id='TT1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They need to be kept quiet as they disrupt whole households by teaching what they ought not to teach, simply to make shameful financial gain. </span>
<span class='v TT1_12' data-id='TT1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It was a Cretan — one of their own prophets — who said: ‘Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.’ This statement is true. </span>
<span class='v TT1_13' data-id='TT1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith, </span>
<span class='v TT1_14' data-id='TT1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and may pay no attention to Jewish legends, or to the directions of those who turn their backs on the truth. </span>
<span class='v TT1_15' data-id='TT1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To those whose minds are pure, all things are ritually pure, but to those whose minds are tainted and unbelieving nothing is pure, as their minds and consciences are alike polluted. </span>
<span class='v TT1_16' data-id='TT1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable and disobedient and useless for any good work. </span></div></div>
