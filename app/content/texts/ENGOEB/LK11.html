<span class='v LK11_5' data-id='LK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jesus also said to them, <span class='wj'>“Suppose that one of you who has a friend were to go to him in the middle of the night and say ‘Friend, lend me three loaves,</span> </span>

<span class='v LK11_14' data-id='LK11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Once Jesus was driving out a dumb demon, and, when the demon had gone out, the dumb man spoke. The people were amazed at this; </span>
<span class='v LK11_15' data-id='LK11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>but some of them said, “He drives out demons by the help of Beelzebul, the chief of the demons”; </span>
<span class='v LK11_16' data-id='LK11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>while others, to test him, asked him for some sign from the heavens. </span>
<span class='v LK11_17' data-id='LK11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus himself, however, was aware of what they were thinking, and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Any kingdom wholly divided against itself becomes a desolation; and a divided house falls.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_18' data-id='LK11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, too, if Satan is wholly divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? Yet you say that I drive out demons by the help of Beelzebul.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_19' data-id='LK11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, if it is by Beelzebul's help that I drive out demons, by whose help is it that your own sons drive them out? Therefore they will themselves be your judges.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_20' data-id='LK11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, if it is by the hand of God that I drive out demons, then the kingdom of God must already be upon you.</span> </span>

<span class='v LK11_22' data-id='LK11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, when one still stronger has attacked and overpowered him, he takes away all the weapons on which the other had relied, and divides his spoil.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_23' data-id='LK11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Whoever who is not with me is against me, and the person who does not help me to gather is scattering.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_24' data-id='LK11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No sooner does a foul spirit leave someone, than it passes through places where there is no water, in search of rest; and finding none, it says ‘I will go back to the home which I left’;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_25' data-id='LK11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, on coming there, it finds it unoccupied, swept, and put in order.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_26' data-id='LK11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in, and make their home there; and the last state of that person proves to be worse than the first.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_27' data-id='LK11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd, raising her voice, exclaimed, “Happy was the mother who bore you and nursed you!” </span>
<span class='v LK11_28' data-id='LK11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Rather, happy are those who listen to God's message and keep it.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK11_29' data-id='LK11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As the crowds increased, Jesus began to speak, <span class='wj'>“This generation is a wicked generation. It is asking a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_30' data-id='LK11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.</span> </span>

<span class='v LK11_32' data-id='LK11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>At the judgment the men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation, and will condemn it, because they repented at Jonah's proclamation; and here is more than a Jonah!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_33' data-id='LK11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No one sets light to a lamp, and then puts it in the cellar or under a basket, but he puts it on the lamp-stand, so that anyone who comes in may see the light.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_34' data-id='LK11_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is unclouded, your whole body, also, is lit up; but, as soon as your eye is diseased, your body, also, is darkened.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_35' data-id='LK11_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Take care, therefore, that the inner light is not darkness.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_36' data-id='LK11_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If, then, your whole body is lit up, and no corner of it darkened, the whole will be lit up, just as when a lamp gives you light by its brilliance.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK11_37' data-id='LK11_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>As Jesus finished speaking, a Pharisee asked him to breakfast with him, and Jesus went in and took his place at the table. </span>
<span class='v LK11_38' data-id='LK11_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The Pharisee noticed, to his astonishment, that Jesus omitted the ceremonial washing before breakfast. </span>
<span class='v LK11_39' data-id='LK11_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>But the Master said to him, <span class='wj'>“You Pharisees do, it is true, clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside you yourselves are filled with greed and wickedness.</span> </span>

<span class='v LK11_42' data-id='LK11_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But alas for you Pharisees! You pay tithes on mint, rue, and herbs of all kinds, and pass over justice and love to God. These last you ought to have put into practice without neglecting the first.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_43' data-id='LK11_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Alas for you Pharisees! You delight to have the front seat in the synagogues, and to be greeted in the markets with respect.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_44' data-id='LK11_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Alas for you! You are like unsuspected graves, over which men walk unawares.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK11_46' data-id='LK11_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>But Jesus went on, <span class='wj'>“Alas for you, too, you students of the Law! You load people with loads that are too heavy to carry, but do not, yourselves, touch them with one of your fingers.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK11_47' data-id='LK11_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Alas for you! You build the monuments of the prophets whom your ancestors killed.</span> </span>

<span class='v LK11_49' data-id='LK11_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>That is why the wisdom of God said — ‘I will send to them prophets and apostles,</span> </span>
