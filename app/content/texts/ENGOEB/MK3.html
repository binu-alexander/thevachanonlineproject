<span class='v MK3_1' data-id='MK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On another occasion Jesus went in to a synagogue, where there was a man whose hand was withered. </span>
<span class='v MK3_2' data-id='MK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they watched Jesus closely, to see if he would cure the man on the Sabbath, so that they might have a charge to bring against him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_3' data-id='MK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Stand out in the middle,”</span> Jesus said to the man with the withered hand; </span>
<span class='v MK3_4' data-id='MK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and to the people he said, <span class='wj'>“Is it allowable to do good at the Sabbath — or harm? To save a life, or destroy it?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_5' data-id='MK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As they remained silent, Jesus looked around at them in anger, grieving at the hardness of their hearts, and said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> The man stretched it out; and his hand had become sound. </span>
<span class='v MK3_6' data-id='MK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Immediately on leaving the synagogue, the Pharisees and the Herodians united in laying a plot against Jesus, to put him to death. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_7' data-id='MK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, followed by a great number of people from Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MK3_8' data-id='MK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>A great number, hearing of all that he was doing, came to him from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Edom, from beyond the Jordan, and from the country around Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MK3_9' data-id='MK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Jesus told his disciples to keep a small boat close by, so that the crowd would not crush him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_10' data-id='MK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he had cured many of them, and so people kept crowding around him, so all who were sick might touch him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_11' data-id='MK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The foul spirits, too, whenever they caught sight of him, flung themselves down before him, and screamed out, “You are the Son of God”! </span>
<span class='v MK3_12' data-id='MK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But he repeatedly warned them not to make him known. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_13' data-id='MK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus made his way up the hill, and called those whom he wished; and they went to him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_14' data-id='MK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He appointed twelve — whom he also named ‘apostles’ — so that they might be with him, and that he might send them out as his messengers, to preach, </span>
<span class='v MK3_15' data-id='MK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and with power to drive out demons. </span>
<span class='v MK3_16' data-id='MK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So he appointed the Twelve — Peter (which was the name that Jesus gave to Simon), </span>
<span class='v MK3_17' data-id='MK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John (to whom he gave the name of Boanerges, which means the Thunderers), </span>
<span class='v MK3_18' data-id='MK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, </span>
<span class='v MK3_19' data-id='MK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and Judas Iscariot, the man who betrayed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_20' data-id='MK3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jesus went into a house; and again a crowd collected, so that they were not even able to eat their food. </span>
<span class='v MK3_21' data-id='MK3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When his relatives heard of it, they went to take charge of him, for they said that he was out of his mind. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_22' data-id='MK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The teachers of the Law, who had come down from Jerusalem, said, “He has Beelzebul in him! He drives the demons out by the help of their chief.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_23' data-id='MK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So Jesus called them to him, and answered them in parables, <span class='wj'>“How can Satan drive out Satan?</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_24' data-id='MK3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot last;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_25' data-id='MK3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and when a household is divided against itself, it will not be able to last.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_26' data-id='MK3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, if Satan is in revolt against himself and is divided, he cannot last — his end has come!</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_27' data-id='MK3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“No man who has broken into a strong man's house can carry off his goods, without first tying him up; and not until then will he plunder his house.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_28' data-id='MK3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you that people will be forgiven everything — their sins, and all the slanders that they utter;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_29' data-id='MK3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but whoever slanders the Holy Spirit remains unforgiven to the end; he has to answer for an enduring sin.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_30' data-id='MK3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>This was said in reply to the charge that he had a foul spirit in him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_31' data-id='MK3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>His mother and his brothers came, and stood outside, and sent to ask him to come to them. </span>
<span class='v MK3_32' data-id='MK3_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and some of them said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_33' data-id='MK3_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Who is my mother? And my brothers?”</span> was his reply. </span>
<span class='v MK3_34' data-id='MK3_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then he looked around on the people sitting in a circle around him, and said, <span class='wj'>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</span> </span>
<span class='v MK3_35' data-id='MK3_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</span> </span></div></div>
