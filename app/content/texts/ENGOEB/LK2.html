<span class='v LK2_1' data-id='LK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>About that time an edict was issued by the Emperor Augustus that a census should be taken of the whole Empire. </span>
<span class='v LK2_2' data-id='LK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>(This was the first census taken while Quirinius was Governor of Syria). </span>
<span class='v LK2_3' data-id='LK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And everyone went to his own town to be registered. </span>
<span class='v LK2_4' data-id='LK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Among others Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem, the town of David, in Judea — because he belonged to the family and house of David — </span>
<span class='v LK2_5' data-id='LK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>To be registered with Mary, his engaged wife, who was about to become a mother. </span>
<span class='v LK2_6' data-id='LK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>While they were there her time came, </span>
<span class='v LK2_7' data-id='LK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and she gave birth to her first child, a son. And because there was no room for them in the inn, she swathed him around and laid him in a manger. </span>
<span class='v LK2_8' data-id='LK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In that same country-side were shepherds out in the open fields, watching their flocks that night, </span>
<span class='v LK2_9' data-id='LK2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>when an angel of the Lord suddenly stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were seized with fear. </span>
<span class='v LK2_10' data-id='LK2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Have no fear,” the angel said. “For I bring you good news of a great joy in store for all the nation. </span>
<span class='v LK2_11' data-id='LK2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This day there has been born to you, in the town of David, a Savior, who is Christ and Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK2_12' data-id='LK2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And this will be the sign for you. You will find the infant swathed, and lying in a manger.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_13' data-id='LK2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly Host, praising God, and singing — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“glory to God on high, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'>And on earth peace among those in whom he finds pleasure.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK2_15' data-id='LK2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now, when the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go at once to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has happened, of which the Lord has told us.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_16' data-id='LK2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So they went quickly, and found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in a manger; </span>
<span class='v LK2_17' data-id='LK2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and, when they saw it, they told of all that had been said to them about this child. </span>
<span class='v LK2_18' data-id='LK2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>All who heard the shepherds were astonished at their story, </span>
<span class='v LK2_19' data-id='LK2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>while Mary treasured up all that they said, and thought about it often in her thoughts. </span>
<span class='v LK2_20' data-id='LK2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds went back, giving glory and praise to God for all that they had heard and seen. It had all happened as they had been told. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_21' data-id='LK2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Eight days after the birth of the child, when it was time to circumcise him, he received the name Jesus — the name given him by the angel before his conception. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_22' data-id='LK2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When the period of purification of mother and child, required by the Law of Moses, came to an end, his parents took the child up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, </span>
<span class='v LK2_23' data-id='LK2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>in compliance with the Law of the Lord that every first-born male will be dedicated to the Lord, </span>
<span class='v LK2_24' data-id='LK2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and also to offer the sacrifice required by the Law of the Lord — a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_25' data-id='LK2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>There was at that time in Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a righteous and devout man, who lived in constant expectation of the Consolation of Israel, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v LK2_26' data-id='LK2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ. </span>
<span class='v LK2_27' data-id='LK2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Moved by the Spirit, Simeon came into the Temple Courts, and, when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the Law, </span>
<span class='v LK2_28' data-id='LK2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Simeon himself took the child in his arms, and blessed God, and said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Now, Lord, you will let your servant go, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'>According to your word, in peace, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_30' data-id='LK2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>for my eyes have seen the salvation </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_31' data-id='LK2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Which you have prepared in the sight of all nations — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>A light to bring light to the Gentiles, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'>And to be the glory of your people Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_33' data-id='LK2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>While the child's father and mother were wondering at what was said about him, </span>
<span class='v LK2_34' data-id='LK2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Simeon gave them his blessing, and said to Mary, the child's mother, “This child is appointed to be the cause of the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign much spoken against — </span>
<span class='v LK2_35' data-id='LK2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Yes, the sword will pierce your own heart — and so the thoughts in many minds will be disclosed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_36' data-id='LK2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>There was also a prophet named Hannah, a daughter of Phanuel and of the tribe of Asher. She was far advanced in years, having lived with her husband for seven years after marriage, </span>
<span class='v LK2_37' data-id='LK2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and then a widow, until she had reached the age of eighty-four. She never left the Temple Courts, but, fasting and praying, worshiped God night and day. </span>
<span class='v LK2_38' data-id='LK2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>At that moment she came up, and began publicly to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the deliverance of Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_39' data-id='LK2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>When the child's parents had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. </span>
<span class='v LK2_40' data-id='LK2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>The child grew and became strong and wise, and the blessing of God was on him. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_41' data-id='LK2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Every year the child's parents used to go to Jerusalem at the Passover Festival. </span>
<span class='v LK2_42' data-id='LK2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>When Jesus was twelve years old, they went according to custom to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v LK2_43' data-id='LK2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and had finished their visit; but, when they started to return, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, without their knowing it. </span>
<span class='v LK2_44' data-id='LK2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Thinking that he was with their fellow travelers, they went one day's journey before searching for him among their relatives and acquaintances; </span>
<span class='v LK2_45' data-id='LK2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>and then, as they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching everywhere for him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_46' data-id='LK2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>It was not until the third day that they found him in the Temple Courts, sitting among the teachers, now listening to them, now asking them questions. </span>
<span class='v LK2_47' data-id='LK2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>All who listened to him marveled at his intelligence and his answers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_48' data-id='LK2_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>His parents were amazed when they saw him, and his mother said to him, “My child, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_49' data-id='LK2_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What made you search for me?”</span> he answered. <span class='wj'>“Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK2_50' data-id='LK2_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>His parents did not understand what he meant. </span>
<span class='v LK2_51' data-id='LK2_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>However he went down with them to Nazareth, and submitted himself to their control; and his mother treasured all that was said in her heart. </span>
<span class='v LK2_52' data-id='LK2_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus grew in wisdom as he grew in years, and gained the blessing of God and people. </span></div></div>
