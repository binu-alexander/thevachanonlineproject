<span class='v C15_1' data-id='C15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>There is a wide-spread report respecting a case of immorality among you, and that, too, of a kind that does not occur even among the Gentiles — a man, I hear, is living with his father's wife! </span>
<span class='v C15_2' data-id='C15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Instead of grieving over it and taking steps for the expulsion of the man who has done this thing, is it possible that you are still puffed up? </span>
<span class='v C15_3' data-id='C15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I myself, though absent in body, have been present with you in spirit, and in the name of our Lord Jesus I have already passed judgment, just as if I had been present, on the man who has acted in this way. </span>
<span class='v C15_4' data-id='C15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I have decided — having been present in spirit at your meetings, when the power of the Lord Jesus was with us — </span>
<span class='v C15_5' data-id='C15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to deliver such a man as this over to Satan, that what is sensual in him may be destroyed, so that his spirit may be saved at the day of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C15_6' data-id='C15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your boasting is unseemly. Don't you know that even a little leaven leavens all the dough? </span>
<span class='v C15_7' data-id='C15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Get rid entirely of the old leaven, so that you may be like new dough — free from leaven, as in truth you are. For our passover lamb is already sacrificed — Christ himself; </span>
<span class='v C15_8' data-id='C15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>therefore let us keep our festival, not with the leaven of former days, nor with the leaven of vice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C15_9' data-id='C15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I told you, in my letter, not to associate with immoral people — </span>
<span class='v C15_10' data-id='C15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>not, of course, meaning people of the world who are in immoral, or who are covetous and grasping, or who worship idols; for then you would have to leave the world altogether. </span>
<span class='v C15_11' data-id='C15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But, as things are, I say that you are not to associate with anyone who, although a follower of Christ in name, is immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or grasping — no, not even to sit down to eat with such people. </span>
<span class='v C15_12' data-id='C15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>What have I to do with judging those outside the church? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the church, </span>
<span class='v C15_13' data-id='C15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>while God judges those who are outside? Put away the wicked from among you. </span></div></div>
