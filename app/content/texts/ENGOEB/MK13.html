<span class='v MK13_2' data-id='MK13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Do you see these great buildings?”</span> asked Jesus. <span class='wj'>“Not a single stone will be left here on another, which will not be thrown down.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MK13_8' data-id='MK13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines.
