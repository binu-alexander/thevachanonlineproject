<div class='s'>Introduction </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>From Paul, now a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, a fellow follower of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PM1_2' data-id='PM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>To our dear friend and fellow worker Philemon, to our sister Apphia, to our fellow soldier Archippus; and to the church that meets at Philemon's house; </span>
<span class='v PM1_3' data-id='PM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>may God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you and give you peace. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Request regarding runaway slave </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_4' data-id='PM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I always mention you in my prayers and thank God for you, </span>
<span class='v PM1_5' data-id='PM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because I hear of the love and the faith which you show, not only to the Lord Jesus, but also to all his people; </span>
<span class='v PM1_6' data-id='PM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and I pray that your participation in the faith may result in action, as you come to a fuller realization of everything that is good and Christlike in us. </span>
<span class='v PM1_7' data-id='PM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have indeed found great joy and encouragement in your love, knowing, as I do, how the hearts of Christ's People have been cheered, friend, by you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_8' data-id='PM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And so, though my union with Christ enables me, with all confidence, to dictate the course that you should adopt, </span>
<span class='v PM1_9' data-id='PM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>yet the claims of love make me prefer to plead with you — yes, even me, Paul, though I am an ambassador for Christ Jesus and, now a prisoner for him as well. </span>
<span class='v PM1_10' data-id='PM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I plead with you for this child of mine, Onesimus, to whom, in my prison, I have become a father. </span>
<span class='v PM1_11' data-id='PM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Once he was of little service to you, but now he has become of great service, not only to you, but to me as well; </span>
<span class='v PM1_12' data-id='PM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and I am sending him back to you with this letter — though it is like tearing out of my heart. </span>
<span class='v PM1_13' data-id='PM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For my own sake I should like to keep him with me, so that, while I am in prison for the good news, he might attend to my wants on your behalf. </span>
<span class='v PM1_14' data-id='PM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I do not wish to do anything without your consent, because I want your generosity to be voluntary and not, as it were, compulsory. </span>
<span class='v PM1_15' data-id='PM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>It may be that he was separated from you for an hour, for this reason, so that you might have him back for ever, </span>
<span class='v PM1_16' data-id='PM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but as something better — a dearly loved friend and follower of the Lord, especially dear to me, and how much more so to you, not only as a person, but as your fellow Christian! </span>
<span class='v PM1_17' data-id='PM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If, then, you count me your friend, receive him as you would me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_18' data-id='PM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If he has caused you any loss, or owes you anything, charge it to me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_19' data-id='PM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, put my own hand to it — I will repay you myself. I say nothing about your owing me your self. </span>
<span class='v PM1_20' data-id='PM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Yes, friend, let me gain something from you because of your union with the Lord. Cheer my heart by your Christlike spirit. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_21' data-id='PM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Even as I write, I have such confidence in your compliance with my wishes, that I am sure that you will do even more than I am asking. </span>
<span class='v PM1_22' data-id='PM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Please also get a lodging ready for me, for I hope that I will be given back to you all in answer to your prayers. </span></div>

<span class='v PM1_23' data-id='PM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, who is my fellow prisoner for Christ Jesus, sends you his greeting; </span>
<span class='v PM1_24' data-id='PM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers, send theirs. </span></div>
