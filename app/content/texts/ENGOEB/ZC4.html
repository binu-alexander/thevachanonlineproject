<span class='v ZC4_1' data-id='ZC4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the messenger who talked with me came again and woke me, as someone who is woken from sleep. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see a candlestick, all of gold, with a bowl on its top, and seven lamps on it. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on its top, </span>
<span class='v ZC4_3' data-id='ZC4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and two olive trees next to it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on its left side.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_4' data-id='ZC4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the messenger who talked with me answered, “Don't you know what these are?” And I said. “No, my lord.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_6' data-id='ZC4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “This is the message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> regarding Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, </span>
<span class='v ZC4_7' data-id='ZC4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>will I make the great mountain before Zerubbabel a plain. He will bring forth the top stones with shoutings of, ‘Grace, grace, to it.’ ” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_8' data-id='ZC4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Moreover this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v ZC4_9' data-id='ZC4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it. Then you will know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_10' data-id='ZC4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For who has despised the day of small things? They will rejoice, and will see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. (The seven lamps are the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that search all around the world.) </span>
<span class='v ZC4_11' data-id='ZC4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Again I asked, “What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on its left side?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_12' data-id='ZC4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Again, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are pouring out the golden oil through the two golden pipes?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_13' data-id='ZC4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He answered me, “Don't you now what these are?” And I said, “No, my lord.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_14' data-id='ZC4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he explained, “They are the two anointed ones who attend the Lord of all the earth.” </span></div></div>
