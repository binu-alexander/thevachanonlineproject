<span class='v J15_1' data-id='J15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God, and everyone who loves a parent loves his child. </span>
<span class='v J15_2' data-id='J15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By this we know that we love God's children — when we love God and carry out his commands. </span>
<span class='v J15_3' data-id='J15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For to love God is to do what he commands and his commands are not a burden, </span>
<span class='v J15_4' data-id='J15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for whatever is born of God overcomes the world. What is the victory by which the world is overcome? Our faith! </span>
<span class='v J15_5' data-id='J15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Who can overcome the world but the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? </span>
<span class='v J15_6' data-id='J15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jesus Christ, the one who came by water and blood — not by water only but by water and blood — and the Spirit testifies to this because the Spirit is truth. </span>
<span class='v J15_7' data-id='J15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Indeed three testify: </span>
<span class='v J15_8' data-id='J15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and these three agree. </span>
<span class='v J15_9' data-id='J15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>We accept human testimony, surely God's testimony is even stronger! And God's testimony is the testimony he has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_10' data-id='J15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The person who believes in the Son of God has that testimony within them. The person who does not believe God has made God a liar, by not believing the testimony God has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_11' data-id='J15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And this is that testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_12' data-id='J15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Whoever has the Son has life; whoever who doesn't have God's Son does not have life. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final words </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J15_13' data-id='J15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I have written these things to you who believe in the name of God's Son, so that you may know that you have eternal life. </span>
<span class='v J15_14' data-id='J15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>We can approach him with this confidence, that whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will, he listens to us. </span>
<span class='v J15_15' data-id='J15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And if we know he hears us — whatever we ask — we know also that what we ask for is ours. </span>
<span class='v J15_16' data-id='J15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If anyone sees one of our people committing some sin that is not a sin leading to death, they should ask, and God will give them life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not saying that you should pray about that. </span>
<span class='v J15_17' data-id='J15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J15_18' data-id='J15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>We know that those who have been born of God do not keep sinning. God protects his children and the evil one cannot get hold of them. </span>
<span class='v J15_19' data-id='J15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We know that we are God's children, though the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. </span>
<span class='v J15_20' data-id='J15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know the true God - and we are in him who is true, by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life. </span>
<span class='v J15_21' data-id='J15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>My children, guard yourselves against false ideas of God. </span></div></div>
