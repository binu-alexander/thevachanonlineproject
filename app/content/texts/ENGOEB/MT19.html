<div class='s'>The Journey to Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_1' data-id='MT19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At the conclusion of this teaching, Jesus withdrew from Galilee, and went into that district of Judea which is on the other side of the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v MT19_2' data-id='MT19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Great crowds followed him, and he cured them there. </span>
<span class='v MT19_3' data-id='MT19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Presently some Pharisees came up to him, and, to test him, said, “Has a man the right to divorce his wife for every cause?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_4' data-id='MT19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Haven't you read,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_5' data-id='MT19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and said — ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother, and be united to his wife, and the man and his wife will become one’?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_6' data-id='MT19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So that they are no longer two, but one. What God himself, then, has yoked together people must not separate.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_7' data-id='MT19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Why, then,” they said, “did Moses direct that a man should serve his wife with a notice of separation and divorce her?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_8' data-id='MT19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Moses, owing to the hardness of your hearts,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“permitted you to divorce your wives, but that was not so at the beginning.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_9' data-id='MT19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, and marries another woman, is guilty of adultery.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_10' data-id='MT19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“If that,” said the disciples, “is the position of a man with regard to his wife, it is better not to marry.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_11' data-id='MT19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“It is not everyone,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“who can accept this teaching, but only those who have been enabled to do so.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_12' data-id='MT19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Some men, it is true, have from birth been disabled for marriage, while others have been disabled by their fellow men, and others again have disabled themselves for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Accept this if you can.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_13' data-id='MT19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then some little children were brought to Jesus, for him to place his hands on them, and pray; but the disciples found fault with those who had brought them. </span>
<span class='v MT19_14' data-id='MT19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, said, <span class='wj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_15' data-id='MT19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So he placed his hands on them, and then went on his way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_16' data-id='MT19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>A man came up to Jesus, and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to obtain eternal life?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_17' data-id='MT19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why ask me about goodness?”</span> answered Jesus. <span class='wj'>“There is but One who is good. If you want to enter the life, keep the commandments.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_18' data-id='MT19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“What commandments?” asked the man. <span class='wj'>“These,”</span> answered Jesus, — <span class='wj'>“ ‘You must not kill. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not say what is false about others.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_19' data-id='MT19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Honor your father and your mother.’ And ‘You must love your neighbor as you love yourself.’ ”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_20' data-id='MT19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“I have observed all these,” said the young man. “What is still wanting in me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_21' data-id='MT19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If you wish to be perfect,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“go and sell your property, and give to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_22' data-id='MT19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>On hearing these words, the young man went away distressed, for he had great possessions. </span>
<span class='v MT19_23' data-id='MT19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>At this, Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“I tell you that a rich person will find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_24' data-id='MT19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I say again, it is easier for a camel to get through a needle's eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_25' data-id='MT19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, the disciples exclaimed in great astonishment, “Who then can possibly be saved?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_26' data-id='MT19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked at them, and said, <span class='wj'>“With people this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.”</span> Then Peter turned and said to Jesus, </span>
<span class='v MT19_27' data-id='MT19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“But we — we left everything, and followed you; what, then, will we have?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_28' data-id='MT19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I tell you,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“that at the new creation, when the Son of Man takes his seat on his throne of glory, you who followed me will be seated on twelve thrones, as judges of the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_29' data-id='MT19_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or land, for my sake, will receive many times as much, and will gain eternal life.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT19_30' data-id='MT19_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But many who are first now will then be last, and those who are last will be first.</span> </span></div></div>
