<span class='v MT16_1' data-id='MT16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Here the Pharisees and Sadducees came up, and, to test Jesus, requested him to show them some sign from the heavens. </span>
<span class='v MT16_2' data-id='MT16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“In the evening you say ‘It will be fine weather, for the sky is as red as fire.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_3' data-id='MT16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But in the morning you say ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is as red as fire and threatening.’ You learn to read the sky; yet you are unable to read the signs of the times!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_4' data-id='MT16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A wicked and unfaithful generation is asking for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</span> So he left them and went away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_5' data-id='MT16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now the disciples had crossed to the opposite shore, and had forgotten to take any bread. </span>
<span class='v MT16_6' data-id='MT16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Presently Jesus said to them, “Take care and be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_7' data-id='MT16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But the disciples began talking among themselves about their having brought no bread. </span>
<span class='v MT16_8' data-id='MT16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>On noticing this, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Why are you talking among yourselves about your being short of bread, you of little faith?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_9' data-id='MT16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Don't you yet see, nor remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took away?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_10' data-id='MT16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Nor yet the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you took away?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_11' data-id='MT16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>How is it that you do not see that I was not speaking about bread? Be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_12' data-id='MT16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they understood that he had told them to be on their guard, not against the leaven of bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_13' data-id='MT16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>On coming into the region of Caesarea Philippi, Jesus asked his disciples this question — <span class='wj'>“Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_14' data-id='MT16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Some say John the Baptist,” they answered, “Others, however, say that he is Elijah, while others again say Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_15' data-id='MT16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“But you,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“who do you say that I am?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_16' data-id='MT16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To this Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_17' data-id='MT16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah,”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“For no human being has revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_18' data-id='MT16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yes, and I say to you, your name is ‘Peter’ — a Rock, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail over it.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_19' data-id='MT16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you forbid on earth will be held in heaven to be forbidden, and whatever you allow on earth will be held in heaven to be allowed.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_20' data-id='MT16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he charged his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_21' data-id='MT16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus Christ began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and undergo much suffering at the hands of the elders, and chief priests, and teachers of the Law, and be put to death, and rise on the third day. </span>
<span class='v MT16_22' data-id='MT16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Peter took Jesus aside, and began to rebuke him. “Master,” he said, “please God that will never be your fate!” </span>
<span class='v MT16_23' data-id='MT16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, turning to Peter, said, <span class='wj'>“Out of my way, Satan! You are a hindrance to me; for you look at things, not as God does, but as person does.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_24' data-id='MT16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“If anyone wishes to walk in my steps, they must renounce self, and take up their cross, and follow me.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_25' data-id='MT16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, and whoever, for my sake, loses his life will find it.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_26' data-id='MT16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>What good will it do a person to gain the whole world, if he forfeits his life? Or what will a person give that is of equal value with his life?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_27' data-id='MT16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For the Son of Man is to come in his Father's glory, with his angels, and then he will give to everyone what his actions deserve.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT16_28' data-id='MT16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, some of those who are standing here will not know death until they have seen the Son of Man coming into his kingdom.”</span> </span></div></div>
