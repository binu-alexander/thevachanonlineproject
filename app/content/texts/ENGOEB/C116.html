<div class='s'>Conclusion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_1' data-id='C116_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>With reference to the collection for Christ's people, I want you to follow the instructions that I gave to the churches in Galatia. </span>
<span class='v C116_2' data-id='C116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of every week each of you should put by what he can afford, so that no collections need be made after I have come. </span>
<span class='v C116_3' data-id='C116_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On my arrival, I will send any persons, whom you may authorize by letter, to carry your gift to Jerusalem; </span>
<span class='v C116_4' data-id='C116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and, if it appears to be worth while for me to go also, they will go with me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_5' data-id='C116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will come to you as soon as I have been through Macedonia — for I am going through Macedonia — </span>
<span class='v C116_6' data-id='C116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will probably make some stay with you or, perhaps, remain for the winter, so that you may yourselves send me on my way, wherever I may be going. </span>
<span class='v C116_7' data-id='C116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I do not propose to pay you a visit in passing now, for I hope to stay with you for some time, if the Lord permits. </span>
<span class='v C116_8' data-id='C116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I intend, however, staying at Ephesus until the Festival at the close of the Harvest; </span>
<span class='v C116_9' data-id='C116_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>for a great opening for active work has presented itself, and there are many opponents. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_10' data-id='C116_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If Timothy comes, take care that he has no cause for feeling anxious while he is with you. He is doing the Master's work no less than I am. </span>
<span class='v C116_11' data-id='C116_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No one, therefore, should slight him. See him safely on his way to me, for I am expecting him with some of our friends. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_12' data-id='C116_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for our friend Apollos, I have often urged him to go to you with the others. He has, however, been very unwilling to do so as yet; but he will go as soon as he finds a good opportunity. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_13' data-id='C116_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be watchful; stand firm in your faith; be brave; be strong. </span>
<span class='v C116_14' data-id='C116_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let everything you do be done in a loving spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_15' data-id='C116_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I have another request to make of you, friends. You remember Stephanas and his household, and that they were the first-fruits gathered in from Greece, and set themselves to serve Christ's people. </span>
<span class='v C116_16' data-id='C116_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I want you, on your part, to show deference to such people as these, as well as to every fellow laborer and earnest worker. </span>
<span class='v C116_17' data-id='C116_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I am glad Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come, for they have made up for your absence; </span>
<span class='v C116_18' data-id='C116_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>they have cheered my heart, and your hearts also. Recognize the worth of such people as these. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_19' data-id='C116_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The churches in Roman Asia send you their greetings. Aquila and Prisca and the church that meets at their house send you many Christian greetings. </span>
<span class='v C116_20' data-id='C116_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>All of the Lord's followers send you greetings. Greet one another with a sacred kiss. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_21' data-id='C116_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. </span>
<span class='v C116_22' data-id='C116_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Accursed be anyone who has no love for the Lord. THE LORD IS COMING. </span>
<span class='v C116_23' data-id='C116_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of the Lord Jesus be with you. </span>
<span class='v C116_24' data-id='C116_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>My love to all of you who are in union with Christ Jesus. </span></div></div>
