<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_1' data-id='PP1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>To all Christ's people at Philippi, with the supervisors and assistants, from Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PP1_2' data-id='PP1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ bless you, and give you peace. </span>
<span class='v PP1_3' data-id='PP1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Every recollection that I have of you is a cause of thankfulness to God, </span>
<span class='v PP1_4' data-id='PP1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>always, in every prayer that I offer for you all — my prayers are full of joy — </span>
<span class='v PP1_5' data-id='PP1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Because of the share that you have had in spreading the good news, from the first day that you received it until now. </span>
<span class='v PP1_6' data-id='PP1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For of this I am confident, that he who began a good work in you will complete it in readiness for the day of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP1_7' data-id='PP1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And, indeed, I am justified in feeling like this about you all; because you have a warm place in my heart — you who all, both in my imprisonment and in the work of defending and establishing the good news, shared my privilege with me. </span>
<span class='v PP1_8' data-id='PP1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>God will bear me witness how I yearn over you all with the tenderness of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PP1_9' data-id='PP1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And what I pray for is this — that your love may grow yet stronger and stronger, with increasing knowledge and all discernment, </span>
<span class='v PP1_10' data-id='PP1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>until you are able to appreciate all moral distinctions. And I pray, too, that you may be kept pure and blameless against the day of Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP1_11' data-id='PP1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>bearing a rich harvest of that righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_12' data-id='PP1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Friends, I want you to realize that what has happened to me has actually served to forward the good news. </span>
<span class='v PP1_13' data-id='PP1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>It has even become evident, not only to all the imperial guard, but to everyone else, that it is for Christ's sake that I am in chains. </span>
<span class='v PP1_14' data-id='PP1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And besides this, most of our fellow followers have gained confidence in the Lord through my chains, and now venture with far greater freedom to speak of God's message fearlessly. </span>
<span class='v PP1_15' data-id='PP1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>It is true that some do proclaim the Christ out of Jealousy and opposition; but there are others who proclaim him from goodwill. </span>
<span class='v PP1_16' data-id='PP1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The latter do it from love for me, knowing that I have been appointed to plead the cause of the good news. </span>
<span class='v PP1_17' data-id='PP1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The former spread the news of the Christ in a factious spirit, and not sincerely, thinking to add to the pain of my chains. </span>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But what of that? Only that in some way or other, either with assumed or with real earnestness, Christ is being made known; and at that I rejoice. </span>
<span class='v PP1_19' data-id='PP1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Yes, and I will rejoice, for I know that, through your prayers and through a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, all this will make for my salvation. </span>
<span class='v PP1_20' data-id='PP1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And this will fulfill my earnest expectation and hope that I will have no cause for shame, but that, with unfailing courage, now as hitherto, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by my life or by my death, </span>
<span class='v PP1_21' data-id='PP1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>for to me life is Christ, and death is gain. </span>
<span class='v PP1_22' data-id='PP1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But what if the life here in the body — if this brings me fruit from my labors? Then which to choose I cannot tell! I am sorely perplexed either way! </span>
<span class='v PP1_23' data-id='PP1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>My own desire is to depart and be with Christ, for this would be far better. </span>
<span class='v PP1_24' data-id='PP1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But, for your sakes, it may be more needful that I should still remain here in the body. </span>
<span class='v PP1_25' data-id='PP1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Yes, I am confident that this is so, and therefore I am sure that I will stay, and stay near you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith; </span>
<span class='v PP1_26' data-id='PP1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>so that, when you once more have me among you, you, in your union with Christ Jesus, may find in me fresh cause for exultation. </span>
<span class='v PP1_27' data-id='PP1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Under all circumstances let your lives be worthy of the good news of the Christ: so that, whether I come and see you, or whether I hear of your affairs at a distance, I may know that you are standing firm, animated by one spirit, and joining with one heart in a common struggle for the faith taught by the good news, </span>
<span class='v PP1_28' data-id='PP1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>without ever shrinking from your opponents. To them this will be a sign of their destruction and of your salvation — a sign from God. </span>
<span class='v PP1_29' data-id='PP1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For, on behalf of Christ, you have had the privilege granted you, not only of trusting in him, but also of suffering on his behalf. </span>
<span class='v PP1_30' data-id='PP1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>You will be engaged in the same hard struggle as that which you once saw me waging, and which you hear that I am waging still. </span></div></div>
