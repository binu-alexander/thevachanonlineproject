<span class='v MK16_8' data-id='MK16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They went out, and fled from the tomb, for they were trembling and bewildered; and they did not say a word to anyone, for they were frightened. </span></div>

<span class='v MK16_11' data-id='MK16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>yet even they, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, did not believe it. </span>
<span class='v MK16_12' data-id='MK16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Afterward, altered in appearance, he made himself known to two of them, as they were walking, on their way into the country. </span>

<span class='v MK16_14' data-id='MK16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Later on, he made himself known to the Eleven themselves as they were at a meal, and reproached them with their want of faith and their stubbornness, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead. </span>
<span class='v MK16_15' data-id='MK16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news to all creation.</span> </span>
