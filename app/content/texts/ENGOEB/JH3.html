<div class='s'>The message to Nineveh </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_1' data-id='JH3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This message from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jonah the second time, </span>
<span class='v JH3_2' data-id='JH3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” </span>
<span class='v JH3_3' data-id='JH3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Jonah started for Nineveh, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded. Now Nineveh was so large a city that it took three days' journey to cross it. </span>
<span class='v JH3_4' data-id='JH3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jonah began by going a day's journey into the city, and he proclaimed, “Forty days more and Nineveh shall be overthrown.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_5' data-id='JH3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they ordered a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. </span>
<span class='v JH3_6' data-id='JH3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when word came to the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his robe, dressed in sackcloth, and sat in ashes. </span>
<span class='v JH3_7' data-id='JH3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he made this proclamation and published it in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: People, beast, herd, and flock shall not taste anything; let them not eat nor drink water. </span>
<span class='v JH3_8' data-id='JH3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let both people and animals put on sackcloth and let them cry earnestly to God; let them each turn from their evil ways and from the deeds of violence which they are doing. </span>
<span class='v JH3_9' data-id='JH3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Who knows? God may relent and avert his fierce anger, so that we may not die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_10' data-id='JH3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When God saw that they turned from their evil course, he relented the evil which he said he would do to them, and did not do it. </span></div></div>
