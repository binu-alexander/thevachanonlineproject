<span class='v MT8_1' data-id='MT8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had come down from the hill, great crowds followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_2' data-id='MT8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He saw a leper who came up, and bowed to the ground before him, and said, “Master, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_3' data-id='MT8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Stretching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying as he did so, <span class='wj'>“I am willing; become clean.”</span> Instantly he was made clean from his leprosy; </span>
<span class='v MT8_4' data-id='MT8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Be careful not to say a word to anyone, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift directed by Moses, as evidence of your cure.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_5' data-id='MT8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had entered Capernaum, a captain in the Roman army came up to him, entreating his help. </span>
<span class='v MT8_6' data-id='MT8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” he said, “my manservant is lying ill at my house with a stroke of paralysis, and is suffering terribly.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_7' data-id='MT8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I will come and cure him,”</span> answered Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT8_8' data-id='MT8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” the captain went on, “I am unworthy to receive you under my roof; but only speak, and my manservant will be cured. </span>
<span class='v MT8_9' data-id='MT8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under the orders of others, with soldiers under me; and, if I say to one of them ‘Go,’ he goes, and to another ‘Come,’ he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this,’ he does it.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_10' data-id='MT8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus was surprised to hear this, and said to those who were following him, <span class='wj'>“Never I tell you, in any Israelite have I met with such faith as this!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_11' data-id='MT8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yes, and many will come in from East and West and take their places beside Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_12' data-id='MT8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>while the heirs to the kingdom will be banished into the darkness outside; there, there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_13' data-id='MT8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to the captain, <span class='wj'>“Go now, and it will be according to your faith.”</span> And the man was cured that very hour. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_14' data-id='MT8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law prostrated with fever. </span>
<span class='v MT8_15' data-id='MT8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>On his taking her hand, the fever left her, and she rose and began to take care of him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_16' data-id='MT8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the evening the people brought to Jesus many who were possessed by demons; and he drove out the spirits with a word, and cured all who were ill, </span>
<span class='v MT8_17' data-id='MT8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>in fulfillment of these words in the prophet Isaiah — ‘He took our infirmities on himself, and bore the burden of our diseases.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_18' data-id='MT8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Seeing a crowd around him, Jesus gave orders to go across. </span>
<span class='v MT8_19' data-id='MT8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>A teacher of the Law came up to him, and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_20' data-id='MT8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Foxes have holes,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and wild birds their nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_21' data-id='MT8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said another, who was a disciple, “let me first go and bury my father.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_22' data-id='MT8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT8_23' data-id='MT8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he got into the boat, followed by his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT8_24' data-id='MT8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Suddenly so great a storm came up on the sea, that the waves broke right over the boat. But Jesus was asleep; </span>
<span class='v MT8_25' data-id='MT8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and the disciples came and roused him. “Master,” they cried, “save us; we are lost!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_26' data-id='MT8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why are you so timid?”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“You of little faith!”</span> Then Jesus rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm followed. </span>
<span class='v MT8_27' data-id='MT8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The men were amazed, and exclaimed, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_28' data-id='MT8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>On getting to the other side — the region of the Gadarenes — Jesus met two men who were possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one was able to pass that way. </span>
<span class='v MT8_29' data-id='MT8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Suddenly they shrieked out, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before our time?” </span>
<span class='v MT8_30' data-id='MT8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>A long way off, there was a drove of many pigs, feeding; </span>
<span class='v MT8_31' data-id='MT8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and the foul spirits began begging Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the drove of pigs.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_32' data-id='MT8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Go,”</span> he said. The spirits came out, and entered the pigs; and the whole drove rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and died in the water. </span>
<span class='v MT8_33' data-id='MT8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>At this the men who tended them ran away and went to the town, carrying the news of all that had occurred, and of what had happened to the possessed men. </span>
<span class='v MT8_34' data-id='MT8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>At the news the whole town went out to meet Jesus, and, when they saw him, they entreated him to go away from their region. </span></div></div>
