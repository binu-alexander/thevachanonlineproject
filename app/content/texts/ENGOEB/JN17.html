<span class='v JN17_1' data-id='JN17_1'><span class='wj'>“Father, the hour has come; honor your Son, so that your Son may honor you;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_2' data-id='JN17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>even as you gave him power over all humanity, so that he should give eternal life to all those whom you has given him.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_3' data-id='JN17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And the eternal life is this — to know you the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom you has sent as your messenger.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_4' data-id='JN17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have honored you on earth by completing the work which you has given me to do;</span> </span>

<span class='v JN17_6' data-id='JN17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have revealed you to those whom you gave me from the world; they were your own, and you gave them to me; and they have laid your message to heart.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_7' data-id='JN17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They recognize now that everything that you gave me was from you;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_8' data-id='JN17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for I have given them the teaching which you gave me, and they received it, and clearly understood that I came from you, and they believed that you has sent me as your messenger.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_9' data-id='JN17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I intercede for them; I am not interceding for the world, but for those whom you has given me, for they are your own —</span> </span>

<span class='v JN17_20' data-id='JN17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But it is not only for them that I am interceding, but also for those who believe in me through their message,</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_21' data-id='JN17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>that they all may be one — that as you, Father, are in union with us — and so the world may believe that you have sent me as your messenger.</span> </span>

<span class='v JN17_23' data-id='JN17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I in union with them and you with me — that so they may be perfected in their union, and so that the world may know that you have sent me as your messenger, and that you have loved them as you have loved me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_24' data-id='JN17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Father, my desire for all those whom you have given me is that they may be with me where I am, so that they may see the honor which you have given me; for thou did love me before the beginning of the world.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_25' data-id='JN17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Righteous Father, though the world did not know you, I knew you; and these people knew that you have sent me as your messenger.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN17_26' data-id='JN17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have made you known to them, and will do so still; that the love that you have had for me may be in their hearts, and that I may be in them also.”</span> </span></div></div>
