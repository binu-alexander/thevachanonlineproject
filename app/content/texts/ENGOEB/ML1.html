<span class='v ML1_3' data-id='ML1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but hated Esau, and made his mountains a desolation, and transformed his ancestral land into a wilderness. </span>

<span class='v ML1_7' data-id='ML1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You offer on my altar bread that is polluted. You ask, ‘How have we polluted it?’ Because you say, ‘The table of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is contemptible.’ </span>
