<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_1' data-id='HB12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Seeing, therefore, that there is on every side of us such a throng of witnesses, let us also lay aside everything that hinders us, and the sin that clings about us, and run with patient endurance the race that lies before us, </span>
<span class='v HB12_2' data-id='HB12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>our eyes fixed on Jesus, the leader and perfect example of our faith, who, for the joy that lay before him, endured the cross, heedless of its shame, and now ‘has taken his seat at the right hand’ of the throne of God. </span>
<span class='v HB12_3' data-id='HB12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Weigh well the example of him who had to endure such opposition from ‘people who were sinning against themselves,’ so that you should not grow weary or faint-hearted. </span>
<span class='v HB12_4' data-id='HB12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You have not yet, in your struggle with sin, resisted to the death; </span>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and you have forgotten the encouraging words which are addressed to you as God's children — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'>‘My child, think not lightly of the Lord's discipline, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'>Do not despond when he rebukes you; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB12_6' data-id='HB12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For it is him whom he loves that he disciplines, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB12_6' data-id='HB12_6'>And he chastises every child whom he acknowledges.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB12_7' data-id='HB12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It is for your discipline that you have to endure all this. God is dealing with you as his children. For where is there a child whom his father does not discipline? </span>
<span class='v HB12_8' data-id='HB12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you are left without that discipline, in which all children share, it shows that you are bastards, and not true children. </span>
<span class='v HB12_9' data-id='HB12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Further, when our earthly fathers disciplined us, we respected them. Should we not, then, much rather yield submission to the Father of souls, and live? </span>
<span class='v HB12_10' data-id='HB12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Our fathers disciplined us for only a short time and as seemed best to them; but God disciplines us for our true good, to enable us to share his holiness. </span>
<span class='v HB12_11' data-id='HB12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No discipline is pleasant at the time; on the contrary, it is painful. But afterward its fruit is seen in the peacefulness of a righteous life which is the lot of those who have been trained under it. </span>
<span class='v HB12_12' data-id='HB12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore ‘lift again the down-dropped hands and straighten the weakened knees; </span>
<span class='v HB12_13' data-id='HB12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>make straight paths for your feet,’ so that the lame limb may not be put out of joint, but rather be cured. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Conclusion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_14' data-id='HB12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Try earnestly to live at peace with everyone, and to attain to that purity without which no one will see the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HB12_15' data-id='HB12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Take care that no one fails to use the loving help of God, ‘that no bitterness is allowed to take root and spring up, and cause trouble,’ and so poison the whole community. </span>
<span class='v HB12_16' data-id='HB12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Take care that no one becomes immoral, or irreligious like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. </span>
<span class='v HB12_17' data-id='HB12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For you know that even afterward, when he wished to claim his father's blessing, he was rejected — for he never found an opportunity to repair his error — though he begged for the blessing with tears. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_18' data-id='HB12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is not to tangible ‘flaming fire’ that you have drawn near, nor to ‘gloom, and darkness, and storm, </span>
<span class='v HB12_19' data-id='HB12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and the blast of a trumpet, and an audible voice.’ Those who heard that voice entreated that they might hear no more, </span>
<span class='v HB12_20' data-id='HB12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>for they could not bear to think of the command — ‘If even an animal touches the mountain, it is to be stoned to death;’ </span>
<span class='v HB12_21' data-id='HB12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and so fearful was the sight that Moses said — ‘I tremble with fear.’ </span>
<span class='v HB12_22' data-id='HB12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>No, but it is to Mount Zion that you have drawn near, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to countless hosts of angels, </span>
<span class='v HB12_23' data-id='HB12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>to the festal gathering and assemblage of God's firstborn whose names are enrolled in heaven, to God the judge of all people, to the spirits of the righteous who have attained perfection, </span>
<span class='v HB12_24' data-id='HB12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>to Jesus, the intermediary of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that tells of better things than the blood of Abel. </span>
<span class='v HB12_25' data-id='HB12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Beware how you refuse to hear him who is speaking. For, if the Israelites did not escape punishment, when they refused to listen to him who taught them on earth the divine will, far worse will it be for us, if we turn away from him who is teaching us from heaven. </span>
<span class='v HB12_26' data-id='HB12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then his voice shook the earth, but now his declaration is — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB12_26' data-id='HB12_26'>‘Still once more I will cause not only the earth to tremble, but also the heavens.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB12_27' data-id='HB12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And those words ‘still once more’ indicate the passing away of all that is shaken — that is, of all created things — in order that only what is unshaken may remain. </span>
<span class='v HB12_28' data-id='HB12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore, let us, who have received a kingdom that cannot be shaken, be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to God, with awe and the deepest respect. </span>
<span class='v HB12_29' data-id='HB12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For our God is ‘a consuming fire.’ </span></div></div>
