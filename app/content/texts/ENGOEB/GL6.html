<span class='v GL6_1' data-id='GL6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My friends, even if someone should be caught committing a sin, you who are spiritually minded should, in a gentle spirit, help them to recover themselves, taking care that you yourselves are not tempted. </span>
<span class='v GL6_2' data-id='GL6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Bear one another's burdens, and so carry out the Law of the Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL6_3' data-id='GL6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If a person imagines themselves to be somebody, when they are really nobody, they deceive themselves. </span>
<span class='v GL6_4' data-id='GL6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let everyone test their own work, and then their cause for satisfaction will be in themselves and not in a comparison with their neighbor; </span>
<span class='v GL6_5' data-id='GL6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for everyone must bear their own load. </span>
<span class='v GL6_6' data-id='GL6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The person, however, who is being instructed in the message ought always to share their blessings with their teacher. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_7' data-id='GL6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. What a person sows that they will reap. </span>
<span class='v GL6_8' data-id='GL6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the person who sows the field of their earthly nature will from that earthly nature reap corruption; while the one who sows the field of the spirit will from that spirit reap eternal life. </span>
<span class='v GL6_9' data-id='GL6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let us never tire of doing right, for at the proper season we will reap our harvest, if we do not grow weary. </span>
<span class='v GL6_10' data-id='GL6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore, I say, as the opportunity occurs, let us treat everyone with kindness, and especially members of the Household of the faith. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Conclusion in the Apostle's own handwriting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_11' data-id='GL6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>See in what large letters I am writing with my own hand. </span>
<span class='v GL6_12' data-id='GL6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Those who wish to appear to advantage in regard to outward observances are the people who are trying to compel you to be circumcised; and they do it only to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Jesus, the Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL6_13' data-id='GL6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Even these men who are circumcised do not themselves keep the Law; yet they want you to be circumcised, so that they may boast of your observance of the rite. </span>
<span class='v GL6_14' data-id='GL6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But, for my part, may I never boast of anything except the cross of Jesus Christ, our Master, through whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span>
<span class='v GL6_15' data-id='GL6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For neither is circumcision nor the omission of it anything; but a new nature is everything. </span>
<span class='v GL6_16' data-id='GL6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>May all who rule their conduct by this principle find peace and mercy — they who are the Israel of God. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_17' data-id='GL6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the future let no one trouble me; for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_18' data-id='GL6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of Jesus Christ, our Lord, rest on your souls, friends. Amen. </span></div></div>
