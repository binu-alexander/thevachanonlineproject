<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>for the inaccessible forest has fallen. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>Blasted is the thick forest of the Jordan. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_4' data-id='ZC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me: shepherd the flock destined for slaughter, </span>
<span class='v ZC11_5' data-id='ZC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>whose possessors slaughter them, and hold themselves not guilty! The people who sell them say, Blessed be the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for I am rich! And their own shepherds have no compassion for them. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_6' data-id='ZC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will no longer have pity on the people of this earth, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. I will turn neighbor against neighbor, and put everyone under the power of a king, and when the land is devastated I will not rescue them. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_7' data-id='ZC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I shepherded the flock of slaughter for the sheep-merchants. I took two staffs: one I called Mercy and the other I called Union. So I shepherded the sheep. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_8' data-id='ZC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I set aside three of the shepherds in one month; for I was indignant against them, and they also were displeased at me. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_9' data-id='ZC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I said, I will not shepherd you. What is dead, let it die. What is set aside, let it be set aside. And let those who are left devour one another's flesh. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_10' data-id='ZC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I took my staff, Mercy, and broke it, so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_11' data-id='ZC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In that day it was broken, and the sheep-merchants who watched me knew that it was the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>'s message. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_12' data-id='ZC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I said to them, “If it is good in your sight, give me my wage. If not, don't.” So they weighed out my wage, thirty pieces of silver. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_13' data-id='ZC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, Cast it into the treasury — the precious wage that at which I was valued by them! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, into the treasury. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_14' data-id='ZC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then I broke my second staff called Union so as to dissolve the brotherhood between Judah and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_15' data-id='ZC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me: Take again the implements of a worthless shepherd. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_16' data-id='ZC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For I am about to appoint a shepherd over the land. Those who are thrust down he will not visit. Those who are scattered he will not seek out. The wounded he will not heal, the sick he will not make whole, but the flesh of the fat he will devour and even their hoofs he will tear. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>May the sword strike his arm and his right eye. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>May his arm completely wither. </span></div>
