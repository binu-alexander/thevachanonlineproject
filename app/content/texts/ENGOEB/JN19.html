<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_1' data-id='JN19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After that, Pilate had Jesus scourged. </span>
<span class='v JN19_2' data-id='JN19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The soldiers made a crown with some thorns and put it on his head and threw a purple robe around him. </span>
<span class='v JN19_3' data-id='JN19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They kept coming up to him and saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!” and they gave him blow after blow with their hands. </span>
<span class='v JN19_4' data-id='JN19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Pilate again came outside, and said to the people, “Look! I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find nothing with which he can be charged.” </span>
<span class='v JN19_5' data-id='JN19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came outside, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe; and Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” </span>
<span class='v JN19_6' data-id='JN19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the chief priests and the police officers saw him, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_6' data-id='JN19_6'>“Take him yourselves and crucify him,” said Pilate. “For my part, I find nothing with which he can be charged.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_7' data-id='JN19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“But we,” replied the crowd, “have a Law, under which he deserves death for making himself out to be the Son of God.” </span>
<span class='v JN19_8' data-id='JN19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard what they said, he became still more alarmed; </span>
<span class='v JN19_9' data-id='JN19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and, going into the Government house again, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?” </span>
<span class='v JN19_10' data-id='JN19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no reply. So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don't you know that I have power to release you, and have power to crucify you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_11' data-id='JN19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“You would have no power over me at all,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“if it had not been given you from above; and, therefore, the man who betrayed me to you is guilty of the greater sin.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN19_12' data-id='JN19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>This made Pilate anxious to release him; but the crowd shouted, “If you release that man, you are no friend of the Emperor! Anyone who makes himself out to be a king is setting himself against the Emperor!” </span>
<span class='v JN19_13' data-id='JN19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out, and took his seat on the Bench at a place called ‘The Stone Pavement’ — in Hebrew ‘Gabbatha.’ </span>
<span class='v JN19_14' data-id='JN19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>It was the Passover Preparation day, and about noon. Then he said to the crowd, “Here is your king!” </span>
<span class='v JN19_15' data-id='JN19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>At that the people shouted, “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_15' data-id='JN19_15'>“What! Should I crucify your king?” exclaimed Pilate. “We have no king but the Emperor,” replied the chief priests; </span>
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>so Pilate gave Jesus up to them to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'>So they took Jesus; </span>
<span class='v JN19_17' data-id='JN19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and he went out, carrying his cross himself, to the place which is named from a scull, or, in Hebrew, Golgotha. </span>
<span class='v JN19_18' data-id='JN19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There they crucified him, and two others with him — one on each side, and Jesus between them. </span>
<span class='v JN19_19' data-id='JN19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Pilate also had these words written and put up over the cross — ‘JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ </span>
<span class='v JN19_20' data-id='JN19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>These words were read by many people, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and they were written in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. </span>
<span class='v JN19_21' data-id='JN19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The chief priests said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The king of the Jews’, but write what the man said — ‘I am the king of the Jews.’ ” </span>
<span class='v JN19_22' data-id='JN19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_23' data-id='JN19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares — a share for each soldier — and they took the coat also. The coat had no seam, being woven in one piece from top to bottom. </span>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So they said to one another, “Do not let us tear it, but let us cast lots for it, to see who will have it.” This was in fulfillment of the words of scripture — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>‘They shared my clothes among them, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>And over my clothing they cast lots.’ </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>That was what the soldiers did. </span>
<span class='v JN19_25' data-id='JN19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile near the cross of Jesus were standing his mother and his mother's sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary of Magdala. </span>
<span class='v JN19_26' data-id='JN19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing near, he said to his mother, <span class='wj'>“There is your son.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN19_27' data-id='JN19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to that disciple, <span class='wj'>“There is your mother.”</span> And from that very hour the disciple took her to live in his house. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_28' data-id='JN19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Afterward, knowing that everything was now finished, Jesus said, in fulfillment of the words of scripture, <span class='wj'>“I am thirsty.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN19_29' data-id='JN19_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>There was a bowl standing there full of common wine; so they put a sponge soaked in the wine on the end of a hyssop-stalk, and held it up to his mouth. </span>
<span class='v JN19_30' data-id='JN19_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had received the wine, he exclaimed, <span class='wj'>“All is finished!”</span> Then, bowing his head, he resigned his spirit to God. </span>
<span class='v JN19_31' data-id='JN19_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>It was the Preparation day, and so, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a great day), the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed. </span>
<span class='v JN19_32' data-id='JN19_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and then those of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; </span>
<span class='v JN19_33' data-id='JN19_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>but, on coming to him, when they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. </span>
<span class='v JN19_34' data-id='JN19_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately flowed from it. </span>
<span class='v JN19_35' data-id='JN19_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>This is the statement of one who actually saw it — and his statement may be relied on, and he knows that he is speaking the truth — and it is given in order that you also may be convinced. </span>
<span class='v JN19_36' data-id='JN19_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>For all this happened in fulfillment of the words of scripture — ‘Not one of its bones will be broken.’ </span>
<span class='v JN19_37' data-id='JN19_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And there is another passage which says — ‘They will look on him whom they pierced.’ </span>
<span class='v JN19_38' data-id='JN19_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>After this, Joseph of Ramah, a disciple of Jesus — but a secret one, owing to his fear of the religious authorities — begged Pilate's permission to remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him leave; so Joseph went and removed the body. </span>
<span class='v JN19_39' data-id='JN19_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, too — the man who had formerly visited Jesus by night — came with a roll of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds. </span>
<span class='v JN19_40' data-id='JN19_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>They took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial. </span>
<span class='v JN19_41' data-id='JN19_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>At the place where Jesus had been crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a newly made tomb in which no one had ever been laid. </span>
<span class='v JN19_42' data-id='JN19_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And so, because of its being the Preparation day, and as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. </span></div></div>
