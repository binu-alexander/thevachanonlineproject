<span class='v LK18_1' data-id='LK18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and never despair. </span>
<span class='v LK18_2' data-id='LK18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“There was,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“in a certain town a judge, who had no fear of God nor regard for people.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_3' data-id='LK18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In the same town there was a widow who went to him again and again, and said ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_4' data-id='LK18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For a time the judge refused, but afterward he said to himself ‘Although I am without fear of God or regard for people,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_5' data-id='LK18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>yet, as this widow is so troublesome, I will grant her justice, to stop her from plaguing me with her endless visits.’ ”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_6' data-id='LK18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the Master added, <span class='wj'>“Listen to what this iniquitous judge says!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_7' data-id='LK18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And God — won't he see that his own people, who cry to him night and day, have justice done them — though he holds his hand?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_8' data-id='LK18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He will, I tell you, give them justice soon enough! Yet, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_9' data-id='LK18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Another time, speaking to people who were satisfied that they were religious, and who regarded everyone else with scorn, Jesus told this parable — </span>
<span class='v LK18_10' data-id='LK18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Two men went up into the Temple Courts to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax-gatherer.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_11' data-id='LK18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The Pharisee stood forward and began praying to himself in this way — ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men — thieves, rogues, adulterers — or even like this tax-gatherer.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_12' data-id='LK18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I fast twice a week, and give a tenth of everything I get to God.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_13' data-id='LK18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Meanwhile the tax-gatherer stood at a distance, not venturing even to raise his eyes to heaven, but he kept striking his breast and saying ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_14' data-id='LK18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This man, I tell you, went home pardoned, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, while everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_15' data-id='LK18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Some of the people were bringing even their babies to Jesus, for him to touch them; but, when the disciples saw it, they began to find fault with those who had brought them. </span>
<span class='v LK18_16' data-id='LK18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, called the little children to him. <span class='wj'>“Let the little children come to me,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and do not hinder them, for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of God belongs.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_17' data-id='LK18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you, unless a man receives the kingdom of God like a child, he will not enter it at all.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_18' data-id='LK18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And one of the leaders asked Jesus this question — “Good teacher, what must I do if I am to gain eternal life?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_19' data-id='LK18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why do you call me good?”</span> answered Jesus. <span class='wj'>“No one is good but God.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_20' data-id='LK18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You know the commandments — Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not say what is false about others, Honor your father and your mother.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_21' data-id='LK18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“I have observed all these,” he replied, “from childhood.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_22' data-id='LK18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“There is one thing still lacking in you; sell everything that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have wealth in heaven; then come and follow me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_23' data-id='LK18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the man became greatly distressed on hearing this, for he was extremely rich. </span>
<span class='v LK18_24' data-id='LK18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Seeing this, Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_25' data-id='LK18_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It is easier, indeed, for a camel to get through a needle's eye than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God!”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_26' data-id='LK18_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>“Then who can be saved?” asked those who heard this. </span>
<span class='v LK18_27' data-id='LK18_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“What is impossible with people is possible with God.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_28' data-id='LK18_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“But we,” said Peter, “we left what belonged to us and followed you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_29' data-id='LK18_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I tell you,”</span> he answered, <span class='wj'>“that there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_30' data-id='LK18_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>who will not receive many times as much in the present, and in the age that is coming eternal life.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_31' data-id='LK18_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Gathering the Twelve around him, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Listen! We are going up to Jerusalem; and there everything that is written in the prophets will be done to the Son of Man.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_32' data-id='LK18_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For he will be given up to the Gentiles, mocked, insulted and spat on;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_33' data-id='LK18_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>they will scourge him, and then put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_34' data-id='LK18_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The apostles did not comprehend any of this. His meaning was unintelligible to them and they did not understand what he was saying. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_35' data-id='LK18_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting near Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside, begging. </span>
<span class='v LK18_36' data-id='LK18_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Hearing a crowd going by, the man asked what was the matter; </span>
<span class='v LK18_37' data-id='LK18_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and, when people told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing, </span>
<span class='v LK18_38' data-id='LK18_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>he shouted out, “Jesus, Son of David, take pity on me!” </span>
<span class='v LK18_39' data-id='LK18_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Those who were in front kept telling him to be quiet, but he continued to call out the louder, “Son of David, take pity on me!” </span>
<span class='v LK18_40' data-id='LK18_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. And, when he had come close up to him, Jesus asked him, </span>
<span class='v LK18_41' data-id='LK18_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_41' data-id='LK18_41'>“Master,” he said, “I want to recover my sight.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_42' data-id='LK18_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Recover your sight, your faith has delivered you.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK18_43' data-id='LK18_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Instantly he recovered his sight, and began to follow Jesus, praising God. And all the people, on seeing it, gave glory to God. </span></div></div>
