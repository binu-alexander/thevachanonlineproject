<span class='v T23_1' data-id='T23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Be sure of this, that in the last days difficult times will come. </span>
<span class='v T23_2' data-id='T23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>People will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, and blasphemous; disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, impure, </span>
<span class='v T23_3' data-id='T23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>incapable of affection, merciless, slanderous, wanting in self-control, brutal, careless of the right, </span>
<span class='v T23_4' data-id='T23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>treacherous, reckless, and puffed up with pride; they will love pleasure more than they love God; </span>
<span class='v T23_5' data-id='T23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and while they retain the outward form of religion, they will not allow it to influence them. Turn your back on such people as these. </span>
<span class='v T23_6' data-id='T23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For among them are to be found those who creep into homes and captivate weak women — women who, loaded with sins, and slaves to all kinds of passions, </span>
<span class='v T23_7' data-id='T23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>are always learning, and yet never able to attain to a real knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T23_8' data-id='T23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these people, in their turn, oppose the truth. Their minds are corrupted, and, as regards the faith, they are utterly worthless. </span>
<span class='v T23_9' data-id='T23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They will not, however, make further progress; for their wicked folly will be plain to everyone, just as the folly Jannes and Jambres was. </span>
<span class='v T23_10' data-id='T23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But you, Timothy, were a close observer of my teaching, my conduct, my purposes, my faith, my forbearance, my love, and my patient endurance, </span>
<span class='v T23_11' data-id='T23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>as well as of my persecutions, and of the sufferings which I met with at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know what persecutions I underwent; and yet the Lord brought me safe out of all! </span>
<span class='v T23_12' data-id='T23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Yes, and all who aim at living a religious life in union with Christ Jesus will have to suffer persecution; </span>
<span class='v T23_13' data-id='T23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>but wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceived themselves. </span>
<span class='v T23_14' data-id='T23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You, however, must stand by what you learnt and accepted as true. You know who they were from whom you learnt it; </span>
<span class='v T23_15' data-id='T23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and that, from your childhood, you have known the sacred writings, which can give you the wisdom that, through belief in Christ Jesus, leads to salvation. </span>
<span class='v T23_16' data-id='T23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>All scripture is God-breathed: helpful for teaching, for refuting error, for giving guidance, and for training others in righteousness; </span>
<span class='v T23_17' data-id='T23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>so that God's people may be capable and equipped for good work of every kind. </span></div></div>
