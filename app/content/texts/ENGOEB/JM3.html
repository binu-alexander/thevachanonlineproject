<span class='v JM3_1' data-id='JM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Not many of you should become teachers, my friends, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly than others. </span>
<span class='v JM3_2' data-id='JM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We often make mistakes, every one of us. Anyone who does not make mistakes when speaking is indeed a perfect person, able to bridle their whole body as well. </span>
<span class='v JM3_3' data-id='JM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When we put bits into horses' mouths to make them obey us, we change their course the rest of their bodies. </span>
<span class='v JM3_4' data-id='JM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Again, think of ships. Large as they are, and even when driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder and steered in whatever direction the man at the helm may determine. </span>
<span class='v JM3_5' data-id='JM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So is it with the tongue. Small as it is, it is a great boaster. Think how a tiny spark may set the largest forest ablaze! </span>
<span class='v JM3_6' data-id='JM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is like a spark. It is a world of unrighteousness among the parts of our body. It contaminates the whole body; it sets the whole course of our existence on fire, and is itself set on fire by the flames of Gehenna. </span>
<span class='v JM3_7' data-id='JM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For while all kinds of animals, birds and reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed and have been tamed by humans, </span>
<span class='v JM3_8' data-id='JM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless plague! It is charged with deadly poison! </span>
<span class='v JM3_9' data-id='JM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made ‘in God's likeness.’ </span>
<span class='v JM3_10' data-id='JM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>From the very same mouth come blessings and curses! My friends, it is not right that this should be so. </span>
<span class='v JM3_11' data-id='JM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring give both good and bad water from the same source? </span>
<span class='v JM3_12' data-id='JM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my friends, bear olives? Or a vine bear figs? No, nor can a brackish well give good water. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM3_13' data-id='JM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who among you claims to be wise and intelligent? They should show that their actions are the outcome of a good life lived in the humility of true wisdom. </span>
<span class='v JM3_14' data-id='JM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But if you harbor bitter envy and a spirit of rivalry in your hearts, do not boast or deny the truth. </span>
<span class='v JM3_15' data-id='JM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>That is not the wisdom which comes from above; no, it is earthly, animalistic, demonic. </span>
<span class='v JM3_16' data-id='JM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For where envy and rivalry exist, there you will also find disorder and all kinds of bad, worthless actions. </span>
<span class='v JM3_17' data-id='JM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom from above is, before everything else, pure; then peace-loving, gentle, open to conviction, rich in compassion and good deeds, and free from partiality and insincerity. </span>
<span class='v JM3_18' data-id='JM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Justice is the harvest peacemakers will reap from seeds sown in a spirit of peace. </span></div></div>
