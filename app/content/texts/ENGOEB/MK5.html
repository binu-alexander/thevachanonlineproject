<span class='v MK5_1' data-id='MK5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>They came to the other side of the sea — the region of the Gerasenes; </span>
<span class='v MK5_2' data-id='MK5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and, as soon as Jesus had got out of the boat, he met a man coming out of the tombs, who was under the power of a foul spirit, </span>
<span class='v MK5_3' data-id='MK5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and who made his home in the tombs. No one had ever been able to secure him, even with a chain; </span>
<span class='v MK5_4' data-id='MK5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for, though he had many times been left secured with fetters and chains, he had snapped the chains and broken the fetters to pieces, and no one could master him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_5' data-id='MK5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Night and day alike, he was continually shrieking in the tombs and among the hills, and cutting himself with stones. </span>
<span class='v MK5_6' data-id='MK5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Catching sight of Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed to the ground before him, </span>
<span class='v MK5_7' data-id='MK5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>shrieking out in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God's sake do not torment me!” </span>
<span class='v MK5_8' data-id='MK5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had said, <span class='wj'>“Come out from the man, you foul spirit.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_9' data-id='MK5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he asked him, <span class='wj'>“What is your name?”</span> “My name,” he said, “is Legion, for there are many of us;” </span>
<span class='v MK5_10' data-id='MK5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and he begged Jesus again and again not to send them away out of that country. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_11' data-id='MK5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There was a large drove of pigs close by, feeding on the hillside; </span>
<span class='v MK5_12' data-id='MK5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and the spirits begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we can take possession of them.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_13' data-id='MK5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus gave them leave. They came out, and entered into the pigs; and the drove — about two thousand in number — rushed down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_14' data-id='MK5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the men who tended them ran away, and carried the news to the town, and to the country around; and the people went to see what had happened. </span>
<span class='v MK5_15' data-id='MK5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they found the possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind — the man who had had the ‘Legion’ in him — and they were awe-struck. </span>
<span class='v MK5_16' data-id='MK5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then those who had seen it related to them all that had happened to the possessed man, as well as about the pigs; </span>
<span class='v MK5_17' data-id='MK5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>so they began to beg Jesus to leave their region. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_18' data-id='MK5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the possessed man begged him to let him stay with him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_19' data-id='MK5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Jesus refused. <span class='wj'>“Go back to your home, to your own people,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and tell them of all that the Lord has done for you, and how he took pity on you.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_20' data-id='MK5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So the man went, and began to proclaim in the district of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_21' data-id='MK5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>By the time Jesus had recrossed in the boat to the opposite shore, a great number of people had gathered to meet him, and were standing by the sea. </span>
<span class='v MK5_22' data-id='MK5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>One of the leaders of the synagogue, whose name was Jairus, came and, as soon as he saw Jesus, threw himself at his feet and begged him repeatedly, </span>
<span class='v MK5_23' data-id='MK5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>saying, “My little daughter is at death's door. Please come and place your hands on her so that she may recover and live.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_24' data-id='MK5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with him. A great number of people followed Jesus, and kept pressing around him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_25' data-id='MK5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile a woman who for twelve years had suffered from hemorrhage, </span>
<span class='v MK5_26' data-id='MK5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and undergone much at the hands of many doctors, (spending all she had without obtaining any relief, but, on the contrary, growing worse), </span>
<span class='v MK5_27' data-id='MK5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>heard about Jesus, came behind in the crowd, and touched his cloak. </span>
<span class='v MK5_28' data-id='MK5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“If I can only touch his clothes,” she said, “I will get well!” </span>
<span class='v MK5_29' data-id='MK5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At once her bleeding stopped, and she felt in herself that she was cured of her affliction. </span>
<span class='v MK5_30' data-id='MK5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus at once became aware of the power that had gone out from him, and, turning around in the crowd, he said, <span class='wj'>“Who touched my clothes?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_31' data-id='MK5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>“You see the people pressing around you,” exclaimed his disciples, “and yet you say <span class='wj'>‘Who touched me?’ ”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_32' data-id='MK5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked about to see who had done it. </span>
<span class='v MK5_33' data-id='MK5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, in fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself down before him, and told him the whole truth. </span>
<span class='v MK5_34' data-id='MK5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Daughter,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“your faith has delivered you. Go, and peace be with you; be free from your affliction.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_35' data-id='MK5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Before he had finished speaking, some people from the house of the synagogue leader came and said, “Your daughter is dead! Why should you trouble the teacher further?” </span>
<span class='v MK5_36' data-id='MK5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, overhearing what they were saying, said to the synagogue leader, <span class='wj'>“Do not be afraid; only have faith.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_37' data-id='MK5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And he allowed no one to accompany him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. </span>
<span class='v MK5_38' data-id='MK5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Presently they reached the leader's house, where Jesus saw a scene of confusion — people weeping and wailing incessantly. </span>
<span class='v MK5_39' data-id='MK5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why this confusion and weeping?”</span> he said on entering. <span class='wj'>“The little child is not dead; she is asleep.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_40' data-id='MK5_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>They began to laugh at him; but he sent them all out, and then, with the child's father and mother and his companions, went into the room where she was lying. </span>
<span class='v MK5_41' data-id='MK5_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Taking her hand, Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Talitha, koum!”</span> — which means <span class='wj'>‘little girl, I am speaking to you — Rise!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MK5_42' data-id='MK5_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>The little girl stood up at once, and began to walk about; for she was twelve years old. And, as soon as they saw it, they were overwhelmed with amazement; </span>
<span class='v MK5_43' data-id='MK5_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>but Jesus repeatedly cautioned them not to let anyone know of it, and told them to give her something to eat. </span></div></div>
