<span class='v MK7_1' data-id='MK7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One day the Pharisees and some of the teachers of the Law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MK7_2' data-id='MK7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They had noticed that some of his disciples ate their food with their hands ‘defiled,’ by which they meant unwashed. </span>
<span class='v MK7_3' data-id='MK7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>(For the Pharisees, and indeed all strict Jews, will not eat without first scrupulously washing their hands, holding in this to the traditions of their ancestors. </span>
<span class='v MK7_4' data-id='MK7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they come from market, they will not eat without first sprinkling themselves; and there are many other customs which they have inherited and hold to, such as the ceremonial washing of cups, and jugs, and copper pans). </span>
<span class='v MK7_5' data-id='MK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law asked Jesus this question — “How is it that your disciples do not follow the traditions of our ancestors, but eat their food with defiled hands?” </span>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>His answer was, <span class='wj'>“It was well said by Isaiah when he prophesied about you hypocrites in the words — ‘This is a people who honor me with their lips, while their hearts are far removed from me;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_7' data-id='MK7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but vainly do they worship me, For they teach but human precepts.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_8' data-id='MK7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You neglect God's commandments and hold to human traditions.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_9' data-id='MK7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Wisely do you set aside God's commandments,”</span> he exclaimed, <span class='wj'>“to keep your own traditions!</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_10' data-id='MK7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For while Moses said ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Let anyone who abuses their father or mother suffer death,’</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_11' data-id='MK7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>you say ‘If a person says to their father or mother “Whatever of mine might have been of service to you is Corban” ’</span> (which means ‘Set apart for God’) — </span>
<span class='v MK7_12' data-id='MK7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>why, then you do not allow them to do anything further for their father or mother!</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_13' data-id='MK7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In this way you nullify the words of God by your traditions, which you hand down; and you do many similar things.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_14' data-id='MK7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus called the people to him again, and said, <span class='wj'>“Listen to me, all of you, and mark my words.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_15' data-id='MK7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>There is nothing external to a person, which by going into them can defile them; but the things that come out of a person are the things that defile them.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_16' data-id='MK7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='note' id='footnote-5'><a href='#note-5' class='key'>*</a></span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_17' data-id='MK7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus went indoors, away from the crowd, his disciples began questioning him about this saying. </span>
<span class='v MK7_18' data-id='MK7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“What, do even you understand so little?”</span> exclaimed Jesus. <span class='wj'>“Don't you see that there is nothing external to a person, which by going into a person, can defile them,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_19' data-id='MK7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>because it does not pass into his heart, but into his stomach, and is afterward got rid of?” — in saying this Jesus pronounced all food clean.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_20' data-id='MK7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“It is what comes out from a person,”</span> he added, <span class='wj'>“that defiles them,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_21' data-id='MK7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for it is from within, out of the hearts of people, that there come evil thoughts — sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_22' data-id='MK7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>greed, wickedness, deceit, indecency, envy, slander, haughtiness, folly;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_23' data-id='MK7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>all these wicked things come from within, and do defile a person.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_24' data-id='MK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>On leaving that place, Jesus went to the district of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, and did not wish anyone to know it, but could not escape notice. </span>
<span class='v MK7_25' data-id='MK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For a woman, whose little daughter had a foul spirit in her, heard of him immediately, and came and threw herself at his feet — </span>
<span class='v MK7_26' data-id='MK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>the woman was a foreigner, from Syrian Phoenicia — and she begged him to drive the demon out of her daughter. </span>
<span class='v MK7_27' data-id='MK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Let the children be satisfied first,”</span> answered Jesus. <span class='wj'>“For it is not fair to take the children's food, and throw it to dogs.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_28' data-id='MK7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Yes, Master,” she replied; “even the dogs under the table do feed on the children's crumbs.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_29' data-id='MK7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“For saying that,”</span> he answered, <span class='wj'>“you may go. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_30' data-id='MK7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The woman went home, and found the child lying on her bed, and the demon gone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_31' data-id='MK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>On returning from the district of Tyre, Jesus went, by way of Sidon, to the Sea of Galilee, across the district of the Ten Towns. </span>
<span class='v MK7_32' data-id='MK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Some people brought to him a man who was deaf and almost dumb, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. </span>
<span class='v MK7_33' data-id='MK7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Jesus took him aside from the crowd quietly, put his fingers into the man's ears, and touched his tongue with saliva. </span>
<span class='v MK7_34' data-id='MK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then, looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Ephphatha!”</span> which means <span class='wj'>‘Be opened.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MK7_35' data-id='MK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The man's ears were opened, the string of his tongue was freed, and he began to talk plainly. </span>
<span class='v MK7_36' data-id='MK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Jesus insisted on their not telling anyone; but the more he insisted, the more perseveringly they made it known, </span>
<span class='v MK7_37' data-id='MK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and a profound impression was made on the people. “He has done everything well!” they exclaimed. “He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak!” </span></div></div>
