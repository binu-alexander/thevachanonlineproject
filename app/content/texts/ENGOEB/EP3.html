<div class='s'>The Apostle's Divine Commission to the Gentiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_1' data-id='EP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus, the Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles — </span>
<span class='v EP3_2' data-id='EP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For you have heard, I suppose, of the responsible charge with which God entrusted me for your benefit, </span>
<span class='v EP3_3' data-id='EP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and also that it was by direct revelation that the hidden purpose of God was made known to me, as I have already briefly told you. </span>
<span class='v EP3_4' data-id='EP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And, by reading what I have written, you will be able to judge how far I understand this hidden purpose of God in Christ. </span>
<span class='v EP3_5' data-id='EP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In former generations it was not made known to humanity, as fully as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to the apostles and prophets among Christ's people — </span>
<span class='v EP3_6' data-id='EP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That, by union with Christ Jesus and through the good news, the Gentiles are coheirs with us and members of one body, and that they share with us in God's Promise. </span>
<span class='v EP3_7' data-id='EP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Of this good news I become an assistant, in virtue of the charge with which God entrusted me in the exercise of his power — </span>
<span class='v EP3_8' data-id='EP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yes, to me, who am less than the least of all Christ's people, was this charge entrusted! — to tell the Gentiles the good news of the boundless wealth to be found in the Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_9' data-id='EP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and to make clear what is God's way of working out that hidden purpose which from the first has been concealed in the mind of the Creator of all things; </span>
<span class='v EP3_10' data-id='EP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that now to the archangels and to all the powers on high should be made known, through the church, the all-embracing wisdom of God, </span>
<span class='v EP3_11' data-id='EP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>in accordance with that purpose which runs through all the ages and which he has now accomplished in Jesus, the Christ, our Master. </span>
<span class='v EP3_12' data-id='EP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And in union with him, and through our trust in him, we find courage to approach God with confidence. </span>
<span class='v EP3_13' data-id='EP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore I beg you not to be disheartened at the sufferings that I am undergoing for your sakes; for they redound to your honor. </span>
<span class='v EP3_14' data-id='EP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this reason, then, I kneel before the Father — </span>
<span class='v EP3_15' data-id='EP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>from whom all ‘fatherhood’ in heaven and on earth derives its name — </span>
<span class='v EP3_16' data-id='EP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And pray that, in proportion to the wealth of his glory, he will strengthen you with his power by breathing his Spirit into your inmost soul, </span>
<span class='v EP3_17' data-id='EP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>so that the Christ, through your faith, may make his home within your hearts in love; And I pray that you, now firmly rooted and established, may, with all Christ's people, </span>
<span class='v EP3_18' data-id='EP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>have the power to comprehend in all its width and length and height and depth, </span>
<span class='v EP3_19' data-id='EP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and to understand — though it surpasses all understanding — the love of the Christ; and so be filled to the full with God himself. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_20' data-id='EP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>To him who, through his power which is at work within us, is able to do far more than anything that we can ask or conceive — </span>
<span class='v EP3_21' data-id='EP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To him be all glory through the church and through Christ Jesus, for all generations, age after age. Amen. </span></div></div>
