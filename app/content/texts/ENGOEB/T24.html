<span class='v T24_1' data-id='T24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I solemnly charge you, in the sight of God and of Christ Jesus, who will one day judge the living and the dead — I charge you by his appearing and by his kingdom: — </span>
<span class='v T24_2' data-id='T24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Proclaim the message, be ready in season and out of season, convince, rebuke, encourage, never failing to instruct with forbearance. </span>
<span class='v T24_3' data-id='T24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For a time will come when people will not tolerate sound teaching. They will follow their own wishes, and, in their itching for novelty, procure themselves a crowd of teachers. </span>
<span class='v T24_4' data-id='T24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They will turn a deaf ear to the truth, and give their attention to legends instead. </span>
<span class='v T24_5' data-id='T24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you, Timothy, must always be temperate. Face hardships; do the work of a missionary; discharge all the duties of your office. </span></div>

<span class='v T24_6' data-id='T24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>As for me, my life blood is already being poured out; the time of my departure is close at hand. </span>
<span class='v T24_7' data-id='T24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have run the great race; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith. </span>
<span class='v T24_8' data-id='T24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And now the crown of righteousness awaits me, which the Lord, the just judge, will give me on that day — and not only to me, but to all who have loved his appearing. </span></div>

<span class='v T24_9' data-id='T24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do your utmost to come to me soon; </span>
<span class='v T24_10' data-id='T24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for Demas, in his love for the world, has deserted me. He has gone to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. </span>
<span class='v T24_11' data-id='T24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There is no one but Luke with me. Pick up Mark on your way, and bring him with you, for he is useful to me in my work. </span>

<span class='v T24_14' data-id='T24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Alexander, the coppersmith, showed much ill feeling towards me. The Lord will give him what his actions deserve. </span>

<span class='v T24_16' data-id='T24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At my first trial no one stood by me. They all deserted me. May it never be counted against them! </span>
<span class='v T24_17' data-id='T24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord came to my help and strengthened me, in order that, through me, the proclamation should be made so widely that all the Gentiles should hear it; and I was rescued out of the lion's mouth. </span>
<span class='v T24_18' data-id='T24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Lord will rescue me from all evil, and bring me safe into his Heavenly kingdom. All glory to him for ever and ever! Amen. </span></div>
