<span class='v JN8_1' data-id='JN8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>except Jesus, who went to the Mount of Olives<span class='note' id='footnote-22'><a href='#note-22' class='key'>*</a></span>. </span>
<span class='v JN8_2' data-id='JN8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But he went again into the Temple Courts early in the morning, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. </span>
<span class='v JN8_3' data-id='JN8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Presently, however, the Teachers of the Law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placed her in the middle of the Court, </span>
<span class='v JN8_4' data-id='JN8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was found in the act of adultery. </span>
<span class='v JN8_5' data-id='JN8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Moses, in the Law, commanded us to stone such women to death; what do you say?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_6' data-id='JN8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They said this to test him, in order to have a charge to bring against him. But Jesus stooped down, and wrote on the ground with his finger. </span>
<span class='v JN8_7' data-id='JN8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>However, as they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said, “Let the person among you who has never done wrong throw the first stone at her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_8' data-id='JN8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. </span>
<span class='v JN8_9' data-id='JN8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they heard that, they went out one by one, beginning with the eldest; and Jesus was left alone with the woman in the middle of the Court. </span>
<span class='v JN8_10' data-id='JN8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Raising himself, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Did no one condemn you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_11' data-id='JN8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“No one, Sir,” she answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_11' data-id='JN8_11'>“Neither do I condemn you,” said Jesus “go, and do not sin again.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_12' data-id='JN8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jesus again addressed the people. <span class='wj'>“I am the light of the world,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“The person who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_13' data-id='JN8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“You are bearing testimony to yourself!” exclaimed the Pharisees, “your testimony is not trustworthy.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_14' data-id='JN8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Even if I bear testimony to myself,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“my testimony is trustworthy; for I know where I came from, and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from, nor where I am going.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_15' data-id='JN8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You judge by appearances; I judge no one.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_16' data-id='JN8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet, even if I were to judge, my judgment would be trustworthy; because I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_17' data-id='JN8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Why, in your own Law it is said that the testimony of two persons is trustworthy.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_18' data-id='JN8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I, who bear testimony to myself, am one, and the Father who sent me also bears testimony to me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_19' data-id='JN8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Where is your father, then?”</span> they asked. <span class='wj'>“You know neither me nor my Father,”</span> replied Jesus. <span class='wj'>“If you had known me, you would have also known my Father.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_20' data-id='JN8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>These statements Jesus made in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple Courts. Yet no one arrested him, for his time had not then come. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_21' data-id='JN8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus again spoke to the people. <span class='wj'>“I am going away,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin; you cannot come where I am going.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_22' data-id='JN8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Is he going to kill himself,” the people exclaimed, “that he says — <span class='wj'>‘You cannot go where I am going’?”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_23' data-id='JN8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“You,”</span> added Jesus, <span class='wj'>“are from below, I am from above; you are of this present world, I am not;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_24' data-id='JN8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and so I told you that you would die in your sins, for, unless you believe that I am what I am, you will die in your sins.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_25' data-id='JN8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“Who are you?” they asked. <span class='wj'>“Why ask exactly what I have been telling you?”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN8_26' data-id='JN8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I have still much that concerns you to speak of and to pass judgment on; yet he who sent me may be trusted, and I speak to the world only of the things which I have heard from him.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_27' data-id='JN8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They did not understand that he meant the Father. </span>
<span class='v JN8_28' data-id='JN8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So Jesus added, <span class='wj'>“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will understand that I am what I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but that I say just what the Father has taught me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_29' data-id='JN8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Moreover, he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do what pleases him.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_30' data-id='JN8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>While he was speaking in this way, many came to believe in him. </span>
<span class='v JN8_31' data-id='JN8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went on to say to those who had believed him, <span class='wj'>“If you remain constant to my message, you are truly my disciples;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_32' data-id='JN8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and you find out the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_33' data-id='JN8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“We are descendants of Abraham,” was their answer, “and have never yet been in slavery to anyone. What do you mean by saying <span class='wj'>‘you will be set free’?”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_34' data-id='JN8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“In truth I tell you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_35' data-id='JN8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And a slave does not remain in the home always; but a son remains always.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_36' data-id='JN8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If, then, the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_37' data-id='JN8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you are seeking to put me to death, because my message finds no place in your hearts.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_38' data-id='JN8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learned from your father.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_39' data-id='JN8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>“Our father is Abraham,” was their answer. <span class='wj'>“If you are Abraham's children,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“do what Abraham did.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_40' data-id='JN8_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, as it is, you are seeking to put me to death — a man who has told you the truth as he heard it from God. Abraham did not act in that way.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_41' data-id='JN8_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You are doing what your own father does.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_41' data-id='JN8_41'>“We are not bastards,” they said, “we have one Father — God himself.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_42' data-id='JN8_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If God were your Father,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“you would have loved me, for I came out from God, and now am here; and I have not come of myself, but he sent me as his messenger.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_43' data-id='JN8_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>How is it that you do not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_44' data-id='JN8_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As for you, you are children of your Father the devil, and you are determined to do what your father loves to do. He was a murderer from the first, and did not stand by the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he lies, he does what is natural to him; because he is a liar, and the father of lying.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_45' data-id='JN8_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, as for me, it is because I speak the truth to you that you do not believe me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_46' data-id='JN8_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Which of you can convict me of sin? Why then don't you believe me, if I am speaking truth?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_47' data-id='JN8_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The person who comes from God listens to God's teaching; the reason why you do not listen is because you do not come from God.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_48' data-id='JN8_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>“Aren't we right, after all,” replied the people, “in saying that you are a Samaritan, and are possessed by a demon?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_49' data-id='JN8_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I am not possessed by a demon,”</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“but I am honoring my Father; and yet you dishonor me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_50' data-id='JN8_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Not that I am seeking honor for myself; there is one who is seeking my honor, and he decides.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_51' data-id='JN8_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In truth I tell you, if anyone lays my message to heart, he will never really die.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_52' data-id='JN8_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>“Now we are sure that you are possessed by a demon,” the people replied. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets; and yet you say <span class='wj'>‘If anyone lays my message to heart, they will never know death.’</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_53' data-id='JN8_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our ancestor Abraham, who died? And the prophets died too. Whom do you make yourself out to be?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_54' data-id='JN8_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If I do honor to myself,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“such honor counts for nothing. It is my Father who does me honor — and you say that he is your God;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_55' data-id='JN8_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and yet you have not learned to know him; but I know him; and, if I were to say that I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him, and I lay his message to heart.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_56' data-id='JN8_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Your ancestor Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_57' data-id='JN8_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>“You are not fifty years old yet,” the people exclaimed, “and have you seen Abraham?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_58' data-id='JN8_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“In truth I tell you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“before Abraham existed I was.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN8_59' data-id='JN8_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>At this they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and left the Temple Courts. </span></div></div>
