<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_1' data-id='T22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>You must, then, my child, find strength in the help which comes from the union with Christ Jesus; </span>
<span class='v T22_2' data-id='T22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and what you learnt from me, in the presence of many listeners, entrust to reliable people, who will be able in their turn to teach others. </span>
<span class='v T22_3' data-id='T22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Share hardships with me, as a true soldier of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_4' data-id='T22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>A soldier on active service, to please his superior officer, always avoids entangling himself in the affairs of ordinary life. </span>
<span class='v T22_5' data-id='T22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No athlete is ever awarded the wreath of victory unless they have kept the rules. </span>
<span class='v T22_6' data-id='T22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The laborer who does the work should be the first to receive a share of the fruits of the earth. </span>
<span class='v T22_7' data-id='T22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Reflect on what I say; the Lord will always help you to understand. </span>
<span class='v T22_8' data-id='T22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Keep before your mind Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as told in the good news entrusted to me; </span>
<span class='v T22_9' data-id='T22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>in the service of which I am suffering hardships, even to being put in fetters as a criminal. But the message of God is not fettered; </span>
<span class='v T22_10' data-id='T22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and that is why I submit to anything for the sake of God's people: so that they also may obtain the salvation which comes from union with Christ Jesus, and imperishable glory. </span>
<span class='v T22_11' data-id='T22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>How true this saying is — ‘If we have shared his death, we will also share his life. </span>
<span class='v T22_12' data-id='T22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If we continue to endure, we will also share his throne. If we should ever disown him, he, too, will disown us. </span>
<span class='v T22_13' data-id='T22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If we lose our trust, he is still to be trusted, for he cannot be false to himself!’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_14' data-id='T22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Remind people of all this; tell them solemnly, as in the sight of God, to avoid controversy, a useless thing and the ruin of those who listen to it. </span>
<span class='v T22_15' data-id='T22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do your utmost to show yourself true to God, a worker with no reason to be ashamed, accurate in delivering the message of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T22_16' data-id='T22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Avoid profane prattle. Those who indulge in it only get deeper into irreligious ways, </span>
<span class='v T22_17' data-id='T22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and their teaching will spread like a cancer. Hymenaeus and Philetus are instances of this. </span>
<span class='v T22_18' data-id='T22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They have gone completely astray as regards the truth; they say that a resurrection has already taken place, and so upset some people's faith. </span>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Yet God's firm foundation still stands unmoved, and it bears this inscription — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'>‘THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS’; </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'>and this — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'>‘LET ALL THOSE WHO USE THE NAME OF THE LORD TURN AWAY FROM WICKEDNESS.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v T22_20' data-id='T22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now in a large house there are not only things of gold and silver, but also others of wood and earthenware, some for better and some for common use. </span>
<span class='v T22_21' data-id='T22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If, then, a person has escaped from the pollution of such errors as I have mentioned, they will be like a thing kept for better use, set apart, serviceable to its owner, ready for any good purpose. </span>
<span class='v T22_22' data-id='T22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Flee from the passions of youth, but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, in the company of those who, with a pure heart, invoke the Lord. </span>
<span class='v T22_23' data-id='T22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Shun foolish and ignorant discussions, for you know that they only breed quarrels; </span>
<span class='v T22_24' data-id='T22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and a servant of the Lord should never quarrel. They ought, on the contrary, to be courteous to everyone, skillful teachers, and forbearing. </span>
<span class='v T22_25' data-id='T22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They should instruct their opponents in a gentle spirit; for, possibly, God may give those opponents a repentance that will lead to a fuller knowledge of truth, </span>
<span class='v T22_26' data-id='T22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and they may yet come to a sober mind, and escape from the devil's net, when captured by the Lord's servant to do the will of God. </span></div></div>
