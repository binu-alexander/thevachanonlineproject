<div class='c'>9</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_1' data-id='JN9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As Jesus passed by, he saw a man who had been blind from his birth. </span>
<span class='v JN9_2' data-id='JN9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Rabbi,” asked his disciples, “who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_3' data-id='JN9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Neither the man nor the parents,”</span> replied Jesus; <span class='wj'>“but he was born blind so that the work of God should be made plain in him.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_4' data-id='JN9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>We must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_5' data-id='JN9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_6' data-id='JN9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Saying this, Jesus spat on the ground, made clay with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes. </span>
<span class='v JN9_7' data-id='JN9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Go,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and wash your eyes in the Bath of Siloam”</span> (a word which means ‘messenger’). So the man went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see. </span>
<span class='v JN9_8' data-id='JN9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>His neighbors, and those who had formerly known him by sight as a beggar, exclaimed, “Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Yes,” some said, “it is”; while others said, “No, but he is like him.” The man himself said, “I am he.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_10' data-id='JN9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“How did you get your sight, then?” they asked. </span>
<span class='v JN9_11' data-id='JN9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“The man whom they call Jesus,” he answered, “made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me <span class='wj'>‘Go to Siloam and wash your eyes.’</span> So I went and washed my eyes, and gained my sight.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_12' data-id='JN9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Where is he?” they asked. “I do not know,” he answered. </span>
<span class='v JN9_13' data-id='JN9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They took the man, who had been blind, to the Pharisees. </span>
<span class='v JN9_14' data-id='JN9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and gave him his sight. </span>
<span class='v JN9_15' data-id='JN9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees also questioned the man as to how he had gained his sight. “He put clay on my eyes,” he answered, “and I washed them, and I can see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_16' data-id='JN9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“The man cannot be from God,” said some of the Pharisees, “for he does not keep the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_16' data-id='JN9_16'>“How is it possible,” retorted others, “for a bad man to give signs like this?” </span>
<span class='v JN9_17' data-id='JN9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So there was a difference of opinion among them, and they again questioned the man; “What do you yourself say about him, for it is to you that he has given sight?” </span>
<span class='v JN9_18' data-id='JN9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The religious authorities, however, refused to believe that he had been blind and had gained his sight, until they had called his parents and questioned them. </span>
<span class='v JN9_19' data-id='JN9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Is this your son,” they asked, “who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he can see now?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_20' data-id='JN9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“We know that this is our son,” answered the parents, “and that he was born blind; </span>
<span class='v JN9_21' data-id='JN9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but how it is that he can see now we do not know; nor do we know who it was that gave him his sight. Ask him — he is old enough — he will tell you about himself.” </span>
<span class='v JN9_22' data-id='JN9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>His parents spoke in this way because they were afraid of the authorities; for the authorities had already agreed that, if anyone should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be expelled from their synagogues. </span>
<span class='v JN9_23' data-id='JN9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>This was why his parents said ‘He is old enough; ask him.’ </span>
<span class='v JN9_24' data-id='JN9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So the authorities again called the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give God the praise; we know that this is a bad man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_25' data-id='JN9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“I know nothing about his being a bad man,” he replied; “one thing I do know, that although I was blind, now I can see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_26' data-id='JN9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>“What did he do to you?” they asked. “How did he give you your sight?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_27' data-id='JN9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“I told you just now,” he answered, “and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Surely you also do not want to become his disciples?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_28' data-id='JN9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“You are his disciple,” they retorted scornfully; “but we are disciples of Moses. </span>
<span class='v JN9_29' data-id='JN9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>We know that God spoke to Moses; but, as for this man, we do not know where he comes from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_30' data-id='JN9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“Well,” the man replied, “this is very strange; you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has given me my sight! </span>
<span class='v JN9_31' data-id='JN9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>We know that God never listens to bad people, but, when a person is god-fearing and does God's will, God listens to them. </span>
<span class='v JN9_32' data-id='JN9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Since the world began, such a thing was never heard of as anyone's giving sight to a person born blind. </span>
<span class='v JN9_33' data-id='JN9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>If this man had not been from God, he could not have done anything at all.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_34' data-id='JN9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“You,” they retorted, “were born totally depraved; and are you trying to teach us?” So they expelled him. </span>
<span class='v JN9_35' data-id='JN9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard of their having put him out; and, when he had found the man, he asked, <span class='wj'>“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_36' data-id='JN9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“Tell me who he is, Sir,” he replied, “so that I may believe in him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_37' data-id='JN9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Not only have you seen him,”</span> said Jesus; <span class='wj'>“but it is he who is now speaking to you.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_38' data-id='JN9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“Then, Sir, I do believe,” said the man, bowing to the ground before him; </span>
<span class='v JN9_39' data-id='JN9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>and Jesus added, <span class='wj'>“It was to put people to the test that I came into this world, in order that those that cannot see should see, and that those that can see should become blind.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN9_40' data-id='JN9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, some of the Pharisees who were with him said, “Then are we blind too?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_41' data-id='JN9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“If you had been blind,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“you would have had no sin to answer for; but, as it is, you say ‘We can see,’ and so your sin remains.</span> </span></div></div>
