<span class='v RV11_1' data-id='RV11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I was given a measure like a rod, and a voice said to me — ‘Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the worshiper there. </span>
<span class='v RV11_2' data-id='RV11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But omit the court outside the Temple, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the nations; and the holy City will be under their heel for forty-two months. </span>
<span class='v RV11_3' data-id='RV11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then I will give permission to my Two Witnesses, and for those twelve hundred and sixty days they will continue teaching, clothed in sackcloth.’ </span>
<span class='v RV11_4' data-id='RV11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>These men are represented by the two olive trees and the two lamps that stand before the Lord of the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV11_5' data-id='RV11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies; and whoever wishes to harm them will, in this way, inevitably perish. </span>
<span class='v RV11_6' data-id='RV11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>These men have the power to close the heavens, so that no rain may fall during the time that they are teaching; and they have power to turn the streams into blood, and to smite the land with any curse, whenever they will. </span>
<span class='v RV11_7' data-id='RV11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As soon as they have completed their testimony, the wild Beast that ascends from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer and kill them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_8' data-id='RV11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Their dead bodies will lie in the streets of the great city, which is mystically spoken of as ‘Sodom’ and ‘Egypt,’ where their Master was crucified. </span>
<span class='v RV11_9' data-id='RV11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>People of all nations, and tribes, and languages, and races look at their dead bodies for three days and a half, and do not allow them to be laid in a grave. </span>
<span class='v RV11_10' data-id='RV11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Those who live on the earth rejoice over them and are merry, and they will send presents to one another, because these two prophets brought torments on those who live on the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV11_11' data-id='RV11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>After three days and a half the life-giving breath of God entered these men, and they stood up on their feet, and a great terror took possession of those who were watching them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_12' data-id='RV11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The two men heard a loud voice from heaven which said to them — ‘Come up here,’ and they went up to heaven in the cloud, while their enemies watched them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_13' data-id='RV11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>At that very time a great earthquake occurred. A tenth part of the city fell, and seven thousand people perished in the earthquake. Those who escaped were much terrified, and praised the God of heaven. </span></div>

<span class='v RV11_14' data-id='RV11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The second Woe has passed; and there is a third Woe soon to follow! </span></div>

<span class='v RV11_16' data-id='RV11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At this the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, prostrated themselves on their faces and worshiped Him, </span>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>saying — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>‘We thank you, Lord, our God, the Almighty, who is and who was, that you have assumed your great power and reigned. </span>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The nations were enraged, and your wrath fell on them; the time came for the dead to be judged, and for you to give the reward to your servants the prophets, and to the people of Christ, and to those who honor your name — the high and the low alike — and to destroy those who are destroying the earth.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV11_19' data-id='RV11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark containing his covenant was seen in his Temple; and there followed flashes of lightning, cries, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and a great storm of hail. </span></div></div>
