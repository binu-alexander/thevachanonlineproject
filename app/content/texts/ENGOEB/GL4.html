<span class='v GL4_1' data-id='GL4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My point is this — As long as the heir is under age, there is no difference between him and a slave, though he is master of the whole estate. </span>
<span class='v GL4_2' data-id='GL4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He is subject to the control of guardians and stewards, during the period for which his father has power to appoint them. </span>
<span class='v GL4_3' data-id='GL4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And so is it with us; when we were under age, as it were, we were slaves to the puerile teaching of this world; </span>
<span class='v GL4_4' data-id='GL4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but, when the full time came, God sent his Son — born a woman's child, born subject to Law — </span>
<span class='v GL4_5' data-id='GL4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>To ransom those who were subject to Law, so that we might take our position as sons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_6' data-id='GL4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And it is because you are sons that God sent into our hearts the Spirit of his Son, with the cry — ‘Abba, our Father.’ </span>
<span class='v GL4_7' data-id='GL4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You, therefore, are no longer a slave, but a son; and, if a son, then an heir also, by God's appointment. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_8' data-id='GL4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yet formerly, in your ignorance of God, you became slaves to ‘gods’ which were no gods. </span>
<span class='v GL4_9' data-id='GL4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But now that you have found God — or, rather, have been found by him — how is it that you are turning back to that poor and feeble puerile teaching, to which yet once again you are wanting to become slaves? </span>
<span class='v GL4_10' data-id='GL4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You are scrupulous in keeping days and months and seasons and years! </span>
<span class='v GL4_11' data-id='GL4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You make me fear that the labor which I have spent on you may have been wasted. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_12' data-id='GL4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I entreat you, friends, to become like me, as I became like you. You have never done me any wrong. </span>
<span class='v GL4_13' data-id='GL4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You remember that it was owing to bodily infirmity that on the first occasion I told you the good news. </span>
<span class='v GL4_14' data-id='GL4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And as for what must have tried you in my condition, it did not inspire you with scorn or disgust, but you welcomed me as if I had been an angel of God — or Christ Jesus himself! </span>
<span class='v GL4_15' data-id='GL4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What has become then, of your blessings? For I can bear witness that, had it been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me! </span>
<span class='v GL4_16' data-id='GL4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Am I to think, then, that I have become your enemy by telling you the truth? </span>
<span class='v GL4_17' data-id='GL4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Certain people are seeking your favor, but with no honorable object. No, indeed, they want to isolate you, so that you will have to seek their favor. </span>
<span class='v GL4_18' data-id='GL4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is always honorable to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, and not only when I am with you, my dear children — </span>
<span class='v GL4_19' data-id='GL4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>you for whom I am again enduring a mother's pains, until a likeness to Christ will have been formed in you. </span>
<span class='v GL4_20' data-id='GL4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But I could wish to be with you now and speak in a different tone, for I am perplexed about you. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_21' data-id='GL4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Tell me, you who want to be still subject to Law — Why don't you listen to the Law? </span>
<span class='v GL4_22' data-id='GL4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Scripture says that Abraham had two sons, one the child of the slave-woman and the other the child of the free woman. </span>
<span class='v GL4_23' data-id='GL4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the child of the slave-woman was born in the course of nature, while the child of the free woman was born in fulfillment of a promise. </span>
<span class='v GL4_24' data-id='GL4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>This story may be taken as an allegory. The women stand for two Covenants. One covenant, given from Mount Sinai, produces a race of slaves and is represented by Hagar </span>
<span class='v GL4_25' data-id='GL4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>(The word Hagar meaning in Arabia Mount Sinai) and it ranks with the Jerusalem of today, for she and her children are in slavery. </span>
<span class='v GL4_26' data-id='GL4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she it is who is our mother. </span>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For scripture says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>‘Rejoice, you barren one, who does never bear, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>Break into shouts, you who are never in labor, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>For many are the children of her who is desolate — </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>aye, more than of her who has a husband.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL4_28' data-id='GL4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>As for ourselves, friends, we, like Isaac, are children born in fulfillment of a promise. </span>
<span class='v GL4_29' data-id='GL4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Yet at that time the child born in the course of nature persecuted the child born by the power of the Spirit; and it is the same now. </span>
<span class='v GL4_30' data-id='GL4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But what does the passage of scripture say? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_30' data-id='GL4_30'>‘Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slave's son will not be coheir with the son of the free woman.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL4_31' data-id='GL4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And so, friends, we are not children of a slave, but of her who is free. </span></div></div>
