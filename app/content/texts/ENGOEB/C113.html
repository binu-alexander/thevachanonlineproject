<span class='v C113_1' data-id='C113_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Though I speak in the ‘tongues’ of people, or even of angels, yet have not love, I have become mere echoing brass, or a clanging cymbal! </span>
<span class='v C113_2' data-id='C113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Even though I have the gift of preaching, and fathom all hidden truths and all the depths of knowledge; even though I have such faith as might move mountains, yet have not love, I am nothing! </span>
<span class='v C113_3' data-id='C113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Even though I dole my substance to the poor, even though I sacrifice my body in order to boast, yet have not love, it avails me nothing! </span>
<span class='v C113_4' data-id='C113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Love is long-suffering, and kind; love is never envious, never boastful, never conceited, never behaves unbecomingly; </span>
<span class='v C113_5' data-id='C113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>love is never self-seeking, never provoked, never reckons up her wrongs; </span>
<span class='v C113_6' data-id='C113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>love never rejoices at evil, but rejoices in the triumph of truth; </span>
<span class='v C113_7' data-id='C113_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>love bears with all things, ever trustful, ever hopeful, ever patient. </span>
<span class='v C113_8' data-id='C113_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Love never fails. But, whether it be the gift of preaching, it will be done with; whether it be the gift of ‘tongues,’ it will cease; whether it be knowledge, it, too, will be done with. </span>
<span class='v C113_9' data-id='C113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For our knowledge is incomplete, and our preaching is incomplete, </span>
<span class='v C113_10' data-id='C113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but, when the perfect has come, that which is incomplete will be done with. </span>
<span class='v C113_11' data-id='C113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I talked as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; now that I am a man, I have done with childish ways. </span>
<span class='v C113_12' data-id='C113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As yet we see, in a mirror, dimly, but then — face to face! As yet my knowledge is incomplete, but then I will know in full, as I have been fully known. </span>
<span class='v C113_13' data-id='C113_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile faith, hope, and love endure — these three, but the greatest of these is love. </span></div></div>
