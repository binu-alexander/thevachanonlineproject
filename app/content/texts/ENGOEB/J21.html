<div class='s'>Greetings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_1' data-id='J21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well. </span>
<span class='v J21_2' data-id='J21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_3' data-id='J21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours — the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father's Son — in truth and love. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Live in truth and love </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_4' data-id='J21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father. </span>
<span class='v J21_5' data-id='J21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. — Let us love one another. </span>
<span class='v J21_6' data-id='J21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And this is love — to live in obedience to the Father's commands. This is the command as you learned from the beginning, to live a life of love. </span>
<span class='v J21_7' data-id='J21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world — men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist. </span>
<span class='v J21_8' data-id='J21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward. </span>
<span class='v J21_9' data-id='J21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching — they have both the Father and the Son. </span>
<span class='v J21_10' data-id='J21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them; </span>
<span class='v J21_11' data-id='J21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_12' data-id='J21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. </span>
<span class='v J21_13' data-id='J21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings. </span></div></div>
