<span class='v T12_1' data-id='T12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>First of all, then, I ask that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings should be offered for everyone, </span>
<span class='v T12_2' data-id='T12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>especially for kings and all who are in high positions, in order that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in a deeply religious and reverent spirit. </span>
<span class='v T12_3' data-id='T12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This will be good and acceptable in the eyes of God, our Savior, </span>
<span class='v T12_4' data-id='T12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>whose will is that everyone should be saved, and attain to a full knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T12_5' data-id='T12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>There is but one God, and one mediator between God and humanity — the human, Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v T12_6' data-id='T12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who gave himself as a ransom on behalf of all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T12_6' data-id='T12_6'>This must be our testimony, as opportunities present themselves; </span>
<span class='v T12_7' data-id='T12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and it was for this that I was myself appointed a herald and an apostle (I am telling the simple truth and no lie) — a teacher of the Gentiles in the faith and truth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T12_8' data-id='T12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>My desire, then, is that it should be the custom everywhere for the men to lead the prayers, with hands reverently uplifted, avoiding heated controversy. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T12_9' data-id='T12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I also desire that women should adorn themselves with appropriate dress, worn quietly and modestly, and not with wreaths or gold ornaments for the hair, or pearls, or costly clothing, </span>
<span class='v T12_10' data-id='T12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but — as is proper for women who profess to be religious — with good actions. </span>
<span class='v T12_11' data-id='T12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They must learn, listening quietly to their teachers and showing them all deference. </span>
<span class='v T12_12' data-id='T12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I do not consent to them becoming teachers, or exercising authority over men; they ought to not make a fuss. </span>
<span class='v T12_13' data-id='T12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Adam was formed first, not Eve. </span>
<span class='v T12_14' data-id='T12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And it was not Adam who was deceived; it was the woman who was entirely deceived and fell into sin. </span>
<span class='v T12_15' data-id='T12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But she will be saved by the birth of a child, if they never abandon faith, love, or holiness, and behave with modesty. </span></div></div>
