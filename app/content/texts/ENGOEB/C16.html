<div class='p'>
<span class='v C16_1' data-id='C16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Can it be that, when one of you has a dispute with another, they dare to have their case tried before the heathen, instead of before Christ's people? </span>
<span class='v C16_2' data-id='C16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Don't you know that Christ's people will try the world? And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try the most trivial cases? </span>
<span class='v C16_3' data-id='C16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Don't you know that we are to try angels — to say nothing of the affairs of this life? </span>
<span class='v C16_4' data-id='C16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Why, then, if you have cases relating to the affairs of this life, do you set to try them those who carry no weight with the church? To your shame I ask it. </span>
<span class='v C16_5' data-id='C16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Can it be that there is not one among you wise enough to decide between two of their fellow followers? </span>
<span class='v C16_6' data-id='C16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Must a follower sue a fellow follower? In front of unbelievers? </span>
<span class='v C16_7' data-id='C16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To begin with, it is undoubtedly a loss to you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather let yourselves be wronged? Why not rather let yourselves be cheated? </span>
<span class='v C16_8' data-id='C16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Instead of this, you wrong and cheat others yourselves — yes, even other followers! </span>
<span class='v C16_9' data-id='C16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Don't you know that wrong-doers will have no share in God's kingdom? Do not be deceived. No one who is immoral, or an idolater, or an adulterer, or licentious, or a sexual pervert, </span>
<span class='v C16_10' data-id='C16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>or a thief, or covetous, or a drunkard, or abusive, or grasping, will have any share in God's kingdom. </span>
<span class='v C16_11' data-id='C16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Such some of you used to be; but you washed yourselves clean. You became Christ's people! You were pronounced righteous through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and through the Spirit of our God! </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C16_12' data-id='C16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but everything is not profitable. Everything is allowable for me! Yes, but for my part, I will not let myself be enslaved by anything. </span>
<span class='v C16_13' data-id='C16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Food exists for the stomach, and the stomach for food; but God will put an end to both the one and the other. The body, however, exists, not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body; </span>
<span class='v C16_14' data-id='C16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and, as God has raised the Lord, so he will raise up us also by the exercise of his power. </span>
<span class='v C16_15' data-id='C16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Don't you know that your bodies are Christ's members? Am I, then, to take the members that belong to the Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? Heaven forbid! </span>
<span class='v C16_16' data-id='C16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Or don't you know that a man who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body (for ‘the two,’ it is said, ‘will become one’); </span>
<span class='v C16_17' data-id='C16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>while a man who is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit? </span>
<span class='v C16_18' data-id='C16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Shun all immorality. Every other sin that people commit is something outside the body; but an immoral person sins against their own body. </span>
<span class='v C16_19' data-id='C16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Again, don't you know that your body is a shrine of the Holy Spirit that is within you – the Spirit which you have from God? </span>
<span class='v C16_20' data-id='C16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Moreover, you are not your own masters; you were bought, and the price was paid. Therefore, honor God in your bodies. </span></div></div>
