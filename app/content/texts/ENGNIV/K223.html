<div class='s'>Josiah Renews the Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_1' data-id='K223_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the king called together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K223_2' data-id='K223_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He went up to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and the prophets—all the people from the least to the greatest. He read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant, which had been found in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K223_3' data-id='K223_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>—to follow the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and keep his commands, statutes and decrees with all his heart and all his soul, thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book. Then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_4' data-id='K223_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> all the articles made for Baal and Asherah and all the starry hosts. He burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron Valley and took the ashes to Bethel. </span>
<span class='v K223_5' data-id='K223_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He did away with the idolatrous priests appointed by the kings of Judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of Judah and on those around Jerusalem—those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and moon, to the constellations and to all the starry hosts. </span>
<span class='v K223_6' data-id='K223_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He took the Asherah pole from the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem and burned it there. He ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people. </span>
<span class='v K223_7' data-id='K223_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes that were in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the quarters where women did weaving for Asherah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_8' data-id='K223_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Josiah brought all the priests from the towns of Judah and desecrated the high places, from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He broke down the gateway at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua, the city governor, which was on the left of the city gate. </span>
<span class='v K223_9' data-id='K223_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in Jerusalem, they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_10' data-id='K223_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He desecrated Topheth, which was in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could use it to sacrifice their son or daughter in the fire to Molek. </span>
<span class='v K223_11' data-id='K223_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He removed from the entrance to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were in the court<span class='note' id='footnote-985'><a href='#note-985' class='key'>*</a></span> near the room of an official named Nathan-Melek. Josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_12' data-id='K223_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He pulled down the altars the kings of Judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of Ahaz, and the altars Manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. He removed them from there, smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the Kidron Valley. </span>
<span class='v K223_13' data-id='K223_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The king also desecrated the high places that were east of Jerusalem on the south of the Hill of Corruption—the ones Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the vile goddess of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the vile god of Moab, and for Molek the detestable god of the people of Ammon. </span>
<span class='v K223_14' data-id='K223_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the Asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_15' data-id='K223_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Even the altar at Bethel, the high place made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin—even that altar and high place he demolished. He burned the high place and ground it to powder, and burned the Asherah pole also. </span>
<span class='v K223_16' data-id='K223_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Josiah looked around, and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside, he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it, in accordance with the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> proclaimed by the man of God who foretold these things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_17' data-id='K223_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The king asked, “What is that tombstone I see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_17' data-id='K223_17'>The people of the city said, “It marks the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and pronounced against the altar of Bethel the very things you have done to it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_18' data-id='K223_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“Leave it alone,” he said. “Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from Samaria. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_19' data-id='K223_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Just as he had done at Bethel, Josiah removed all the shrines at the high places that the kings of Israel had built in the towns of Samaria and that had aroused the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger. </span>
<span class='v K223_20' data-id='K223_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them. Then he went back to Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_21' data-id='K223_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The king gave this order to all the people: “Celebrate the Passover to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.” </span>
<span class='v K223_22' data-id='K223_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Neither in the days of the judges who led Israel nor in the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah had any such Passover been observed. </span>
<span class='v K223_23' data-id='K223_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, this Passover was celebrated to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_24' data-id='K223_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, Josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists, the household gods, the idols and all the other detestable things seen in Judah and Jerusalem. This he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K223_25' data-id='K223_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as he did—with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_26' data-id='K223_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger, which burned against Judah because of all that Manasseh had done to arouse his anger. </span>
<span class='v K223_27' data-id='K223_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “I will remove Judah also from my presence as I removed Israel, and I will reject Jerusalem, the city I chose, and this temple, about which I said, ‘My Name shall be there.’<span class='note' id='footnote-986'><a href='#note-986' class='key'>†</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_28' data-id='K223_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of Josiah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_29' data-id='K223_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went up to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out to meet him in battle, but Necho faced him and killed him at Megiddo. </span>
<span class='v K223_30' data-id='K223_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Josiah’s servants brought his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jehoahaz King of Judah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_31' data-id='K223_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. </span>
<span class='v K223_32' data-id='K223_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, just as his predecessors had done. </span>
<span class='v K223_33' data-id='K223_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he might not reign in Jerusalem, and he imposed on Judah a levy of a hundred talents<span class='note' id='footnote-987'><a href='#note-987' class='key'>‡</a></span> of silver and a talent<span class='note' id='footnote-988'><a href='#note-988' class='key'>§</a></span> of gold. </span>
<span class='v K223_34' data-id='K223_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But he took Jehoahaz and carried him off to Egypt, and there he died. </span>
<span class='v K223_35' data-id='K223_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jehoiakim paid Pharaoh Necho the silver and gold he demanded. In order to do so, he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K223_36' data-id='K223_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah. </span>
<span class='v K223_37' data-id='K223_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And he did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, just as his predecessors had done. </span></div></div>
