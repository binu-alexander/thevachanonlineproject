<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_1' data-id='S11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>There was a certain man from Ramathaim, a Zuphite<span class='note' id='footnote-674'><a href='#note-674' class='key'>*</a></span> from the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. </span>
<span class='v S11_2' data-id='S11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He had two wives; one was called Hannah and the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_3' data-id='S11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S11_4' data-id='S11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Whenever the day came for Elkanah to sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters. </span>
<span class='v S11_5' data-id='S11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had closed her womb. </span>
<span class='v S11_6' data-id='S11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had closed Hannah’s womb, her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her. </span>
<span class='v S11_7' data-id='S11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This went on year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat. </span>
<span class='v S11_8' data-id='S11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Her husband Elkanah would say to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why don’t you eat? Why are you downhearted? Don’t I mean more to you than ten sons?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_9' data-id='S11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Once when they had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s house. </span>
<span class='v S11_10' data-id='S11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In her deep anguish Hannah prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, weeping bitterly. </span>
<span class='v S11_11' data-id='S11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And she made a vow, saying, “<span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, if you will only look on your servant’s misery and remember me, and not forget your servant but give her a son, then I will give him to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for all the days of his life, and no razor will ever be used on his head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_12' data-id='S11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As she kept on praying to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth. </span>
<span class='v S11_13' data-id='S11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Hannah was praying in her heart, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk </span>
<span class='v S11_14' data-id='S11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and said to her, “How long are you going to stay drunk? Put away your wine.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_15' data-id='S11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Not so, my lord,” Hannah replied, “I am a woman who is deeply troubled. I have not been drinking wine or beer; I was pouring out my soul to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S11_16' data-id='S11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Do not take your servant for a wicked woman; I have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_17' data-id='S11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_18' data-id='S11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>She said, “May your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_19' data-id='S11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and then went back to their home at Ramah. Elkanah made love to his wife Hannah, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> remembered her. </span>
<span class='v S11_20' data-id='S11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So in the course of time Hannah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel,<span class='note' id='footnote-675'><a href='#note-675' class='key'>†</a></span> saying, “Because I asked the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Hannah Dedicates Samuel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_21' data-id='S11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When her husband Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and to fulfill his vow, </span>
<span class='v S11_22' data-id='S11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him and present him before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he will live there always.”<span class='note' id='footnote-676'><a href='#note-676' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_23' data-id='S11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“Do what seems best to you,” her husband Elkanah told her. “Stay here until you have weaned him; only may the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> make good his<span class='note' id='footnote-677'><a href='#note-677' class='key'>§</a></span> word.” So the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_24' data-id='S11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After he was weaned, she took the boy with her, young as he was, along with a three-year-old bull,<span class='note' id='footnote-678'><a href='#note-678' class='key'>*</a></span> an ephah<span class='note' id='footnote-679'><a href='#note-679' class='key'>†</a></span> of flour and a skin of wine, and brought him to the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> at Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v S11_25' data-id='S11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When the bull had been sacrificed, they brought the boy to Eli, </span>
<span class='v S11_26' data-id='S11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and she said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, I am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S11_27' data-id='S11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>I prayed for this child, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has granted me what I asked of him. </span>
<span class='v S11_28' data-id='S11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So now I give him to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. For his whole life he will be given over to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” And he worshiped the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> there. </span></div></div>
