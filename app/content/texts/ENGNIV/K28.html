<div class='s'>The Shunammite’s Land Restored </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_1' data-id='K28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life, “Go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years.” </span>
<span class='v K28_2' data-id='K28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The woman proceeded to do as the man of God said. She and her family went away and stayed in the land of the Philistines seven years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_3' data-id='K28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>At the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the Philistines and went to appeal to the king for her house and land. </span>
<span class='v K28_4' data-id='K28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, and had said, “Tell me about all the great things Elisha has done.” </span>
<span class='v K28_5' data-id='K28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Just as Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had restored the dead to life, the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came to appeal to the king for her house and land. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_5' data-id='K28_5'>Gehazi said, “This is the woman, my lord the king, and this is her son whom Elisha restored to life.” </span>
<span class='v K28_6' data-id='K28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The king asked the woman about it, and she told him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_6' data-id='K28_6'>Then he assigned an official to her case and said to him, “Give back everything that belonged to her, including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Hazael Murders Ben-Hadad </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_7' data-id='K28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Elisha went to Damascus, and Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill. When the king was told, “The man of God has come all the way up here,” </span>
<span class='v K28_8' data-id='K28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>he said to Hazael, “Take a gift with you and go to meet the man of God. Consult the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> through him; ask him, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_9' data-id='K28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a gift forty camel-loads of all the finest wares of Damascus. He went in and stood before him, and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask, ‘Will I recover from this illness?’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_10' data-id='K28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Elisha answered, “Go and say to him, ‘You will certainly recover.’ Nevertheless,<span class='note' id='footnote-940'><a href='#note-940' class='key'>*</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has revealed to me that he will in fact die.” </span>
<span class='v K28_11' data-id='K28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He stared at him with a fixed gaze until Hazael was embarrassed. Then the man of God began to weep. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_12' data-id='K28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Why is my lord weeping?” asked Hazael. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_12' data-id='K28_12'>“Because I know the harm you will do to the Israelites,” he answered. “You will set fire to their fortified places, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_13' data-id='K28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog, accomplish such a feat?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_13' data-id='K28_13'>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has shown me that you will become king of Aram,” answered Elisha. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_14' data-id='K28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Hazael left Elisha and returned to his master. When Ben-Hadad asked, “What did Elisha say to you?” Hazael replied, “He told me that you would certainly recover.” </span>
<span class='v K28_15' data-id='K28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the next day he took a thick cloth, soaked it in water and spread it over the king’s face, so that he died. Then Hazael succeeded him as king. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jehoram King of Judah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_16' data-id='K28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, when Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat began his reign as king of Judah. </span>
<span class='v K28_17' data-id='K28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. </span>
<span class='v K28_18' data-id='K28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K28_19' data-id='K28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, for the sake of his servant David, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not willing to destroy Judah. He had promised to maintain a lamp for David and his descendants forever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_20' data-id='K28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. </span>
<span class='v K28_21' data-id='K28_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So Jehoram<span class='note' id='footnote-941'><a href='#note-941' class='key'>†</a></span> went to Zair with all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night; his army, however, fled back home. </span>
<span class='v K28_22' data-id='K28_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. Libnah revolted at the same time. </span></div>

<span class='v K28_23' data-id='K28_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of Jehoram’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? </span>
<span class='v K28_24' data-id='K28_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jehoram rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Ahaziah his son succeeded him as king. </span></div>

<span class='v K28_26' data-id='K28_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K28_27' data-id='K28_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He followed the ways of the house of Ahab and did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, as the house of Ahab had done, for he was related by marriage to Ahab’s family. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K28_28' data-id='K28_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth Gilead. The Arameans wounded Joram; </span>
