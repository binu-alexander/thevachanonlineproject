<span class='v LV21_5' data-id='LV21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies. </span>
<span class='v LV21_6' data-id='LV21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They must be holy to their God and must not profane the name of their God. Because they present the food offerings to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the food of their God, they are to be holy. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV21_7' data-id='LV21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“ ‘They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God. </span>
<span class='v LV21_8' data-id='LV21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Regard them as holy, because they offer up the food of your God. Consider them holy, because I the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> am holy—I who make you holy. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV21_9' data-id='LV21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“ ‘If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she disgraces her father; she must be burned in the fire. </span></div>

<span class='v LV21_10' data-id='LV21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“ ‘The high priest, the one among his brothers who has had the anointing oil poured on his head and who has been ordained to wear the priestly garments, must not let his hair become unkempt<span class='note' id='footnote-398'><a href='#note-398' class='key'>†</a></span> or tear his clothes. </span>
<span class='v LV21_11' data-id='LV21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He must not enter a place where there is a dead body. He must not make himself unclean, even for his father or mother, </span>
<span class='v LV21_12' data-id='LV21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, because he has been dedicated by the anointing oil of his God. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV21_13' data-id='LV21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“ ‘The woman he marries must be a virgin. </span>
<span class='v LV21_14' data-id='LV21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but only a virgin from his own people, </span>
<span class='v LV21_15' data-id='LV21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>so that he will not defile his offspring among his people. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who makes him holy.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV21_16' data-id='LV21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v LV21_17' data-id='LV21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Say to Aaron: ‘For the generations to come none of your descendants who has a defect may come near to offer the food of his God. </span>
<span class='v LV21_18' data-id='LV21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>No man who has any defect may come near: no man who is blind or lame, disfigured or deformed; </span>
<span class='v LV21_19' data-id='LV21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>no man with a crippled foot or hand, </span>
<span class='v LV21_20' data-id='LV21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has any eye defect, or who has festering or running sores or damaged testicles. </span>
<span class='v LV21_21' data-id='LV21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the food offerings to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God. </span>
<span class='v LV21_22' data-id='LV21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He may eat the most holy food of his God, as well as the holy food; </span>
<span class='v LV21_23' data-id='LV21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>yet because of his defect, he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar, and so desecrate my sanctuary. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who makes them holy.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV21_24' data-id='LV21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Moses told this to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites. </span></div></div>
