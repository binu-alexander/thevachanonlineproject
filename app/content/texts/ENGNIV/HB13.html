<span class='v HB13_2' data-id='HB13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. </span>
<span class='v HB13_3' data-id='HB13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Continue to remember those in prison as if you were together with them in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB13_4' data-id='HB13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. </span>
<span class='v HB13_5' data-id='HB13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB13_7' data-id='HB13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. </span>
<span class='v HB13_8' data-id='HB13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB13_9' data-id='HB13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings. It is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace, not by eating ceremonial foods, which is of no benefit to those who do so. </span>
<span class='v HB13_10' data-id='HB13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>We have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat. </span></div>

<span class='v HB13_12' data-id='HB13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And so Jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood. </span>

<span class='v HB13_15' data-id='HB13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name. </span>
<span class='v HB13_16' data-id='HB13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB13_17' data-id='HB13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account.

<span class='v HB13_21' data-id='HB13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>equip you with everything good for doing his will, and may he work in us what is pleasing to him, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>

<span class='v HB13_22' data-id='HB13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Brothers and sisters, I urge you to bear with my word of exhortation, for in fact I have written to you quite briefly. </span></div>
