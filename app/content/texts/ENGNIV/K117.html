<div class='s'>Elijah Announces a Great Drought </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_1' data-id='K117_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe<span class='note' id='footnote-912'><a href='#note-912' class='key'>*</a></span> in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Elijah Fed by Ravens </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_2' data-id='K117_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Elijah: </span>
<span class='v K117_3' data-id='K117_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v K117_4' data-id='K117_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_5' data-id='K117_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So he did what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had told him. He went to the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan, and stayed there. </span>
<span class='v K117_6' data-id='K117_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Elijah and the Widow at Zarephath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_7' data-id='K117_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land. </span>
<span class='v K117_8' data-id='K117_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to him: </span>
<span class='v K117_9' data-id='K117_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there. I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.” </span>
<span class='v K117_10' data-id='K117_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So he went to Zarephath. When he came to the town gate, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her and asked, “Would you bring me a little water in a jar so I may have a drink?” </span>
<span class='v K117_11' data-id='K117_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As she was going to get it, he called, “And bring me, please, a piece of bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_12' data-id='K117_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“As surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God lives,” she replied, “I don’t have any bread—only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug. I am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son, that we may eat it—and die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_13' data-id='K117_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go home and do as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me, and then make something for yourself and your son. </span>
<span class='v K117_14' data-id='K117_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sends rain on the land.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_15' data-id='K117_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>She went away and did as Elijah had told her. So there was food every day for Elijah and for the woman and her family. </span>
<span class='v K117_16' data-id='K117_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry, in keeping with the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoken by Elijah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_17' data-id='K117_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. He grew worse and worse, and finally stopped breathing. </span>
<span class='v K117_18' data-id='K117_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>She said to Elijah, “What do you have against me, man of God? Did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_19' data-id='K117_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Give me your son,” Elijah replied. He took him from her arms, carried him to the upper room where he was staying, and laid him on his bed. </span>
<span class='v K117_20' data-id='K117_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “<span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God, have you brought tragedy even on this widow I am staying with, by causing her son to die?” </span>
<span class='v K117_21' data-id='K117_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “<span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God, let this boy’s life return to him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_22' data-id='K117_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> heard Elijah’s cry, and the boy’s life returned to him, and he lived. </span>
<span class='v K117_23' data-id='K117_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house. He gave him to his mother and said, “Look, your son is alive!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K117_24' data-id='K117_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> from your mouth is the truth.” </span></div></div>
