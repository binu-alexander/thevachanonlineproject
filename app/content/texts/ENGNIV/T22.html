<div class='s'>The Appeal Renewed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_1' data-id='T22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>You then, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_2' data-id='T22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others. </span>
<span class='v T22_3' data-id='T22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Join with me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_4' data-id='T22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in civilian affairs, but rather tries to please his commanding officer. </span>
<span class='v T22_5' data-id='T22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Similarly, anyone who competes as an athlete does not receive the victor’s crown except by competing according to the rules. </span>
<span class='v T22_6' data-id='T22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops. </span>
<span class='v T22_7' data-id='T22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Reflect on what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all this. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_8' data-id='T22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel, </span>
<span class='v T22_9' data-id='T22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>for which I am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal. But God’s word is not chained. </span>
<span class='v T22_10' data-id='T22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. </span></div>

<span class='v T22_11' data-id='T22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Here is a trustworthy saying: </span></div>

<span class='v T22_13' data-id='T22_13'>for he cannot disown himself. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Dealing With False Teachers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_14' data-id='T22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Keep reminding God’s people of these things. Warn them before God against quarreling about words; it is of no value, and only ruins those who listen. </span>
<span class='v T22_15' data-id='T22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth. </span>
<span class='v T22_16' data-id='T22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Avoid godless chatter, because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly. </span>
<span class='v T22_17' data-id='T22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Their teaching will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, </span>
<span class='v T22_18' data-id='T22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>who have departed from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and they destroy the faith of some. </span>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, sealed with this inscription: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_20' data-id='T22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay; some are for special purposes and some for common use. </span>
<span class='v T22_21' data-id='T22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Those who cleanse themselves from the latter will be instruments for special purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_22' data-id='T22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. </span>
<span class='v T22_23' data-id='T22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. </span>
<span class='v T22_24' data-id='T22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. </span>
<span class='v T22_25' data-id='T22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, </span>
<span class='v T22_26' data-id='T22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will. </span></div></div>
