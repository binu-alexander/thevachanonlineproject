<span class='v EK34_1' data-id='EK34_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK34_2' data-id='EK34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Woe to you shepherds of Israel who only take care of yourselves! Should not shepherds take care of the flock? </span>
<span class='v EK34_3' data-id='EK34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You eat the curds, clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals, but you do not take care of the flock. </span>
<span class='v EK34_4' data-id='EK34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. You have ruled them harshly and brutally. </span>
<span class='v EK34_5' data-id='EK34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So they were scattered because there was no shepherd, and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals. </span>
<span class='v EK34_6' data-id='EK34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>My sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill. They were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them. </span></div>

<span class='v EK34_7' data-id='EK34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v EK34_8' data-id='EK34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock, </span>
<span class='v EK34_9' data-id='EK34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v EK34_10' data-id='EK34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them. </span></div>

<span class='v EK34_12' data-id='EK34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. </span>
<span class='v EK34_13' data-id='EK34_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land.

<span class='v EK34_14' data-id='EK34_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will tend them in a good pasture, and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK34_15' data-id='EK34_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v EK34_16' data-id='EK34_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I will search for the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but the sleek and the strong I will destroy. I will shepherd the flock with justice. </span></div>

<span class='v EK34_21' data-id='EK34_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away, </span>
