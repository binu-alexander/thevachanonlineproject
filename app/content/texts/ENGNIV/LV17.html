<span class='v LV17_5' data-id='LV17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is so the Israelites will bring to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields. They must bring them to the priest, that is, to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings. </span>
<span class='v LV17_6' data-id='LV17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The priest is to splash the blood against the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV17_7' data-id='LV17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols<span class='note' id='footnote-390'><a href='#note-390' class='key'>†</a></span> to whom they prostitute themselves.
