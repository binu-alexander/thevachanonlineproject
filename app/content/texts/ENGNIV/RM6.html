<div class='s'>Dead to Sin, Alive in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_1' data-id='RM6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? </span>
<span class='v RM6_2' data-id='RM6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By no means! We are those who have died to sin; how can we live in it any longer? </span>
<span class='v RM6_3' data-id='RM6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Or don’t you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? </span>
<span class='v RM6_4' data-id='RM6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_5' data-id='RM6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his. </span>
<span class='v RM6_6' data-id='RM6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away with,<span class='note' id='footnote-2880'><a href='#note-2880' class='key'>*</a></span> that we should no longer be slaves to sin— </span>
<span class='v RM6_7' data-id='RM6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>because anyone who has died has been set free from sin. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_8' data-id='RM6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. </span>
<span class='v RM6_9' data-id='RM6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. </span>
<span class='v RM6_10' data-id='RM6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_11' data-id='RM6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In the same way, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v RM6_12' data-id='RM6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires. </span>
<span class='v RM6_13' data-id='RM6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM6_14' data-id='RM6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Slaves to Righteousness </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_15' data-id='RM6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! </span>
<span class='v RM6_16' data-id='RM6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? </span>
<span class='v RM6_17' data-id='RM6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you have come to obey from your heart the pattern of teaching that has now claimed your allegiance. </span>
<span class='v RM6_18' data-id='RM6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM6_19' data-id='RM6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I am using an example from everyday life because of your human limitations. Just as you used to offer yourselves as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so now offer yourselves as slaves to righteousness leading to holiness. </span>
<span class='v RM6_20' data-id='RM6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM6_21' data-id='RM6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? Those things result in death! </span>
<span class='v RM6_22' data-id='RM6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life. </span>
