<div class='s'>Day of Disaster </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_1' data-id='JR16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v JR16_2' data-id='JR16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“You must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place.” </span>
<span class='v JR16_3' data-id='JR16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers: </span>
<span class='v JR16_4' data-id='JR16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“They will die of deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like dung lying on the ground. They will perish by sword and famine, and their dead bodies will become food for the birds and the wild animals.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_5' data-id='JR16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: “Do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal; do not go to mourn or show sympathy, because I have withdrawn my blessing, my love and my pity from this people,” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JR16_6' data-id='JR16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Both high and low will die in this land. They will not be buried or mourned, and no one will cut themselves or shave their head for the dead. </span>
<span class='v JR16_7' data-id='JR16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>No one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead—not even for a father or a mother—nor will anyone give them a drink to console them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_8' data-id='JR16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“And do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink. </span>
<span class='v JR16_9' data-id='JR16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Before your eyes and in your days I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_10' data-id='JR16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“When you tell these people all this and they ask you, ‘Why has the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> decreed such a great disaster against us? What wrong have we done? What sin have we committed against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God?’ </span>
<span class='v JR16_11' data-id='JR16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>then say to them, ‘It is because your ancestors forsook me,’ declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, ‘and followed other gods and served and worshiped them. They forsook me and did not keep my law. </span>
<span class='v JR16_12' data-id='JR16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But you have behaved more wickedly than your ancestors. See how all of you are following the stubbornness of your evil hearts instead of obeying me. </span>
<span class='v JR16_13' data-id='JR16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So I will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you will serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_14' data-id='JR16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“However, the days are coming,” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “when it will no longer be said, ‘As surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of Egypt,’ </span>
<span class='v JR16_15' data-id='JR16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>but it will be said, ‘As surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives, who brought the Israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them.’ For I will restore them to the land I gave their ancestors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR16_16' data-id='JR16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“But now I will send for many fishermen,” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “and they will catch them. After that I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks. </span>
<span class='v JR16_17' data-id='JR16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from me, nor is their sin concealed from my eyes. </span>
<span class='v JR16_18' data-id='JR16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols.” </span></div>
