<div class='s'>The Ordination of Aaron and His Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_1' data-id='LV8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v LV8_2' data-id='LV8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering,<span class='note' id='footnote-369'><a href='#note-369' class='key'>*</a></span> the two rams and the basket containing bread made without yeast, </span>
<span class='v LV8_3' data-id='LV8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and gather the entire assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting.” </span>
<span class='v LV8_4' data-id='LV8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Moses did as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded him, and the assembly gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_5' data-id='LV8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Moses said to the assembly, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has commanded to be done.” </span>
<span class='v LV8_6' data-id='LV8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water. </span>
<span class='v LV8_7' data-id='LV8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, which he tied around him. </span>
<span class='v LV8_8' data-id='LV8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece. </span>
<span class='v LV8_9' data-id='LV8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he placed the turban on Aaron’s head and set the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of it, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_10' data-id='LV8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, and so consecrated them. </span>
<span class='v LV8_11' data-id='LV8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them. </span>
<span class='v LV8_12' data-id='LV8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. </span>
<span class='v LV8_13' data-id='LV8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he brought Aaron’s sons forward, put tunics on them, tied sashes around them and fastened caps on them, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_14' data-id='LV8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He then presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </span>
<span class='v LV8_15' data-id='LV8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of the blood, and with his finger he put it on all the horns of the altar to purify the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar. So he consecrated it to make atonement for it. </span>
<span class='v LV8_16' data-id='LV8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Moses also took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and both kidneys and their fat, and burned it on the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV8_17' data-id='LV8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the bull with its hide and its flesh and its intestines he burned up outside the camp, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_18' data-id='LV8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </span>
<span class='v LV8_19' data-id='LV8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV8_20' data-id='LV8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces and the fat. </span>
<span class='v LV8_21' data-id='LV8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He washed the internal organs and the legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_22' data-id='LV8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He then presented the other ram, the ram for the ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head. </span>
<span class='v LV8_23' data-id='LV8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot. </span>
<span class='v LV8_24' data-id='LV8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Moses also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Then he splashed blood against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV8_25' data-id='LV8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>After that, he took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, both kidneys and their fat and the right thigh. </span>
<span class='v LV8_26' data-id='LV8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And from the basket of bread made without yeast, which was before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, he took one thick loaf, one thick loaf with olive oil mixed in, and one thin loaf, and he put these on the fat portions and on the right thigh. </span>
<span class='v LV8_27' data-id='LV8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they waved them before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as a wave offering. </span>
<span class='v LV8_28' data-id='LV8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, a food offering presented to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV8_29' data-id='LV8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Moses also took the breast, which was his share of the ordination ram, and waved it before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as a wave offering, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_30' data-id='LV8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. So he consecrated Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_31' data-id='LV8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons are to eat it.’ </span>
<span class='v LV8_32' data-id='LV8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then burn up the rest of the meat and the bread. </span>
<span class='v LV8_33' data-id='LV8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the days of your ordination are completed, for your ordination will last seven days. </span>
<span class='v LV8_34' data-id='LV8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>What has been done today was commanded by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to make atonement for you. </span>
<span class='v LV8_35' data-id='LV8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>You must stay at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and do what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> requires, so you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV8_36' data-id='LV8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>So Aaron and his sons did everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded through Moses. </span></div></div>
