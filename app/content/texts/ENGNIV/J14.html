<span class='v J14_1' data-id='J14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_2' data-id='J14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, </span>
<span class='v J14_3' data-id='J14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. </span></div>

<span class='v J14_8' data-id='J14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. </span>
<span class='v J14_9' data-id='J14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. </span>
<span class='v J14_10' data-id='J14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. </span>
<span class='v J14_11' data-id='J14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. </span>
<span class='v J14_12' data-id='J14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us. </span></div>

<span class='v J14_13' data-id='J14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is how we know that we live in him and he in us: He has given us of his Spirit. </span>

<span class='v J14_21' data-id='J14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he has given us this command: Anyone who loves God must also love their brother and sister. </span></div></div>
