<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_1' data-id='S219_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Joab was told, “The king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” </span>
<span class='v S219_2' data-id='S219_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning, because on that day the troops heard it said, “The king is grieving for his son.” </span>
<span class='v S219_3' data-id='S219_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle. </span>
<span class='v S219_4' data-id='S219_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king covered his face and cried aloud, “O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_5' data-id='S219_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have humiliated all your men, who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines. </span>
<span class='v S219_6' data-id='S219_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you. I see that you would be pleased if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. </span>
<span class='v S219_7' data-id='S219_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now go out and encourage your men. I swear by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that if you don’t go out, not a man will be left with you by nightfall. This will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come on you from your youth till now.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_8' data-id='S219_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the men were told, “The king is sitting in the gateway,” they all came before him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_8' data-id='S219_8'>Meanwhile, the Israelites had fled to their homes. </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Returns to Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_9' data-id='S219_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Throughout the tribes of Israel, all the people were arguing among themselves, saying, “The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies; he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the Philistines. But now he has fled the country to escape from Absalom; </span>
<span class='v S219_10' data-id='S219_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_11' data-id='S219_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests: “Ask the elders of Judah, ‘Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace, since what is being said throughout Israel has reached the king at his quarters? </span>
<span class='v S219_12' data-id='S219_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood. So why should you be the last to bring back the king?’ </span>
<span class='v S219_13' data-id='S219_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And say to Amasa, ‘Are you not my own flesh and blood? May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if you are not the commander of my army for life in place of Joab.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_14' data-id='S219_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He won over the hearts of the men of Judah so that they were all of one mind. They sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your men.” </span>
<span class='v S219_15' data-id='S219_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the king returned and went as far as the Jordan. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_15' data-id='S219_15'>Now the men of Judah had come to Gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v S219_16' data-id='S219_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. </span>
<span class='v S219_17' data-id='S219_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>With him were a thousand Benjamites, along with Ziba, the steward of Saul’s household, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed to the Jordan, where the king was. </span>
<span class='v S219_18' data-id='S219_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They crossed at the ford to take the king’s household over and to do whatever he wished. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_18' data-id='S219_18'>When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell prostrate before the king </span>
<span class='v S219_19' data-id='S219_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “May my lord not hold me guilty. Do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind. </span>
<span class='v S219_20' data-id='S219_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I your servant know that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first from the tribes of Joseph to come down and meet my lord the king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_21' data-id='S219_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this? He cursed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_22' data-id='S219_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>David replied, “What does this have to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? What right do you have to interfere? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? Don’t I know that today I am king over Israel?” </span>
<span class='v S219_23' data-id='S219_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king promised him on oath. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_24' data-id='S219_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet the king. He had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. </span>
<span class='v S219_25' data-id='S219_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Why didn’t you go with me, Mephibosheth?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_26' data-id='S219_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He said, “My lord the king, since I your servant am lame, I said, ‘I will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it, so I can go with the king.’ But Ziba my servant betrayed me. </span>
<span class='v S219_27' data-id='S219_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king. My lord the king is like an angel of God; so do whatever you wish. </span>
<span class='v S219_28' data-id='S219_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>All my grandfather’s descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king, but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table. So what right do I have to make any more appeals to the king?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_29' data-id='S219_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The king said to him, “Why say more? I order you and Ziba to divide the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_30' data-id='S219_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him take everything, now that my lord the king has returned home safely.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_31' data-id='S219_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Barzillai the Gileadite also came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there. </span>
<span class='v S219_32' data-id='S219_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now Barzillai was very old, eighty years of age. He had provided for the king during his stay in Mahanaim, for he was a very wealthy man. </span>
<span class='v S219_33' data-id='S219_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and stay with me in Jerusalem, and I will provide for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_34' data-id='S219_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But Barzillai answered the king, “How many more years will I live, that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? </span>
<span class='v S219_35' data-id='S219_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>I am now eighty years old. Can I tell the difference between what is enjoyable and what is not? Can your servant taste what he eats and drinks? Can I still hear the voices of male and female singers? Why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? </span>
<span class='v S219_36' data-id='S219_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Your servant will cross over the Jordan with the king for a short distance, but why should the king reward me in this way? </span>
<span class='v S219_37' data-id='S219_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Let your servant return, that I may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Kimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king. Do for him whatever you wish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_38' data-id='S219_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The king said, “Kimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him whatever you wish. And anything you desire from me I will do for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_39' data-id='S219_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed over. The king kissed Barzillai and bid him farewell, and Barzillai returned to his home. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_40' data-id='S219_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham crossed with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel had taken the king over. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_41' data-id='S219_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Soon all the men of Israel were coming to the king and saying to him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal the king away and bring him and his household across the Jordan, together with all his men?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_42' data-id='S219_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “We did this because the king is closely related to us. Why are you angry about it? Have we eaten any of the king’s provisions? Have we taken anything for ourselves?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_43' data-id='S219_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten shares in the king; so we have a greater claim on David than you have. Why then do you treat us with contempt? Weren’t we the first to speak of bringing back our king?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S219_43' data-id='S219_43'>But the men of Judah pressed their claims even more forcefully than the men of Israel. </span></div></div>
