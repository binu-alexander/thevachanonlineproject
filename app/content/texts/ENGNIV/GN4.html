<span class='v GN4_2' data-id='GN4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_2' data-id='GN4_2'>Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil. </span>
<span class='v GN4_3' data-id='GN4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In the course of time Cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v GN4_4' data-id='GN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> looked with favor on Abel and his offering, </span>
<span class='v GN4_5' data-id='GN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but on Cain and his offering he did not look with favor. So Cain was very angry, and his face was downcast. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_6' data-id='GN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast? </span>
<span class='v GN4_7' data-id='GN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_8' data-id='GN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”<span class='note' id='footnote-17'><a href='#note-17' class='key'>§</a></span> While they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_9' data-id='GN4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” </span></div>

<span class='v GN4_9' data-id='GN4_9'>“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s keeper?” </span></div>

<span class='v GN4_10' data-id='GN4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground. </span>
<span class='v GN4_11' data-id='GN4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now you are under a curse and driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. </span>
<span class='v GN4_12' data-id='GN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its crops for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_13' data-id='GN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Cain said to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “My punishment is more than I can bear. </span>
<span class='v GN4_14' data-id='GN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN4_15' data-id='GN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Not so<span class='note' id='footnote-18'><a href='#note-18' class='key'>*</a></span>; anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him. </span>
<span class='v GN4_16' data-id='GN4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So Cain went out from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s presence and lived in the land of Nod,<span class='note' id='footnote-19'><a href='#note-19' class='key'>†</a></span> east of Eden. </span></div>
