There at the entrance of the gate were twenty-five men, and I saw among them Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people. </span>
<span class='v EK11_2' data-id='EK11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city. </span>
<span class='v EK11_3' data-id='EK11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They say, ‘Haven’t our houses been recently rebuilt? This city is a pot, and we are the meat in it.’ </span>

<span class='v EK11_5' data-id='EK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came on me, and he told me to say: “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: That is what you are saying, you leaders in Israel, but I know what is going through your mind. </span>
<span class='v EK11_6' data-id='EK11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead. </span></div>
