<div class='s'>Ezekiel’s Inaugural Vision </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_1' data-id='EK1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In my thirtieth year, in the fourth month on the fifth day, while I was among the exiles by the Kebar River, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_2' data-id='EK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>On the fifth of the month—it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiachin— </span>
<span class='v EK1_3' data-id='EK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, by the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians.<span class='note' id='footnote-2049'><a href='#note-2049' class='key'>*</a></span> There the hand of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was on him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_4' data-id='EK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I looked, and I saw a windstorm coming out of the north—an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal, </span>
<span class='v EK1_5' data-id='EK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, </span>
<span class='v EK1_6' data-id='EK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but each of them had four faces and four wings. </span>
<span class='v EK1_7' data-id='EK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Their legs were straight; their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze. </span>
<span class='v EK1_8' data-id='EK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. All four of them had faces and wings, </span>
<span class='v EK1_9' data-id='EK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and the wings of one touched the wings of another. Each one went straight ahead; they did not turn as they moved. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_10' data-id='EK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle. </span>
<span class='v EK1_11' data-id='EK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Such were their faces. They each had two wings spreading out upward, each wing touching that of the creature on either side; and each had two other wings covering its body. </span>
<span class='v EK1_12' data-id='EK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Each one went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went. </span>
<span class='v EK1_13' data-id='EK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire moved back and forth among the creatures; it was bright, and lightning flashed out of it. </span>
<span class='v EK1_14' data-id='EK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_15' data-id='EK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. </span>
<span class='v EK1_16' data-id='EK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. </span>
<span class='v EK1_17' data-id='EK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. </span>
<span class='v EK1_18' data-id='EK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_19' data-id='EK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. </span>
<span class='v EK1_20' data-id='EK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. </span>
<span class='v EK1_21' data-id='EK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_22' data-id='EK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked something like a vault, sparkling like crystal, and awesome. </span>
<span class='v EK1_23' data-id='EK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Under the vault their wings were stretched out one toward the other, and each had two wings covering its body. </span>
<span class='v EK1_24' data-id='EK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty,<span class='note' id='footnote-2050'><a href='#note-2050' class='key'>†</a></span> like the tumult of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_25' data-id='EK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then there came a voice from above the vault over their heads as they stood with lowered wings. </span>
<span class='v EK1_26' data-id='EK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Above the vault over their heads was what looked like a throne of lapis lazuli, and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man. </span>
<span class='v EK1_27' data-id='EK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and that from there down he looked like fire; and brilliant light surrounded him. </span>
<span class='v EK1_28' data-id='EK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK1_28' data-id='EK1_28'>This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking. </span></div></div>
