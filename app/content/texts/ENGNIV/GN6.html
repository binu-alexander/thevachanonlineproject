<div class='s'>Wickedness in the World </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_1' data-id='GN6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them, </span>
<span class='v GN6_2' data-id='GN6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful, and they married any of them they chose. </span>
<span class='v GN6_3' data-id='GN6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “My Spirit will not contend with<span class='note' id='footnote-26'><a href='#note-26' class='key'>*</a></span> humans forever, for they are mortal<span class='note' id='footnote-27'><a href='#note-27' class='key'>†</a></span>; their days will be a hundred and twenty years.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_4' data-id='GN6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. They were the heroes of old, men of renown. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_5' data-id='GN6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time. </span>
<span class='v GN6_6' data-id='GN6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was deeply troubled. </span>
<span class='v GN6_7' data-id='GN6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “I will wipe from the face of the earth the human race I have created—and with them the animals, the birds and the creatures that move along the ground—for I regret that I have made them.” </span>
<span class='v GN6_8' data-id='GN6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Noah and the Flood </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_9' data-id='GN6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This is the account of Noah and his family. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_9' data-id='GN6_9'>Noah was a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time, and he walked faithfully with God. </span>
<span class='v GN6_10' data-id='GN6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_11' data-id='GN6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of violence. </span>
<span class='v GN6_12' data-id='GN6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways. </span>
<span class='v GN6_13' data-id='GN6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So God said to Noah, “I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them. I am surely going to destroy both them and the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_14' data-id='GN6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So make yourself an ark of cypress<span class='note' id='footnote-28'><a href='#note-28' class='key'>‡</a></span> wood; make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out. </span>
<span class='v GN6_15' data-id='GN6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This is how you are to build it: The ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high.<span class='note' id='footnote-29'><a href='#note-29' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v GN6_16' data-id='GN6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Make a roof for it, leaving below the roof an opening one cubit<span class='note' id='footnote-30'><a href='#note-30' class='key'>*</a></span> high all around.<span class='note' id='footnote-31'><a href='#note-31' class='key'>†</a></span> Put a door in the side of the ark and make lower, middle and upper decks. </span>
<span class='v GN6_17' data-id='GN6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens, every creature that has the breath of life in it. Everything on earth will perish. </span>
<span class='v GN6_18' data-id='GN6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But I will establish my covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you. </span>
<span class='v GN6_19' data-id='GN6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. </span>

<span class='v GN6_21' data-id='GN6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them.” </span></div>
