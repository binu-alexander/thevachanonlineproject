<div class='s'>The Way of the Cross </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_1' data-id='MK9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see that the kingdom of God has come with power.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Transfiguration </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_2' data-id='MK9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone. There he was transfigured before them. </span>
<span class='v MK9_3' data-id='MK9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them. </span>
<span class='v MK9_4' data-id='MK9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_5' data-id='MK9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” </span>
<span class='v MK9_6' data-id='MK9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_7' data-id='MK9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_8' data-id='MK9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_9' data-id='MK9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. </span>
<span class='v MK9_10' data-id='MK9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They kept the matter to themselves, discussing what “rising from the dead” meant. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_11' data-id='MK9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_12' data-id='MK9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“To be sure, Elijah does come first, and restores all things. Why then is it written that the Son of Man must suffer much and be rejected?</span></span>
<span class='v MK9_13' data-id='MK9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But I tell you, Elijah has come, and they have done to him everything they wished, just as it is written about him.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Boy Possessed by an Impure Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_14' data-id='MK9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When they came to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. </span>
<span class='v MK9_15' data-id='MK9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As soon as all the people saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_16' data-id='MK9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What are you arguing with them about?”</span> he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_17' data-id='MK9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>A man in the crowd answered, “Teacher, I brought you my son, who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech. </span>
<span class='v MK9_18' data-id='MK9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Whenever it seizes him, it throws him to the ground. He foams at the mouth, gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive out the spirit, but they could not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_19' data-id='MK9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You unbelieving generation,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_20' data-id='MK9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So they brought him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_21' data-id='MK9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus asked the boy’s father, <span class='wj'>“How long has he been like this?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_21' data-id='MK9_21'>“From childhood,” he answered. </span>
<span class='v MK9_22' data-id='MK9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“It has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him. But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_23' data-id='MK9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘If you can’?”</span> said Jesus. <span class='wj'>“Everything is possible for one who believes.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_24' data-id='MK9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Immediately the boy’s father exclaimed, “I do believe; help me overcome my unbelief!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_25' data-id='MK9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the impure spirit. <span class='wj'>“You deaf and mute spirit,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“I command you, come out of him and never enter him again.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_26' data-id='MK9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The spirit shrieked, convulsed him violently and came out. The boy looked so much like a corpse that many said, “He’s dead.” </span>
<span class='v MK9_27' data-id='MK9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet, and he stood up. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_28' data-id='MK9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_29' data-id='MK9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“This kind can come out only by prayer.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2579'><a href='#note-2579' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_30' data-id='MK9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus did not want anyone to know where they were, </span>
<span class='v MK9_31' data-id='MK9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>because he was teaching his disciples. He said to them, <span class='wj'>“The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK9_32' data-id='MK9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_33' data-id='MK9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, <span class='wj'>“What were you arguing about on the road?”</span></span>
<span class='v MK9_34' data-id='MK9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_35' data-id='MK9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Sitting down, Jesus called the Twelve and said, <span class='wj'>“Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last, and the servant of all.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_36' data-id='MK9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He took a little child whom he placed among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them, </span>
<span class='v MK9_37' data-id='MK9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_38' data-id='MK9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop, because he was not one of us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK9_39' data-id='MK9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Do not stop him,”</span> Jesus said. <span class='wj'>“For no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me, </span></span>
<span class='v MK9_40' data-id='MK9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>for whoever is not against us is for us.</span></span>
