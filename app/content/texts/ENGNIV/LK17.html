<span class='v LK17_5' data-id='LK17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” </span></div>

<span class='v LK17_14' data-id='LK17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he saw them, he said, <span class='wj'>“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</span> And as they went, they were cleansed. </span></div>
