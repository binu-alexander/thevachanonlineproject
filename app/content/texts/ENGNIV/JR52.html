<div class='s'>The Fall of Jerusalem </div>

<span class='v JR52_1' data-id='JR52_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_2' data-id='JR52_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, just as Jehoiakim had done. </span>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It was because of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger that all this happened to Jerusalem and Judah, and in the end he thrust them from his presence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'>Now Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_4' data-id='JR52_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So in the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it. </span>
<span class='v JR52_5' data-id='JR52_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_6' data-id='JR52_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat. </span>
<span class='v JR52_7' data-id='JR52_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army fled. They left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Babylonians<span class='note' id='footnote-2037'><a href='#note-2037' class='key'>*</a></span> were surrounding the city. They fled toward the Arabah,<span class='note' id='footnote-2038'><a href='#note-2038' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v JR52_8' data-id='JR52_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but the Babylonian<span class='note' id='footnote-2039'><a href='#note-2039' class='key'>‡</a></span> army pursued King Zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of Jericho. All his soldiers were separated from him and scattered, </span>
<span class='v JR52_9' data-id='JR52_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and he was captured. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_9' data-id='JR52_9'>He was taken to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced sentence on him. </span>
<span class='v JR52_10' data-id='JR52_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>There at Riblah the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he also killed all the officials of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_11' data-id='JR52_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles and took him to Babylon, where he put him in prison till the day of his death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_12' data-id='JR52_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. </span>

<span class='v JR52_16' data-id='JR52_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields. </span></div>
