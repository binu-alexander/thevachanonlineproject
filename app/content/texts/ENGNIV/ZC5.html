<div class='s'>The Flying Scroll </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_1' data-id='ZC5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I looked again, and there before me was a flying scroll. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_2' data-id='ZC5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He asked me, “What do you see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_2' data-id='ZC5_2'>I answered, “I see a flying scroll, twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide.<span class='note' id='footnote-2407'><a href='#note-2407' class='key'>*</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_3' data-id='ZC5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the whole land; for according to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished, and according to what it says on the other, everyone who swears falsely will be banished. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_4' data-id='ZC5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty declares, ‘I will send it out, and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it completely, both its timbers and its stones.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Woman in a Basket </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_5' data-id='ZC5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is appearing.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC5_6' data-id='ZC5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I asked, “What is it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_6' data-id='ZC5_6'>He replied, “It is a basket.” And he added, “This is the iniquity<span class='note' id='footnote-2408'><a href='#note-2408' class='key'>†</a></span> of the people throughout the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_7' data-id='ZC5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the cover of lead was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! </span>
<span class='v ZC5_8' data-id='ZC5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said, “This is wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed its lead cover down on it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_9' data-id='ZC5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then I looked up—and there before me were two women, with the wind in their wings! They had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC5_10' data-id='ZC5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Where are they taking the basket?” I asked the angel who was speaking to me. </span></div>
