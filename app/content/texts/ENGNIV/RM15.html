<span class='v RM15_1' data-id='RM15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. </span>
<span class='v RM15_2' data-id='RM15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Each of us should please our neighbors for their good, to build them up. </span>
<span class='v RM15_3' data-id='RM15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For even Christ did not please himself but, as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2944'><a href='#note-2944' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM15_4' data-id='RM15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope. </span></div>

<span class='v RM15_5' data-id='RM15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, </span>

<span class='v RM15_7' data-id='RM15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring praise to God. </span>
<span class='v RM15_8' data-id='RM15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the Jews<span class='note' id='footnote-2945'><a href='#note-2945' class='key'>†</a></span> on behalf of God’s truth, so that the promises made to the patriarchs might be confirmed </span>
<span class='v RM15_9' data-id='RM15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and, moreover, that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written: </span></div>

<div class='s'>Paul the Minister to the Gentiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_14' data-id='RM15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with knowledge and competent to instruct one another. </span>
<span class='v RM15_15' data-id='RM15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet I have written you quite boldly on some points to remind you of them again, because of the grace God gave me </span>
<span class='v RM15_16' data-id='RM15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. He gave me the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_17' data-id='RM15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore I glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God. </span>
<span class='v RM15_18' data-id='RM15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by what I have said and done— </span>
<span class='v RM15_19' data-id='RM15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>by the power of signs and wonders, through the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ. </span>
<span class='v RM15_20' data-id='RM15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>It has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation. </span>
<span class='v RM15_21' data-id='RM15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Rather, as it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_21' data-id='RM15_21'>“Those who were not told about him will see, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM15_22' data-id='RM15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>This is why I have often been hindered from coming to you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul’s Plan to Visit Rome </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_23' data-id='RM15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions, and since I have been longing for many years to visit you, </span>
<span class='v RM15_24' data-id='RM15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. </span>
<span class='v RM15_25' data-id='RM15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem in the service of the Lord’s people there. </span>
<span class='v RM15_26' data-id='RM15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the Lord’s people in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v RM15_27' data-id='RM15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings. </span>
<span class='v RM15_28' data-id='RM15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So after I have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this contribution, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way. </span>
<span class='v RM15_29' data-id='RM15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I know that when I come to you, I will come in the full measure of the blessing of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_30' data-id='RM15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me. </span>
<span class='v RM15_31' data-id='RM15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea and that the contribution I take to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the Lord’s people there, </span>
<span class='v RM15_32' data-id='RM15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>so that I may come to you with joy, by God’s will, and in your company be refreshed. </span>
<span class='v RM15_33' data-id='RM15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The God of peace be with you all. Amen. </span></div></div>
