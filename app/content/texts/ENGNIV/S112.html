<div class='s'>Samuel’s Farewell Speech </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_1' data-id='S112_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to all Israel, “I have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you. </span>
<span class='v S112_2' data-id='S112_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now you have a king as your leader. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader from my youth until this day. </span>
<span class='v S112_3' data-id='S112_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Here I stand. Testify against me in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I cheated? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes? If I have done any of these things, I will make it right.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_4' data-id='S112_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“You have not cheated or oppressed us,” they replied. “You have not taken anything from anyone’s hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_5' data-id='S112_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to them, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is witness against you, and also his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_5' data-id='S112_5'>“He is witness,” they said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_6' data-id='S112_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your ancestors up out of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v S112_7' data-id='S112_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now then, stand here, because I am going to confront you with evidence before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as to all the righteous acts performed by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for you and your ancestors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_8' data-id='S112_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“After Jacob entered Egypt, they cried to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for help, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_9' data-id='S112_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“But they forgot the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God; so he sold them into the hand of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hands of the Philistines and the king of Moab, who fought against them. </span>
<span class='v S112_10' data-id='S112_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, ‘We have sinned; we have forsaken the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths. But now deliver us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve you.’ </span>
<span class='v S112_11' data-id='S112_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent Jerub-Baal,<span class='note' id='footnote-701'><a href='#note-701' class='key'>*</a></span> Barak,<span class='note' id='footnote-702'><a href='#note-702' class='key'>†</a></span> Jephthah and Samuel,<span class='note' id='footnote-703'><a href='#note-703' class='key'>‡</a></span> and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies all around you, so that you lived in safety. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_12' data-id='S112_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was moving against you, you said to me, ‘No, we want a king to rule over us’—even though the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God was your king. </span>
<span class='v S112_13' data-id='S112_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now here is the king you have chosen, the one you asked for; see, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has set a king over you. </span>
<span class='v S112_14' data-id='S112_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If you fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God—good! </span>
<span class='v S112_15' data-id='S112_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if you do not obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and if you rebel against his commands, his hand will be against you, as it was against your ancestors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_16' data-id='S112_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Now then, stand still and see this great thing the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is about to do before your eyes! </span>
<span class='v S112_17' data-id='S112_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Is it not wheat harvest now? I will call on the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to send thunder and rain. And you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> when you asked for a king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_18' data-id='S112_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel called on the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and that same day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent thunder and rain. So all the people stood in awe of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and of Samuel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_19' data-id='S112_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The people all said to Samuel, “Pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God for your servants so that we will not die, for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_20' data-id='S112_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “You have done all this evil; yet do not turn away from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with all your heart. </span>
<span class='v S112_21' data-id='S112_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not turn away after useless idols. They can do you no good, nor can they rescue you, because they are useless. </span>
<span class='v S112_22' data-id='S112_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For the sake of his great name the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will not reject his people, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was pleased to make you his own. </span>
<span class='v S112_23' data-id='S112_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> by failing to pray for you. And I will teach you the way that is good and right. </span>
<span class='v S112_24' data-id='S112_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But be sure to fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and serve him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things he has done for you. </span>
<span class='v S112_25' data-id='S112_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Yet if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will perish.” </span></div></div>
