<div class='s'>The Council at Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_1' data-id='AC15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Certain people came down from Judea to Antioch and were teaching the believers: “Unless you are circumcised, according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.” </span>
<span class='v AC15_2' data-id='AC15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This brought Paul and Barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them. So Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with some other believers, to go up to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question. </span>
<span class='v AC15_3' data-id='AC15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The church sent them on their way, and as they traveled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told how the Gentiles had been converted. This news made all the believers very glad. </span>
<span class='v AC15_4' data-id='AC15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders, to whom they reported everything God had done through them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_5' data-id='AC15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_6' data-id='AC15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The apostles and elders met to consider this question. </span>
<span class='v AC15_7' data-id='AC15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After much discussion, Peter got up and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. </span>
<span class='v AC15_8' data-id='AC15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us. </span>
<span class='v AC15_9' data-id='AC15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He did not discriminate between us and them, for he purified their hearts by faith. </span>
<span class='v AC15_10' data-id='AC15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now then, why do you try to test God by putting on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors have been able to bear? </span>
<span class='v AC15_11' data-id='AC15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No! We believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_12' data-id='AC15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul telling about the signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. </span>
<span class='v AC15_13' data-id='AC15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When they finished, James spoke up. “Brothers,” he said, “listen to me. </span>
<span class='v AC15_14' data-id='AC15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Simon<span class='note' id='footnote-2827'><a href='#note-2827' class='key'>*</a></span> has described to us how God first intervened to choose a people for his name from the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v AC15_15' data-id='AC15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“ ‘After this I will return </span></div>

<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>and I will restore it, </span></div>

<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, </span></div>

<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'>even all the Gentiles who bear my name, </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC15_18' data-id='AC15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>things known from long ago.<span class='note' id='footnote-2829'><a href='#note-2829' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_19' data-id='AC15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“It is my judgment, therefore, that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God. </span>
<span class='v AC15_20' data-id='AC15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood. </span>
<span class='v AC15_21' data-id='AC15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Council’s Letter to Gentile Believers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_22' data-id='AC15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers. </span>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>With them they sent the following letter: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'>The apostles and elders, your brothers, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'>To the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'>Greetings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_24' data-id='AC15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>We have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you, troubling your minds by what they said. </span>
<span class='v AC15_25' data-id='AC15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— </span>
<span class='v AC15_26' data-id='AC15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC15_27' data-id='AC15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing. </span>
<span class='v AC15_28' data-id='AC15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements: </span>
<span class='v AC15_29' data-id='AC15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality. You will do well to avoid these things. </span></div>
<div class='pc'>
<span class='v AC15_29' data-id='AC15_29'>Farewell. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_30' data-id='AC15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter. </span>
<span class='v AC15_31' data-id='AC15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The people read it and were glad for its encouraging message. </span>
<span class='v AC15_32' data-id='AC15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Judas and Silas, who themselves were prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers. </span>
<span class='v AC15_33' data-id='AC15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.<span class='note' id='footnote-2830'><a href='#note-2830' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v AC15_35' data-id='AC15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_36' data-id='AC15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Some time later Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.” </span>
<span class='v AC15_37' data-id='AC15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them, </span>
<span class='v AC15_38' data-id='AC15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>but Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work. </span>
<span class='v AC15_39' data-id='AC15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus, </span>
<span class='v AC15_40' data-id='AC15_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>but Paul chose Silas and left, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC15_41' data-id='AC15_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. </span></div></div>
