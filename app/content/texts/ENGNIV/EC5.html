<div class='s'>Fulfill Your Vow to God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_1' data-id='EC5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they do wrong. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Do not be quick with your mouth, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'>do not be hasty in your heart </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'>to utter anything before God. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'>God is in heaven </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'>and you are on earth, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_2' data-id='EC5_2'>so let your words be few. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_3' data-id='EC5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>A dream comes when there are many cares, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_3' data-id='EC5_3'>and many words mark the speech of a fool. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_4' data-id='EC5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When you make a vow to God, do not delay to fulfill it. He has no pleasure in fools; fulfill your vow. </span>
<span class='v EC5_5' data-id='EC5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is better not to make a vow than to make one and not fulfill it. </span>
<span class='v EC5_6' data-id='EC5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not let your mouth lead you into sin. And do not protest to the temple messenger, “My vow was a mistake.” Why should God be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands? </span>
<span class='v EC5_7' data-id='EC5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Much dreaming and many words are meaningless. Therefore fear God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Riches Are Meaningless </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_8' data-id='EC5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you see the poor oppressed in a district, and justice and rights denied, do not be surprised at such things; for one official is eyed by a higher one, and over them both are others higher still. </span>
<span class='v EC5_9' data-id='EC5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The increase from the land is taken by all; the king himself profits from the fields. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_10' data-id='EC5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whoever loves money never has enough; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_10' data-id='EC5_10'>whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_10' data-id='EC5_10'>This too is meaningless. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_11' data-id='EC5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As goods increase, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_11' data-id='EC5_11'>so do those who consume them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_11' data-id='EC5_11'>And what benefit are they to the owners </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_11' data-id='EC5_11'>except to feast their eyes on them? </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_12' data-id='EC5_12'>but as for the rich, their abundance </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_12' data-id='EC5_12'>permits them no sleep. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_13' data-id='EC5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I have seen a grievous evil under the sun: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_13' data-id='EC5_13'>wealth hoarded to the harm of its owners, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_14' data-id='EC5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>or wealth lost through some misfortune, </span></div>

<span class='v EC5_14' data-id='EC5_14'>so that when they have children </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_14' data-id='EC5_14'>there is nothing left for them to inherit. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_15' data-id='EC5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Everyone comes naked from their mother’s womb, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_15' data-id='EC5_15'>and as everyone comes, so they depart. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_15' data-id='EC5_15'>They take nothing from their toil </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_15' data-id='EC5_15'>that they can carry in their hands. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_16' data-id='EC5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This too is a grievous evil: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_16' data-id='EC5_16'>As everyone comes, so they depart, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_16' data-id='EC5_16'>and what do they gain, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_16' data-id='EC5_16'>since they toil for the wind? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC5_17' data-id='EC5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>All their days they eat in darkness, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC5_17' data-id='EC5_17'>with great frustration, affliction and anger. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC5_18' data-id='EC5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>This is what I have observed to be good: that it is appropriate for a person to eat, to drink and to find satisfaction in their toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their lot. </span>
<span class='v EC5_19' data-id='EC5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and be happy in their toil—this is a gift of God. </span>
<span class='v EC5_20' data-id='EC5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with gladness of heart. </span></div></div>
