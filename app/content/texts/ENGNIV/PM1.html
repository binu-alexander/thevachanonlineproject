<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'>To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker— </span>
<span class='v PM1_2' data-id='PM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_3' data-id='PM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace and peace to you<span class='note' id='footnote-3142'><a href='#note-3142' class='key'>*</a></span> from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Thanksgiving and Prayer </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_4' data-id='PM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, </span>
<span class='v PM1_5' data-id='PM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because I hear about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PM1_6' data-id='PM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I pray that your partnership with us in the faith may be effective in deepening your understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_7' data-id='PM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord’s people. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul’s Plea for Onesimus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_8' data-id='PM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore, although in Christ I could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, </span>
<span class='v PM1_9' data-id='PM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>yet I prefer to appeal to you on the basis of love. It is as none other than Paul—an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus— </span>
<span class='v PM1_10' data-id='PM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,<span class='note' id='footnote-3143'><a href='#note-3143' class='key'>†</a></span> who became my son while I was in chains. </span>
<span class='v PM1_11' data-id='PM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_12' data-id='PM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I am sending him—who is my very heart—back to you. </span>
<span class='v PM1_13' data-id='PM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PM1_14' data-id='PM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that any favor you do would not seem forced but would be voluntary. </span>
<span class='v PM1_15' data-id='PM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever— </span>
<span class='v PM1_16' data-id='PM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even dearer to you, both as a fellow man and as a brother in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_17' data-id='PM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_18' data-id='PM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_19' data-id='PM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your very self. </span>
<span class='v PM1_20' data-id='PM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I do wish, brother, that I may have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_21' data-id='PM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_22' data-id='PM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And one thing more: Prepare a guest room for me, because I hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_23' data-id='PM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings. </span>
<span class='v PM1_24' data-id='PM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_25' data-id='PM1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span></div></div>
