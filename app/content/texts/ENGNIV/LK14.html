<div class='s'>Jesus at a Pharisee’s House </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_1' data-id='LK14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One Sabbath, when Jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent Pharisee, he was being carefully watched. </span>
<span class='v LK14_2' data-id='LK14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There in front of him was a man suffering from abnormal swelling of his body. </span>
<span class='v LK14_3' data-id='LK14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, <span class='wj'>“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_4' data-id='LK14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But they remained silent. So taking hold of the man, he healed him and sent him on his way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_5' data-id='LK14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then he asked them, <span class='wj'>“If one of you has a child</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2672'><a href='#note-2672' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?”</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_6' data-id='LK14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they had nothing to say. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_7' data-id='LK14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told them this parable: </span>
<span class='v LK14_8' data-id='LK14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_9' data-id='LK14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this person your seat.’ Then, humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_10' data-id='LK14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But when you are invited, take the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_11' data-id='LK14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_12' data-id='LK14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to his host, <span class='wj'>“When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_13' data-id='LK14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, </span></span>
<span class='v LK14_14' data-id='LK14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Great Banquet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_15' data-id='LK14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_16' data-id='LK14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied: <span class='wj'>“A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_17' data-id='LK14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_18' data-id='LK14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_19' data-id='LK14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_20' data-id='LK14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’ </span></span></div>

<span class='v LK14_21' data-id='LK14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_22' data-id='LK14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_23' data-id='LK14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_24' data-id='LK14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.’ ”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Cost of Being a Disciple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_25' data-id='LK14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and turning to them he said: </span>
<span class='v LK14_26' data-id='LK14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_27' data-id='LK14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_28' data-id='LK14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_29' data-id='LK14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, </span></span>
<span class='v LK14_30' data-id='LK14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_31' data-id='LK14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king.

<span class='v LK14_32' data-id='LK14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.</span></span>
<span class='v LK14_33' data-id='LK14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.</span></span></div>
