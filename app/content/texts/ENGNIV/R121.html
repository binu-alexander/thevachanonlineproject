<div class='s'>David Counts the Fighting Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_1' data-id='R121_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R121_2' data-id='R121_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then report back to me so that I may know how many there are.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_3' data-id='R121_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Joab replied, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> multiply his troops a hundred times over. My lord the king, are they not all my lord’s subjects? Why does my lord want to do this? Why should he bring guilt on Israel?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_4' data-id='R121_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king’s word, however, overruled Joab; so Joab left and went throughout Israel and then came back to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R121_5' data-id='R121_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to David: In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword, including four hundred and seventy thousand in Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_6' data-id='R121_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Joab did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, because the king’s command was repulsive to him. </span>
<span class='v R121_7' data-id='R121_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This command was also evil in the sight of God; so he punished Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_8' data-id='R121_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by doing this. Now, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_9' data-id='R121_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Gad, David’s seer, </span>
<span class='v R121_10' data-id='R121_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_11' data-id='R121_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘Take your choice: </span>
<span class='v R121_12' data-id='R121_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>three years of famine, three months of being swept away<span class='note' id='footnote-1097'><a href='#note-1097' class='key'>*</a></span> before your enemies, with their swords overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>—days of plague in the land, with the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> ravaging every part of Israel.’ Now then, decide how I should answer the one who sent me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_13' data-id='R121_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let me fall into the hands of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for his mercy is very great; but do not let me fall into human hands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_14' data-id='R121_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent a plague on Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell dead. </span>
<span class='v R121_15' data-id='R121_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But as the angel was doing so, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> saw it and relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was destroying the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was then standing at the threshing floor of Araunah<span class='note' id='footnote-1098'><a href='#note-1098' class='key'>†</a></span> the Jebusite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_16' data-id='R121_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>David looked up and saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand extended over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell facedown. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_17' data-id='R121_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>David said to God, “Was it not I who ordered the fighting men to be counted? I, the shepherd,<span class='note' id='footnote-1099'><a href='#note-1099' class='key'>‡</a></span> have sinned and done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God, let your hand fall on me and my family, but do not let this plague remain on your people.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Builds an Altar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_18' data-id='R121_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> ordered Gad to tell David to go up and build an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. </span>
<span class='v R121_19' data-id='R121_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So David went up in obedience to the word that Gad had spoken in the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_20' data-id='R121_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>While Araunah was threshing wheat, he turned and saw the angel; his four sons who were with him hid themselves. </span>
<span class='v R121_21' data-id='R121_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then David approached, and when Araunah looked and saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed down before David with his face to the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_22' data-id='R121_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>David said to him, “Let me have the site of your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, that the plague on the people may be stopped. Sell it to me at the full price.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_23' data-id='R121_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Araunah said to David, “Take it! Let my lord the king do whatever pleases him. Look, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, the threshing sledges for the wood, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give all this.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_24' data-id='R121_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But King David replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying the full price. I will not take for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> what is yours, or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_25' data-id='R121_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So David paid Araunah six hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-1100'><a href='#note-1100' class='key'>§</a></span> of gold for the site. </span>
<span class='v R121_26' data-id='R121_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>David built an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He called on the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_27' data-id='R121_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoke to the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. </span>
<span class='v R121_28' data-id='R121_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>At that time, when David saw that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had answered him on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite, he offered sacrifices there. </span>
<span class='v R121_29' data-id='R121_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon. </span>
<span class='v R121_30' data-id='R121_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div></div>
