<span class='v EK20_1' data-id='EK20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and they sat down in front of me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK20_2' data-id='EK20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK20_3' data-id='EK20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Have you come to inquire of me? As surely as I live, I will not let you inquire of me, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ </span></div>

<span class='v EK20_5' data-id='EK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt. With uplifted hand I said to them, “I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God.” </span>
<span class='v EK20_6' data-id='EK20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands. </span>
<span class='v EK20_7' data-id='EK20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I said to them, “Each of you, get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God.” </span></div>

<span class='v EK20_8' data-id='EK20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“ ‘But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I said I would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EK20_9' data-id='EK20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But for the sake of my name, I brought them out of Egypt. I did it to keep my name from being profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites. </span>

<span class='v EK20_12' data-id='EK20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> made them holy. </span></div>

<span class='v EK20_16' data-id='EK20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths. For their hearts were devoted to their idols. </span>
<span class='v EK20_17' data-id='EK20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v EK20_18' data-id='EK20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols. </span>

<span class='v EK20_22' data-id='EK20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But I withheld my hand, and for the sake of my name I did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. </span>
<span class='v EK20_23' data-id='EK20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Also with uplifted hand I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries, </span>
<span class='v EK20_24' data-id='EK20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols. </span>
<span class='v EK20_25' data-id='EK20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So I gave them other statutes that were not good and laws through which they could not live; </span>
<span class='v EK20_26' data-id='EK20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK20_27' data-id='EK20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, son of man, speak to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me: </span>
