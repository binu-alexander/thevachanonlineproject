<div class='s'>God’s Marvelous Plan for the Gentiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_1' data-id='EP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles— </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_2' data-id='EP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Surely you have heard about the administration of God’s grace that was given to me for you, </span>
<span class='v EP3_3' data-id='EP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. </span>
<span class='v EP3_4' data-id='EP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_5' data-id='EP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. </span>
<span class='v EP3_6' data-id='EP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_7' data-id='EP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given me through the working of his power. </span>
<span class='v EP3_8' data-id='EP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Although I am less than the least of all the Lord’s people, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the boundless riches of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_9' data-id='EP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things. </span>
<span class='v EP3_10' data-id='EP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>His intent was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms, </span>
<span class='v EP3_11' data-id='EP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>according to his eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP3_12' data-id='EP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In him and through faith in him we may approach God with freedom and confidence. </span>
<span class='v EP3_13' data-id='EP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory. </span></div>

<span class='v EP3_16' data-id='EP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being, </span>
<span class='v EP3_17' data-id='EP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, </span>
<span class='v EP3_18' data-id='EP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>may have power, together with all the Lord’s holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_19' data-id='EP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_20' data-id='EP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, </span>
<span class='v EP3_21' data-id='EP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen. </span></div></div>
