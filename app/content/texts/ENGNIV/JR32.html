<div class='s'>Jeremiah Buys a Field </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_1' data-id='JR32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class='v JR32_2' data-id='JR32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_3' data-id='JR32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him there, saying, “Why do you prophesy as you do? You say, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it. </span>
<span class='v JR32_4' data-id='JR32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the Babylonians<span class='note' id='footnote-1975'><a href='#note-1975' class='key'>*</a></span> but will certainly be given into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes. </span>
<span class='v JR32_5' data-id='JR32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will remain until I deal with him, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_6' data-id='JR32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah said, “The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v JR32_7' data-id='JR32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_8' data-id='JR32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Then, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_8' data-id='JR32_8'>“I knew that this was the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; </span>
<span class='v JR32_9' data-id='JR32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>so I bought the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-1976'><a href='#note-1976' class='key'>†</a></span> of silver. </span>
<span class='v JR32_10' data-id='JR32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the silver on the scales. </span>
<span class='v JR32_11' data-id='JR32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the unsealed copy— </span>
<span class='v JR32_12' data-id='JR32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard. </span></div>

<span class='v JR32_13' data-id='JR32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“In their presence I gave Baruch these instructions: </span>

<span class='v JR32_20' data-id='JR32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that is still yours. </span>
<span class='v JR32_21' data-id='JR32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror. </span>
<span class='v JR32_22' data-id='JR32_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You gave them this land you had sworn to give their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey. </span>
<span class='v JR32_23' data-id='JR32_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey you or follow your law; they did not do what you commanded them to do. So you brought all this disaster on them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_24' data-id='JR32_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city.

<span class='v JR32_25' data-id='JR32_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And though the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians, you, Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, say to me, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR32_26' data-id='JR32_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah: </span>

<span class='v JR32_28' data-id='JR32_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it. </span>
<span class='v JR32_29' data-id='JR32_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The Babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people aroused my anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods. </span></div>

<span class='v JR32_30' data-id='JR32_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but arouse my anger with what their hands have made, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>

<span class='v JR32_32' data-id='JR32_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The people of Israel and Judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR32_33' data-id='JR32_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They turned their backs to me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline. </span>
<span class='v JR32_34' data-id='JR32_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>They set up their vile images in the house that bears my Name and defiled it. </span>
<span class='v JR32_35' data-id='JR32_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>They built high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter my mind—that they should do such a detestable thing and so make Judah sin. </span></div>

<span class='v JR32_39' data-id='JR32_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>I will give them singleness of heart and action, so that they will always fear me and that all will then go well for them and for their children after them. </span>
