<div class='s'>David at Nob </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_1' data-id='S121_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David went to Nob, to Ahimelek the priest. Ahimelek trembled when he met him, and asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_2' data-id='S121_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>David answered Ahimelek the priest, “The king sent me on a mission and said to me, ‘No one is to know anything about the mission I am sending you on.’ As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. </span>
<span class='v S121_3' data-id='S121_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now then, what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever you can find.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_4' data-id='S121_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the priest answered David, “I don’t have any ordinary bread on hand; however, there is some consecrated bread here—provided the men have kept themselves from women.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_5' data-id='S121_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>David replied, “Indeed women have been kept from us, as usual whenever<span class='note' id='footnote-733'><a href='#note-733' class='key'>*</a></span> I set out. The men’s bodies are holy even on missions that are not holy. How much more so today!” </span>
<span class='v S121_6' data-id='S121_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, since there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence that had been removed from before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_7' data-id='S121_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; he was Doeg the Edomite, Saul’s chief shepherd. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_8' data-id='S121_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>David asked Ahimelek, “Don’t you have a spear or a sword here? I haven’t brought my sword or any other weapon, because the king’s mission was urgent.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_9' data-id='S121_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here; it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it; there is no sword here but that one.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_9' data-id='S121_9'>David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>David at Gath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_10' data-id='S121_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>That day David fled from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. </span>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the servants of Achish said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Isn’t he the one they sing about in their dances: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'>“ ‘Saul has slain his thousands, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S121_11' data-id='S121_11'>and David his tens of thousands’?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_12' data-id='S121_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>David took these words to heart and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. </span>
<span class='v S121_13' data-id='S121_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So he pretended to be insane in their presence; and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman, making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S121_14' data-id='S121_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He is insane! Why bring him to me? </span>
<span class='v S121_15' data-id='S121_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?” </span></div></div>
