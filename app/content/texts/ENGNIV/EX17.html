<div class='s'>Water From the Rock </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_1' data-id='EX17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The whole Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, traveling from place to place as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. </span>
<span class='v EX17_2' data-id='EX17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_2' data-id='EX17_2'>Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you put the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to the test?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_3' data-id='EX17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_4' data-id='EX17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Moses cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “What am I to do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_5' data-id='EX17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. </span>
<span class='v EX17_6' data-id='EX17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will stand there before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX17_7' data-id='EX17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he called the place Massah<span class='note' id='footnote-262'><a href='#note-262' class='key'>*</a></span> and Meribah<span class='note' id='footnote-263'><a href='#note-263' class='key'>†</a></span> because the Israelites quarreled and because they tested the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> saying, “Is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> among us or not?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Amalekites Defeated </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_8' data-id='EX17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. </span>
<span class='v EX17_9' data-id='EX17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_10' data-id='EX17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill. </span>
<span class='v EX17_11' data-id='EX17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning. </span>
<span class='v EX17_12' data-id='EX17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on one side, one on the other—so that his hands remained steady till sunset. </span>
<span class='v EX17_13' data-id='EX17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_14' data-id='EX17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that Joshua hears it, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX17_15' data-id='EX17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Moses built an altar and called it The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is my Banner. </span>
<span class='v EX17_16' data-id='EX17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He said, “Because hands were lifted up against<span class='note' id='footnote-264'><a href='#note-264' class='key'>‡</a></span> the throne of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>,<span class='note' id='footnote-265'><a href='#note-265' class='key'>§</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.” </span></div></div>
