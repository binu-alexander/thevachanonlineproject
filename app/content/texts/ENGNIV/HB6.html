<div class='s'>Warning Against Falling Away </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_1' data-id='HB6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death,<span class='note' id='footnote-3173'><a href='#note-3173' class='key'>*</a></span> and of faith in God, </span>

<span class='v HB6_3' data-id='HB6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And God permitting, we will do so. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_4' data-id='HB6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v HB6_5' data-id='HB6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age </span>
<span class='v HB6_6' data-id='HB6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and who have fallen<span class='note' id='footnote-3175'><a href='#note-3175' class='key'>‡</a></span> away, to be brought back to repentance. To their loss they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace. </span>
<span class='v HB6_7' data-id='HB6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of God. </span>
<span class='v HB6_8' data-id='HB6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed. In the end it will be burned. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_9' data-id='HB6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case—the things that have to do with salvation. </span>
<span class='v HB6_10' data-id='HB6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them. </span>
<span class='v HB6_11' data-id='HB6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>We want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end, so that what you hope for may be fully realized. </span>
<span class='v HB6_12' data-id='HB6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>We do not want you to become lazy, but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Certainty of God’s Promise </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_13' data-id='HB6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, </span>
<span class='v HB6_14' data-id='HB6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3176'><a href='#note-3176' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v HB6_15' data-id='HB6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_16' data-id='HB6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. </span>
<span class='v HB6_17' data-id='HB6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. </span>
<span class='v HB6_18' data-id='HB6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. </span>
<span class='v HB6_19' data-id='HB6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, </span>
<span class='v HB6_20' data-id='HB6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek. </span></div></div>
