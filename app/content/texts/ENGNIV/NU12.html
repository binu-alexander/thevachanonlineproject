<div class='s'>Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_1' data-id='NU12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses because of his Cushite wife, for he had married a Cushite. </span>
<span class='v NU12_2' data-id='NU12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Has the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t he also spoken through us?” And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> heard this. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_3' data-id='NU12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>(Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_4' data-id='NU12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>At once the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.” So the three of them went out. </span>
<span class='v NU12_5' data-id='NU12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came down in a pillar of cloud; he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When the two of them stepped forward, </span>
<span class='v NU12_6' data-id='NU12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>he said, “Listen to my words: </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU12_6' data-id='NU12_6'>I, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, reveal myself to them in visions, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU12_6' data-id='NU12_6'>I speak to them in dreams. </span></div>

<span class='v NU12_7' data-id='NU12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But this is not true of my servant Moses; </span></div>

<span class='v NU12_7' data-id='NU12_7'>he is faithful in all my house. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>With him I speak face to face, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'>clearly and not in riddles; </span></div>

<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'>he sees the form of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'>Why then were you not afraid </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'>to speak against my servant Moses?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_9' data-id='NU12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> burned against them, and he left them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_10' data-id='NU12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin was leprous<span class='note' id='footnote-445'><a href='#note-445' class='key'>*</a></span>—it became as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw that she had a defiling skin disease, </span>
<span class='v NU12_11' data-id='NU12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and he said to Moses, “Please, my lord, I ask you not to hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed. </span>
<span class='v NU12_12' data-id='NU12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_13' data-id='NU12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Moses cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “Please, God, heal her!” </span></div>

<span class='v NU12_14' data-id='NU12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she can be brought back.” </span>
<span class='v NU12_15' data-id='NU12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on till she was brought back. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU12_16' data-id='NU12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>After that, the people left Hazeroth and encamped in the Desert of Paran. </span></div></div>
