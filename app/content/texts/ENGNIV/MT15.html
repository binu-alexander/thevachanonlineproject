<div class='s'>That Which Defiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_1' data-id='MT15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked, </span>
<span class='v MT15_2' data-id='MT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They don’t wash their hands before they eat!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_3' data-id='MT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_4' data-id='MT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2488'><a href='#note-2488' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>and ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2489'><a href='#note-2489' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v MT15_5' data-id='MT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is ‘devoted to God,’ </span></span>
<span class='v MT15_6' data-id='MT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>they are not to ‘honor their father or mother’ with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_7' data-id='MT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:</span></span></div>

<span class='v MT15_10' data-id='MT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <span class='wj'>“Listen and understand.</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_11' data-id='MT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>What goes into someone’s mouth does not defile them, but what comes out of their mouth, that is what defiles them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_12' data-id='MT15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_13' data-id='MT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_15' data-id='MT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.” </span></div>

<span class='v MT15_16' data-id='MT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Are you still so dull?”</span> Jesus asked them. </span>
<span class='v MT15_17' data-id='MT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Don’t you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body?</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_18' data-id='MT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the things that come out of a person’s mouth come from the heart, and these defile them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_19' data-id='MT15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.</span></span>
<span class='v MT15_20' data-id='MT15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Faith of a Canaanite Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_21' data-id='MT15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MT15_22' data-id='MT15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_23' data-id='MT15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_24' data-id='MT15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class='wj'>“I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_25' data-id='MT15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_26' data-id='MT15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_27' data-id='MT15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_28' data-id='MT15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.”</span> And her daughter was healed at that moment. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_29' data-id='MT15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down. </span>
<span class='v MT15_30' data-id='MT15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them. </span>
<span class='v MT15_31' data-id='MT15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_32' data-id='MT15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus called his disciples to him and said, <span class='wj'>“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may collapse on the way.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_33' data-id='MT15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“How many loaves do you have?”</span> Jesus asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'>“Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_35' data-id='MT15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. </span>
<span class='v MT15_36' data-id='MT15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people. </span>
<span class='v MT15_37' data-id='MT15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class='v MT15_38' data-id='MT15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children. </span>
<span class='v MT15_39' data-id='MT15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>After Jesus had sent the crowd away, he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of Magadan. </span></div></div>
