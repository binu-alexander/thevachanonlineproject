<span class='v RV13_2' data-id='RV13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The beast I saw resembled a leopard, but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority. </span>
<span class='v RV13_3' data-id='RV13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. </span>
