<div class='c'>28</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_1' data-id='S128_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In those days the Philistines gathered their forces to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_2' data-id='S128_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>David said, “Then you will see for yourself what your servant can do.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_2' data-id='S128_2'>Achish replied, “Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Saul and the Medium at Endor </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_3' data-id='S128_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_4' data-id='S128_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Philistines assembled and came and set up camp at Shunem, while Saul gathered all Israel and set up camp at Gilboa. </span>
<span class='v S128_5' data-id='S128_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid; terror filled his heart. </span>
<span class='v S128_6' data-id='S128_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He inquired of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did not answer him by dreams or Urim or prophets. </span>
<span class='v S128_7' data-id='S128_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Saul then said to his attendants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I may go and inquire of her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_7' data-id='S128_7'>“There is one in Endor,” they said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_8' data-id='S128_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Saul disguised himself, putting on other clothes, and at night he and two men went to the woman. “Consult a spirit for me,” he said, “and bring up for me the one I name.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_9' data-id='S128_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land. Why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_10' data-id='S128_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Saul swore to her by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “As surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives, you will not be punished for this.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_11' data-id='S128_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_11' data-id='S128_11'>“Bring up Samuel,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_12' data-id='S128_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out at the top of her voice and said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_13' data-id='S128_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_13' data-id='S128_13'>The woman said, “I see a ghostly figure<span class='note' id='footnote-742'><a href='#note-742' class='key'>*</a></span> coming up out of the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_14' data-id='S128_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“What does he look like?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_14' data-id='S128_14'>“An old man wearing a robe is coming up,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_14' data-id='S128_14'>Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_15' data-id='S128_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_15' data-id='S128_15'>“I am in great distress,” Saul said. “The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has departed from me. He no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams. So I have called on you to tell me what to do.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_16' data-id='S128_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Samuel said, “Why do you consult me, now that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has departed from you and become your enemy? </span>
<span class='v S128_17' data-id='S128_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has done what he predicted through me. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors—to David. </span>
<span class='v S128_18' data-id='S128_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because you did not obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> or carry out his fierce wrath against the Amalekites, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has done this to you today. </span>
<span class='v S128_19' data-id='S128_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will deliver both Israel and you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will also give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_20' data-id='S128_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground, filled with fear because of Samuel’s words. His strength was gone, for he had eaten nothing all that day and all that night. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_21' data-id='S128_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When the woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly shaken, she said, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do. </span>
<span class='v S128_22' data-id='S128_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_23' data-id='S128_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He refused and said, “I will not eat.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_23' data-id='S128_23'>But his men joined the woman in urging him, and he listened to them. He got up from the ground and sat on the couch. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S128_24' data-id='S128_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The woman had a fattened calf at the house, which she butchered at once. She took some flour, kneaded it and baked bread without yeast. </span>
<span class='v S128_25' data-id='S128_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then she set it before Saul and his men, and they ate. That same night they got up and left. </span></div></div>
