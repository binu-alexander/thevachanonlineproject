<span class='v DT32_50' data-id='DT32_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>There on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. </span>
<span class='v DT32_51' data-id='DT32_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>This is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the Israelites at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the Israelites. </span>
