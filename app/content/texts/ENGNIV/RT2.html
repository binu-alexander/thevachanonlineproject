<div class='s'>Ruth Meets Boaz in the Grain Field </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_1' data-id='RT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a man of standing from the clan of Elimelek, whose name was Boaz. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_2' data-id='RT2_2'>Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” </span>
<span class='v RT2_3' data-id='RT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_4' data-id='RT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Just then Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be with you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_4' data-id='RT2_4'>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless you!” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_5' data-id='RT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Boaz asked the overseer of his harvesters, “Who does that young woman belong to?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_6' data-id='RT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The overseer replied, “She is the Moabite who came back from Moab with Naomi. </span>
<span class='v RT2_7' data-id='RT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She said, ‘Please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters.’ She came into the field and has remained here from morning till now, except for a short rest in the shelter.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_8' data-id='RT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Boaz said to Ruth, “My daughter, listen to me. Don’t go and glean in another field and don’t go away from here. Stay here with the women who work for me. </span>
<span class='v RT2_9' data-id='RT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Watch the field where the men are harvesting, and follow along after the women. I have told the men not to lay a hand on you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_10' data-id='RT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>At this, she bowed down with her face to the ground. She asked him, “Why have I found such favor in your eyes that you notice me—a foreigner?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_11' data-id='RT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Boaz replied, “I’ve been told all about what you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband—how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before. </span>
<span class='v RT2_12' data-id='RT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_13' data-id='RT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“May I continue to find favor in your eyes, my lord,” she said. “You have put me at ease by speaking kindly to your servant—though I do not have the standing of one of your servants.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_14' data-id='RT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here. Have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_14' data-id='RT2_14'>When she sat down with the harvesters, he offered her some roasted grain. She ate all she wanted and had some left over. </span>
<span class='v RT2_15' data-id='RT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As she got up to glean, Boaz gave orders to his men, “Let her gather among the sheaves and don’t reprimand her. </span>
<span class='v RT2_16' data-id='RT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Even pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up, and don’t rebuke her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_17' data-id='RT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Ruth gleaned in the field until evening. Then she threshed the barley she had gathered, and it amounted to about an ephah.<span class='note' id='footnote-665'><a href='#note-665' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v RT2_18' data-id='RT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_19' data-id='RT2_19'>Then Ruth told her mother-in-law about the one at whose place she had been working. “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_20' data-id='RT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless him!” Naomi said to her daughter-in-law. “He has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead.” She added, “That man is our close relative; he is one of our guardian-redeemers.<span class='note' id='footnote-666'><a href='#note-666' class='key'>†</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_21' data-id='RT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Ruth the Moabite said, “He even said to me, ‘Stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_22' data-id='RT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, “It will be good for you, my daughter, to go with the women who work for him, because in someone else’s field you might be harmed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT2_23' data-id='RT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So Ruth stayed close to the women of Boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished. And she lived with her mother-in-law. </span></div></div>
