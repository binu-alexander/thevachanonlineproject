<span class='v DT12_1' data-id='DT12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>These are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you to possess—as long as you live in the land. </span>
<span class='v DT12_2' data-id='DT12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Destroy completely all the places on the high mountains, on the hills and under every spreading tree, where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods. </span>
<span class='v DT12_3' data-id='DT12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and burn their Asherah poles in the fire; cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT12_4' data-id='DT12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You must not worship the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God in their way. </span>
<span class='v DT12_5' data-id='DT12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you are to seek the place the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. To that place you must go; </span>
<span class='v DT12_6' data-id='DT12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. </span>
<span class='v DT12_7' data-id='DT12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There, in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has blessed you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT12_8' data-id='DT12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit, </span>
<span class='v DT12_9' data-id='DT12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you. </span>
<span class='v DT12_10' data-id='DT12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety. </span>

<span class='v DT12_12' data-id='DT12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And there rejoice before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own. </span>
<span class='v DT12_13' data-id='DT12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. </span>

<span class='v DT12_16' data-id='DT12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. </span>

<span class='v DT12_21' data-id='DT12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If the place where the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God chooses to put his Name is too far away from you, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given you, as I have commanded you, and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want. </span>
<span class='v DT12_22' data-id='DT12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Eat them as you would gazelle or deer. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat. </span>
<span class='v DT12_23' data-id='DT12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But be sure you do not eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not eat the life with the meat. </span>
<span class='v DT12_24' data-id='DT12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. </span>
<span class='v DT12_25' data-id='DT12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT12_26' data-id='DT12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give, and go to the place the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will choose. </span>
<span class='v DT12_27' data-id='DT12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, both the meat and the blood.

<span class='v DT12_28' data-id='DT12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Be careful to obey all these regulations I am giving you, so that it may always go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span></div>
