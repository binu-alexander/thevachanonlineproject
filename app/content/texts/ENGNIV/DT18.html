<span class='v DT18_1' data-id='DT18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Levitical priests—indeed, the whole tribe of Levi—are to have no allotment or inheritance with Israel. They shall live on the food offerings presented to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for that is their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v DT18_2' data-id='DT18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is their inheritance, as he promised them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT18_3' data-id='DT18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep: the shoulder, the internal organs and the meat from the head. </span>
<span class='v DT18_4' data-id='DT18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You are to give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine and olive oil, and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep, </span>
<span class='v DT18_5' data-id='DT18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s name always. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT18_6' data-id='DT18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If a Levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in Israel where he is living, and comes in all earnestness to the place the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will choose, </span>
<span class='v DT18_7' data-id='DT18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>he may minister in the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> his God like all his fellow Levites who serve there in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v DT18_8' data-id='DT18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He is to share equally in their benefits, even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT18_9' data-id='DT18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When you enter the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. </span>
<span class='v DT18_10' data-id='DT18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, </span>
<span class='v DT18_11' data-id='DT18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. </span>
<span class='v DT18_12' data-id='DT18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Anyone who does these things is detestable to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; because of these same detestable practices the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will drive out those nations before you. </span>
<span class='v DT18_13' data-id='DT18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You must be blameless before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span></div>

<span class='v DT18_14' data-id='DT18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination. But as for you, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has not permitted you to do so. </span>
<span class='v DT18_15' data-id='DT18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him. </span>
<span class='v DT18_16' data-id='DT18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For this is what you asked of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT18_17' data-id='DT18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me: “What they say is good. </span>
<span class='v DT18_18' data-id='DT18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth. He will tell them everything I command him. </span>
<span class='v DT18_19' data-id='DT18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name. </span>
<span class='v DT18_20' data-id='DT18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, is to be put to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT18_21' data-id='DT18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You may say to yourselves, “How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>?” </span>
<span class='v DT18_22' data-id='DT18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> does not take place or come true, that is a message the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously, so do not be alarmed. </span></div></div>
