<div class='s'>Northern Kings Defeated </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_1' data-id='JS11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Akshaph, </span>
<span class='v JS11_2' data-id='JS11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and to the northern kings who were in the mountains, in the Arabah south of Kinnereth, in the western foothills and in Naphoth Dor on the west; </span>
<span class='v JS11_3' data-id='JS11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>to the Canaanites in the east and west; to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites in the hill country; and to the Hivites below Hermon in the region of Mizpah. </span>
<span class='v JS11_4' data-id='JS11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots—a huge army, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. </span>
<span class='v JS11_5' data-id='JS11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>All these kings joined forces and made camp together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_6' data-id='JS11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because by this time tomorrow I will hand all of them, slain, over to Israel. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_7' data-id='JS11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So Joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them, </span>
<span class='v JS11_8' data-id='JS11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave them into the hand of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them all the way to Greater Sidon, to Misrephoth Maim, and to the Valley of Mizpah on the east, until no survivors were left. </span>
<span class='v JS11_9' data-id='JS11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Joshua did to them as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had directed: He hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_10' data-id='JS11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and put its king to the sword. (Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.) </span>
<span class='v JS11_11' data-id='JS11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Everyone in it they put to the sword. They totally destroyed<span class='note' id='footnote-576'><a href='#note-576' class='key'>*</a></span> them, not sparing anyone that breathed, and he burned Hazor itself. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_12' data-id='JS11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword. He totally destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded. </span>
<span class='v JS11_13' data-id='JS11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Yet Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds—except Hazor, which Joshua burned. </span>
<span class='v JS11_14' data-id='JS11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities, but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them, not sparing anyone that breathed. </span>
<span class='v JS11_15' data-id='JS11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_16' data-id='JS11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So Joshua took this entire land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the western foothills, the Arabah and the mountains of Israel with their foothills, </span>
<span class='v JS11_17' data-id='JS11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death. </span>
<span class='v JS11_18' data-id='JS11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time. </span>
<span class='v JS11_19' data-id='JS11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not one city made a treaty of peace with the Israelites, who took them all in battle. </span>
<span class='v JS11_20' data-id='JS11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For it was the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that he might destroy them totally, exterminating them without mercy, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_21' data-id='JS11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that time Joshua went and destroyed the Anakites from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir and Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua totally destroyed them and their towns. </span>
<span class='v JS11_22' data-id='JS11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>No Anakites were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath and Ashdod did any survive. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS11_23' data-id='JS11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So Joshua took the entire land, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had directed Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war. </span></div></div>
