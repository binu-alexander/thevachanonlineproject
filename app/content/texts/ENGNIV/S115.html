<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Rejects Saul as King </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_1' data-id='S115_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to Saul, “I am the one the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent to anoint you king over his people Israel; so listen now to the message from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S115_2' data-id='S115_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. </span>
<span class='v S115_3' data-id='S115_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy<span class='note' id='footnote-718'><a href='#note-718' class='key'>*</a></span> all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_4' data-id='S115_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Saul summoned the men and mustered them at Telaim—two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand from Judah. </span>
<span class='v S115_5' data-id='S115_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Saul went to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the ravine. </span>
<span class='v S115_6' data-id='S115_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave the Amalekites so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they came up out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_7' data-id='S115_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Saul attacked the Amalekites all the way from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v S115_8' data-id='S115_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive, and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword. </span>
<span class='v S115_9' data-id='S115_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But Saul and the army spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, the fat calves<span class='note' id='footnote-719'><a href='#note-719' class='key'>†</a></span> and lambs—everything that was good. These they were unwilling to destroy completely, but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_10' data-id='S115_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Samuel: </span>
<span class='v S115_11' data-id='S115_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“I regret that I have made Saul king, because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions.” Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> all that night. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_12' data-id='S115_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul, but he was told, “Saul has gone to Carmel. There he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to Gilgal.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_13' data-id='S115_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Samuel reached him, Saul said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless you! I have carried out the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s instructions.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_14' data-id='S115_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears? What is this lowing of cattle that I hear?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_15' data-id='S115_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Saul answered, “The soldiers brought them from the Amalekites; they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, but we totally destroyed the rest.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_16' data-id='S115_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Enough!” Samuel said to Saul. “Let me tell you what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me last night.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_16' data-id='S115_16'>“Tell me,” Saul replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_17' data-id='S115_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Samuel said, “Although you were once small in your own eyes, did you not become the head of the tribes of Israel? The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> anointed you king over Israel. </span>
<span class='v S115_18' data-id='S115_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he sent you on a mission, saying, ‘Go and completely destroy those wicked people, the Amalekites; wage war against them until you have wiped them out.’ </span>
<span class='v S115_19' data-id='S115_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Why did you not obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>? Why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_20' data-id='S115_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“But I did obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>,” Saul said. “I went on the mission the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> assigned me. I completely destroyed the Amalekites and brought back Agag their king. </span>
<span class='v S115_21' data-id='S115_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder, the best of what was devoted to God, in order to sacrifice them to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God at Gilgal.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_22' data-id='S115_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Samuel replied: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S115_22' data-id='S115_22'>“Does the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S115_22' data-id='S115_22'>as much as in obeying the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S115_22' data-id='S115_22'>To obey is better than sacrifice, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S115_22' data-id='S115_22'>and to heed is better than the fat of rams. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S115_23' data-id='S115_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For rebellion is like the sin of divination, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S115_23' data-id='S115_23'>and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S115_23' data-id='S115_23'>Because you have rejected the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S115_23' data-id='S115_23'>he has rejected you as king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_24' data-id='S115_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I violated the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s command and your instructions. I was afraid of the men and so I gave in to them. </span>
<span class='v S115_25' data-id='S115_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now I beg you, forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I may worship the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_26' data-id='S115_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Samuel said to him, “I will not go back with you. You have rejected the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has rejected you as king over Israel!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_27' data-id='S115_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught hold of the hem of his robe, and it tore. </span>
<span class='v S115_28' data-id='S115_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Samuel said to him, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors—to one better than you. </span>
<span class='v S115_29' data-id='S115_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a human being, that he should change his mind.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_30' data-id='S115_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Saul replied, “I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel; come back with me, so that I may worship the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God.” </span>
<span class='v S115_31' data-id='S115_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_32' data-id='S115_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_32' data-id='S115_32'>Agag came to him in chains.<span class='note' id='footnote-720'><a href='#note-720' class='key'>‡</a></span> And he thought, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_33' data-id='S115_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But Samuel said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v S115_33' data-id='S115_33'>“As your sword has made women childless, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v S115_33' data-id='S115_33'>so will your mother be childless among women.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v S115_33' data-id='S115_33'>And Samuel put Agag to death before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> at Gilgal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S115_34' data-id='S115_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel left for Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah of Saul. </span>
<span class='v S115_35' data-id='S115_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Until the day Samuel died, he did not go to see Saul again, though Samuel mourned for him. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel. </span></div></div>
