<span class='v R113_2' data-id='R113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He then said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and if it is the will of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God, let us send word far and wide to the rest of our people throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands, to come and join us. </span>
<span class='v R113_3' data-id='R113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let us bring the ark of our God back to us, for we did not inquire of<span class='note' id='footnote-1073'><a href='#note-1073' class='key'>*</a></span> it<span class='note' id='footnote-1074'><a href='#note-1074' class='key'>†</a></span> during the reign of Saul.” </span>
<span class='v R113_4' data-id='R113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly agreed to do this, because it seemed right to all the people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R113_5' data-id='R113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So David assembled all Israel, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim. </span>
<span class='v R113_6' data-id='R113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (Kiriath Jearim) to bring up from there the ark of God the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who is enthroned between the cherubim—the ark that is called by the Name. </span></div>

<span class='v R113_9' data-id='R113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they came to the threshing floor of Kidon, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen stumbled. </span>
<span class='v R113_10' data-id='R113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark. So he died there before God. </span></div>

<span class='v R113_11' data-id='R113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then David was angry because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.<span class='note' id='footnote-1075'><a href='#note-1075' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>

<span class='v R113_12' data-id='R113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” </span>
