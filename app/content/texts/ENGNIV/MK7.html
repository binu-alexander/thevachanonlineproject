<div class='s'>That Which Defiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_1' data-id='MK7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus </span>
<span class='v MK7_2' data-id='MK7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. </span>
<span class='v MK7_3' data-id='MK7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>(The Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, holding to the tradition of the elders. </span>
<span class='v MK7_4' data-id='MK7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash. And they observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers and kettles.<span class='note' id='footnote-2569'><a href='#note-2569' class='key'>*</a></span>) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_5' data-id='MK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees and teachers of the law asked Jesus, “Why don’t your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with defiled hands?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites; as it is written: </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'><span class='wj'>“ ‘These people honor me with their lips, </span></span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'><span class='wj'>but their hearts are far from me.</span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK7_7' data-id='MK7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>They worship me in vain; </span></span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK7_7' data-id='MK7_7'><span class='wj'>their teachings are merely human rules.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2570'><a href='#note-2570' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MK7_8' data-id='MK7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to human traditions.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_9' data-id='MK7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he continued, <span class='wj'>“You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2571'><a href='#note-2571' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>your own traditions!</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_10' data-id='MK7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2572'><a href='#note-2572' class='key'>§</a></span><span class='wj'>and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2573'><a href='#note-2573' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v MK7_11' data-id='MK7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)—</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_12' data-id='MK7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother.</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_13' data-id='MK7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_14' data-id='MK7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Again Jesus called the crowd to him and said, <span class='wj'>“Listen to me, everyone, and understand this.</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_15' data-id='MK7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Nothing outside a person can defile them by going into them. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles them.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2574'><a href='#note-2574' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_17' data-id='MK7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>After he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable. </span>
<span class='v MK7_18' data-id='MK7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Are you so dull?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Don’t you see that nothing that enters a person from the outside can defile them?</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_19' data-id='MK7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For it doesn’t go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body.”</span> (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_20' data-id='MK7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He went on: <span class='wj'>“What comes out of a person is what defiles them.</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_21' data-id='MK7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, </span></span>
<span class='v MK7_22' data-id='MK7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly.</span></span>
<span class='v MK7_23' data-id='MK7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>All these evils come from inside and defile a person.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Honors a Syrophoenician Woman’s Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_24' data-id='MK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of Tyre.<span class='note' id='footnote-2575'><a href='#note-2575' class='key'>‡</a></span> He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not keep his presence secret. </span>
<span class='v MK7_25' data-id='MK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In fact, as soon as she heard about him, a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an impure spirit came and fell at his feet. </span>
<span class='v MK7_26' data-id='MK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The woman was a Greek, born in Syrian Phoenicia. She begged Jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_27' data-id='MK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“First let the children eat all they want,”</span> he told her, <span class='wj'>“for it is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_28' data-id='MK7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Lord,” she replied, “even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_29' data-id='MK7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then he told her, <span class='wj'>“For such a reply, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_30' data-id='MK7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Deaf and Mute Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_31' data-id='MK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus left the vicinity of Tyre and went through Sidon, down to the Sea of Galilee and into the region of the Decapolis.<span class='note' id='footnote-2576'><a href='#note-2576' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v MK7_32' data-id='MK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>There some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Jesus to place his hand on him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_33' data-id='MK7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>After he took him aside, away from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers into the man’s ears. Then he spit and touched the man’s tongue. </span>
<span class='v MK7_34' data-id='MK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>He looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him, <span class='tl'>“Ephphatha!”</span> (which means <span class='wj'>“Be opened!”</span>). </span>
<span class='v MK7_35' data-id='MK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_36' data-id='MK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more he did so, the more they kept talking about it. </span>
<span class='v MK7_37' data-id='MK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>People were overwhelmed with amazement. “He has done everything well,” they said. “He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.” </span></div></div>
