<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_1' data-id='MK8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>During those days another large crowd gathered. Since they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said, </span>
<span class='v MK8_2' data-id='MK8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat.</span></span>
<span class='v MK8_3' data-id='MK8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If I send them home hungry, they will collapse on the way, because some of them have come a long distance.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_4' data-id='MK8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>His disciples answered, “But where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_5' data-id='MK8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“How many loaves do you have?”</span> Jesus asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_5' data-id='MK8_5'>“Seven,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_6' data-id='MK8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. When he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so. </span>
<span class='v MK8_7' data-id='MK8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They had a few small fish as well; he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them. </span>
<span class='v MK8_8' data-id='MK8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The people ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class='v MK8_9' data-id='MK8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>About four thousand were present. After he had sent them away, </span>
<span class='v MK8_10' data-id='MK8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_11' data-id='MK8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees came and began to question Jesus. To test him, they asked him for a sign from heaven. </span>
<span class='v MK8_12' data-id='MK8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He sighed deeply and said, <span class='wj'>“Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK8_13' data-id='MK8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Yeast of the Pharisees and Herod </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_14' data-id='MK8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. </span>
<span class='v MK8_15' data-id='MK8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Be careful,”</span> Jesus warned them. <span class='wj'>“Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and that of Herod.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_16' data-id='MK8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_17' data-id='MK8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked them: <span class='wj'>“Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</span></span>
<span class='v MK8_18' data-id='MK8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And don’t you remember?</span></span>
<span class='v MK8_19' data-id='MK8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_19' data-id='MK8_19'>“Twelve,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_20' data-id='MK8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_20' data-id='MK8_20'>They answered, “Seven.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_21' data-id='MK8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Do you still not understand?”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Blind Man at Bethsaida </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_22' data-id='MK8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and begged Jesus to touch him. </span>
<span class='v MK8_23' data-id='MK8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on him, Jesus asked, <span class='wj'>“Do you see anything?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_24' data-id='MK8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_25' data-id='MK8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. </span>
<span class='v MK8_26' data-id='MK8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent him home, saying, <span class='wj'>“Don’t even go into</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2577'><a href='#note-2577' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>the village.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_27' data-id='MK8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Who do people say I am?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_28' data-id='MK8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_29' data-id='MK8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But what about you?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Who do you say I am?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_29' data-id='MK8_29'>Peter answered, “You are the Messiah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_30' data-id='MK8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Predicts His Death </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_31' data-id='MK8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again. </span>
<span class='v MK8_32' data-id='MK8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_33' data-id='MK8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But when Jesus turned and looked at his disciples, he rebuked Peter. <span class='wj'>“Get behind me, Satan!”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK8_34' data-id='MK8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: <span class='wj'>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</span></span>
<span class='v MK8_35' data-id='MK8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For whoever wants to save their life</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2578'><a href='#note-2578' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will save it.</span></span>
