<div class='s'>Ahijah’s Prophecy Against Jeroboam </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_1' data-id='K114_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became ill, </span>
<span class='v K114_2' data-id='K114_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go, disguise yourself, so you won’t be recognized as the wife of Jeroboam. Then go to Shiloh. Ahijah the prophet is there—the one who told me I would be king over this people. </span>
<span class='v K114_3' data-id='K114_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.” </span>
<span class='v K114_4' data-id='K114_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Jeroboam’s wife did what he said and went to Ahijah’s house in Shiloh. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_4' data-id='K114_4'>Now Ahijah could not see; his sight was gone because of his age. </span>
<span class='v K114_5' data-id='K114_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had told Ahijah, “Jeroboam’s wife is coming to ask you about her son, for he is ill, and you are to give her such and such an answer. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_6' data-id='K114_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So when Ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why this pretense? I have been sent to you with bad news. </span>
<span class='v K114_7' data-id='K114_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Go, tell Jeroboam that this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘I raised you up from among the people and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. </span>
<span class='v K114_8' data-id='K114_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, but you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart, doing only what was right in my eyes. </span>
<span class='v K114_9' data-id='K114_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made for yourself other gods, idols made of metal; you have aroused my anger and turned your back on me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_10' data-id='K114_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Because of this, I am going to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam. I will cut off from Jeroboam every last male in Israel—slave or free.<span class='note' id='footnote-904'><a href='#note-904' class='key'>*</a></span> I will burn up the house of Jeroboam as one burns dung, until it is all gone. </span>
<span class='v K114_11' data-id='K114_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Dogs will eat those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the country. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has spoken!’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_12' data-id='K114_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“As for you, go back home. When you set foot in your city, the boy will die. </span>
<span class='v K114_13' data-id='K114_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only one belonging to Jeroboam who will be buried, because he is the only one in the house of Jeroboam in whom the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has found anything good. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_14' data-id='K114_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam. Even now this is beginning to happen.<span class='note' id='footnote-905'><a href='#note-905' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v K114_15' data-id='K114_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will strike Israel, so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water. He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they aroused the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger by making Asherah poles.<span class='note' id='footnote-906'><a href='#note-906' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v K114_16' data-id='K114_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he will give Israel up because of the sins Jeroboam has committed and has caused Israel to commit.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_17' data-id='K114_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah. As soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house, the boy died. </span>
<span class='v K114_18' data-id='K114_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said through his servant the prophet Ahijah. </span></div>

<span class='v K114_19' data-id='K114_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The other events of Jeroboam’s reign, his wars and how he ruled, are written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel. </span>

<span class='v K114_21' data-id='K114_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_22' data-id='K114_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Judah did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. By the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than those who were before them had done. </span>
<span class='v K114_23' data-id='K114_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They also set up for themselves high places, sacred stones and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree. </span>
<span class='v K114_24' data-id='K114_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had driven out before the Israelites. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K114_25' data-id='K114_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. </span>

<span class='v K114_27' data-id='K114_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. </span>
