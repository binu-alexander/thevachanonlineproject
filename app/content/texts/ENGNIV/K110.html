<div class='s'>The Queen of Sheba Visits Solomon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_1' data-id='K110_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon and his relationship to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, she came to test Solomon with hard questions. </span>
<span class='v K110_2' data-id='K110_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Arriving at Jerusalem with a very great caravan—with camels carrying spices, large quantities of gold, and precious stones—she came to Solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind. </span>
<span class='v K110_3' data-id='K110_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her. </span>
<span class='v K110_4' data-id='K110_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_6' data-id='K110_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true. </span>
<span class='v K110_7' data-id='K110_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But I did not believe these things until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me; in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report I heard. </span>
<span class='v K110_8' data-id='K110_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>How happy your people must be! How happy your officials, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! </span>
<span class='v K110_9' data-id='K110_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_10' data-id='K110_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And she gave the king 120 talents<span class='note' id='footnote-888'><a href='#note-888' class='key'>†</a></span> of gold, large quantities of spices, and precious stones. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_11' data-id='K110_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>(Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir; and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood<span class='note' id='footnote-889'><a href='#note-889' class='key'>‡</a></span> and precious stones. </span>
<span class='v K110_12' data-id='K110_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The king used the almugwood to make supports<span class='note' id='footnote-890'><a href='#note-890' class='key'>§</a></span> for the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and for the royal palace, and to make harps and lyres for the musicians. So much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_13' data-id='K110_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired and asked for, besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon’s Splendor </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_14' data-id='K110_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The weight of the gold that Solomon received yearly was 666 talents,<span class='note' id='footnote-891'><a href='#note-891' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v K110_15' data-id='K110_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the Arabian kings and the governors of the territories. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_16' data-id='K110_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-892'><a href='#note-892' class='key'>†</a></span> of gold went into each shield. </span>
<span class='v K110_17' data-id='K110_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, with three minas<span class='note' id='footnote-893'><a href='#note-893' class='key'>‡</a></span> of gold in each shield. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_18' data-id='K110_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with fine gold. </span>
<span class='v K110_19' data-id='K110_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. </span>
<span class='v K110_20' data-id='K110_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom. </span>
<span class='v K110_21' data-id='K110_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon’s days. </span>
<span class='v K110_22' data-id='K110_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The king had a fleet of trading ships<span class='note' id='footnote-894'><a href='#note-894' class='key'>§</a></span> at sea along with the ships of Hiram. Once every three years it returned, carrying gold, silver and ivory, and apes and baboons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K110_23' data-id='K110_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>King Solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth. </span>
<span class='v K110_24' data-id='K110_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The whole world sought audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. </span>
<span class='v K110_25' data-id='K110_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Year after year, everyone who came brought a gift—articles of silver and gold, robes, weapons and spices, and horses and mules. </span></div>

<span class='v K110_26' data-id='K110_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,<span class='note' id='footnote-895'><a href='#note-895' class='key'>*</a></span> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K110_27' data-id='K110_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. </span>
<span class='v K110_28' data-id='K110_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue<span class='note' id='footnote-896'><a href='#note-896' class='key'>†</a></span>—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price. </span>
<span class='v K110_29' data-id='K110_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty.<span class='note' id='footnote-897'><a href='#note-897' class='key'>‡</a></span> They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans. </span></div></div>
