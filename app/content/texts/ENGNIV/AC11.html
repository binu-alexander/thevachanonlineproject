<div class='s'>Peter Explains His Actions </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_1' data-id='AC11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The apostles and the believers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. </span>
<span class='v AC11_2' data-id='AC11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him </span>
<span class='v AC11_3' data-id='AC11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and said, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_4' data-id='AC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Starting from the beginning, Peter told them the whole story: </span>
<span class='v AC11_5' data-id='AC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was. </span>
<span class='v AC11_6' data-id='AC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles and birds. </span>
<span class='v AC11_7' data-id='AC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a voice telling me, <span class='wj'>‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_8' data-id='AC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“I replied, ‘Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_9' data-id='AC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“The voice spoke from heaven a second time, <span class='wj'>‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’ </span></span>
<span class='v AC11_10' data-id='AC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_11' data-id='AC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying. </span>
<span class='v AC11_12' data-id='AC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. </span>
<span class='v AC11_13' data-id='AC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. </span>
<span class='v AC11_14' data-id='AC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_15' data-id='AC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning. </span>
<span class='v AC11_16' data-id='AC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then I remembered what the Lord had said: <span class='wj'>‘John baptized with</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2815'><a href='#note-2815' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>water, but you will be baptized with</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2816'><a href='#note-2816' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>the Holy Spirit.’ </span></span>
<span class='v AC11_17' data-id='AC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So if God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could stand in God’s way?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_18' data-id='AC11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, “So then, even to Gentiles God has granted repentance that leads to life.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Church in Antioch </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_19' data-id='AC11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that broke out when Stephen was killed traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews. </span>
<span class='v AC11_20' data-id='AC11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC11_21' data-id='AC11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_22' data-id='AC11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>News of this reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_23' data-id='AC11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When he arrived and saw what the grace of God had done, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts. </span>
<span class='v AC11_24' data-id='AC11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_25' data-id='AC11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, </span>
<span class='v AC11_26' data-id='AC11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_27' data-id='AC11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_28' data-id='AC11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. (This happened during the reign of Claudius.) </span>
<span class='v AC11_29' data-id='AC11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The disciples, as each one was able, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea. </span>
<span class='v AC11_30' data-id='AC11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul. </span></div></div>
