<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>the stately trees are ruined! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>Wail, oaks of Bashan; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>the dense forest has been cut down! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Listen to the wail of the shepherds; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>their rich pastures are destroyed! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>Listen to the roar of the lions; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>the lush thicket of the Jordan is ruined! </span></div>
<div class='s'>Two Shepherds </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_4' data-id='ZC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God says: “Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_5' data-id='ZC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Their buyers slaughter them and go unpunished. Those who sell them say, ‘Praise the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I am rich!’ Their own shepherds do not spare them. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_6' data-id='ZC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. “I will give everyone into the hands of their neighbors and their king. They will devastate the land, and I will not rescue anyone from their hands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_7' data-id='ZC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I shepherded the flock marked for slaughter, particularly the oppressed of the flock. Then I took two staffs and called one Favor and the other Union, and I shepherded the flock. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_8' data-id='ZC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In one month I got rid of the three shepherds. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_8' data-id='ZC11_8'>The flock detested me, and I grew weary of them </span>
<span class='v ZC11_9' data-id='ZC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and said, “I will not be your shepherd. Let the dying die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_10' data-id='ZC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then I took my staff called Favor and broke it, revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_11' data-id='ZC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It was revoked on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_12' data-id='ZC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I told them, “If you think it best, give me my pay; but if not, keep it.” So they paid me thirty pieces of silver. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_13' data-id='ZC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the handsome price at which they valued me! So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter at the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_14' data-id='ZC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then I broke my second staff called Union, breaking the family bond between Judah and Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_15' data-id='ZC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_16' data-id='ZC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For I am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost, or seek the young, or heal the injured, or feed the healthy, but will eat the meat of the choice sheep, tearing off their hooves. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Woe to the worthless shepherd, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>who deserts the flock! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>May his arm be completely withered, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>his right eye totally blinded!” </span></div></div>
