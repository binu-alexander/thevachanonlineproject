<div class='s'>The Covenant Confirmed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_1' data-id='EX24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. You are to worship at a distance, </span>
<span class='v EX24_2' data-id='EX24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but Moses alone is to approach the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; the others must not come near. And the people may not come up with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_3' data-id='EX24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When Moses went and told the people all the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s words and laws, they responded with one voice, “Everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has said we will do.” </span>
<span class='v EX24_4' data-id='EX24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Moses then wrote down everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_4' data-id='EX24_4'>He got up early the next morning and built an altar at the foot of the mountain and set up twelve stone pillars representing the twelve tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX24_5' data-id='EX24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as fellowship offerings to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v EX24_6' data-id='EX24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Moses took half of the blood and put it in bowls, and the other half he splashed against the altar. </span>
<span class='v EX24_7' data-id='EX24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They responded, “We will do everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has said; we will obey.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_8' data-id='EX24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has made with you in accordance with all these words.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_9' data-id='EX24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel went up </span>
<span class='v EX24_10' data-id='EX24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of lapis lazuli, as bright blue as the sky. </span>
<span class='v EX24_11' data-id='EX24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But God did not raise his hand against these leaders of the Israelites; they saw God, and they ate and drank. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_12' data-id='EX24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain and stay here, and I will give you the tablets of stone with the law and commandments I have written for their instruction.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_13' data-id='EX24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Moses set out with Joshua his aide, and Moses went up on the mountain of God. </span>
<span class='v EX24_14' data-id='EX24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Aaron and Hur are with you, and anyone involved in a dispute can go to them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX24_15' data-id='EX24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it, </span>
<span class='v EX24_16' data-id='EX24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> settled on Mount Sinai. For six days the cloud covered the mountain, and on the seventh day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> called to Moses from within the cloud. </span>
<span class='v EX24_17' data-id='EX24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>To the Israelites the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> looked like a consuming fire on top of the mountain. </span>
<span class='v EX24_18' data-id='EX24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Moses entered the cloud as he went on up the mountain. And he stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights. </span></div></div>
