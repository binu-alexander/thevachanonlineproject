<span class='v JG12_1' data-id='JG12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Ephraimite forces were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We’re going to burn down your house over your head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG12_2' data-id='JG12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jephthah answered, “I and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the Ammonites, and although I called, you didn’t save me out of their hands. </span>
<span class='v JG12_3' data-id='JG12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When I saw that you wouldn’t help, I took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave me the victory over them. Now why have you come up today to fight me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG12_4' data-id='JG12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jephthah then called together the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. The Gileadites struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You Gileadites are renegades from Ephraim and Manasseh.” </span>
<span class='v JG12_5' data-id='JG12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim, and whenever a survivor of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he replied, “No,” </span>
<span class='v JG12_6' data-id='JG12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>they said, “All right, say ‘Shibboleth.’ ” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce the word correctly, they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time. </span></div>
