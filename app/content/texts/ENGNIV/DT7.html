<span class='v DT7_1' data-id='DT7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you— </span>
<span class='v DT7_2' data-id='DT7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and when the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally.<span class='note' id='footnote-518'><a href='#note-518' class='key'>*</a></span> Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy. </span>
<span class='v DT7_3' data-id='DT7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons, </span>
<span class='v DT7_4' data-id='DT7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you. </span>
<span class='v DT7_5' data-id='DT7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is what you are to do to them: Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles<span class='note' id='footnote-519'><a href='#note-519' class='key'>†</a></span> and burn their idols in the fire. </span>
<span class='v DT7_6' data-id='DT7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For you are a people holy to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people, his treasured possession. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT7_7' data-id='DT7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. </span>
<span class='v DT7_8' data-id='DT7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But it was because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v DT7_9' data-id='DT7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Know therefore that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commandments. </span>
<span class='v DT7_10' data-id='DT7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DT7_10' data-id='DT7_10'>those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction; </span></div>

<span class='v DT7_11' data-id='DT7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT7_12' data-id='DT7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors. </span>
<span class='v DT7_13' data-id='DT7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you. </span>
<span class='v DT7_14' data-id='DT7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You will be blessed more than any other people; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young. </span>
<span class='v DT7_15' data-id='DT7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all who hate you. </span>
<span class='v DT7_16' data-id='DT7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You must destroy all the peoples the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God gives over to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that will be a snare to you. </span></div>

<span class='v DT7_17' data-id='DT7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You may say to yourselves, “These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?” </span>
<span class='v DT7_18' data-id='DT7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt. </span>
<span class='v DT7_19' data-id='DT7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm, with which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God brought you out. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear. </span>
<span class='v DT7_20' data-id='DT7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Moreover, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished. </span>
<span class='v DT7_21' data-id='DT7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not be terrified by them, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. </span>
<span class='v DT7_22' data-id='DT7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will multiply around you. </span>
<span class='v DT7_23' data-id='DT7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. </span>
<span class='v DT7_24' data-id='DT7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He will give their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand up against you; you will destroy them. </span>
<span class='v DT7_25' data-id='DT7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span>
<span class='v DT7_26' data-id='DT7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction. </span></div></div>
