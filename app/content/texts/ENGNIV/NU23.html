<span class='v NU23_2' data-id='NU23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Balak did as Balaam said, and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_3' data-id='NU23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will come to meet with me. Whatever he reveals to me I will tell you.” Then he went off to a barren height. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_4' data-id='NU23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>God met with him, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars, and on each altar I have offered a bull and a ram.” </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_5' data-id='NU23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Go back to Balak and give him this word.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_6' data-id='NU23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering, with all the Moabite officials. </span>

<span class='v NU23_14' data-id='NU23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. </span></div>
