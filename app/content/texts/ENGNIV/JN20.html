<div class='s'>The Empty Tomb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_1' data-id='JN20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance. </span>
<span class='v JN20_2' data-id='JN20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So she came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_3' data-id='JN20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Peter and the other disciple started for the tomb. </span>
<span class='v JN20_4' data-id='JN20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Both were running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. </span>
<span class='v JN20_5' data-id='JN20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in. </span>
<span class='v JN20_6' data-id='JN20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, </span>
<span class='v JN20_7' data-id='JN20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>as well as the cloth that had been wrapped around Jesus’ head. The cloth was still lying in its place, separate from the linen. </span>
<span class='v JN20_8' data-id='JN20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed. </span>
<span class='v JN20_9' data-id='JN20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(They still did not understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.) </span>
<span class='v JN20_10' data-id='JN20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples went back to where they were staying. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_11' data-id='JN20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now Mary stood outside the tomb crying. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb </span>
<span class='v JN20_12' data-id='JN20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_13' data-id='JN20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_13' data-id='JN20_13'>“They have taken my Lord away,” she said, “and I don’t know where they have put him.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_14' data-id='JN20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realize that it was Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_15' data-id='JN20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He asked her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, why are you crying? Who is it you are looking for?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_15' data-id='JN20_15'>Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will get him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_16' data-id='JN20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Mary.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_16' data-id='JN20_16'>She turned toward him and cried out in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”). </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_17' data-id='JN20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_18' data-id='JN20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to His Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_19' data-id='JN20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <span class='wj'>“Peace be with you!”</span></span>
<span class='v JN20_20' data-id='JN20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_21' data-id='JN20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Again Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN20_22' data-id='JN20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And with that he breathed on them and said, <span class='wj'>“Receive the Holy Spirit.</span></span>
<span class='v JN20_23' data-id='JN20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to Thomas </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_24' data-id='JN20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now Thomas (also known as Didymus<span class='note' id='footnote-2774'><a href='#note-2774' class='key'>*</a></span>), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came. </span>
<span class='v JN20_25' data-id='JN20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_25' data-id='JN20_25'>But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_26' data-id='JN20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, <span class='wj'>“Peace be with you!”</span></span>
<span class='v JN20_27' data-id='JN20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to Thomas, <span class='wj'>“Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_28' data-id='JN20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_29' data-id='JN20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</span></span></div>
