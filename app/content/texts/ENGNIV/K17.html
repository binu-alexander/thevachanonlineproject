<div class='s'>Solomon Builds His Palace </div>

<span class='v K17_1' data-id='K17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It took Solomon thirteen years, however, to complete the construction of his palace. </span>
<span class='v K17_2' data-id='K17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He built the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon a hundred cubits long, fifty wide and thirty high,<span class='note' id='footnote-853'><a href='#note-853' class='key'>*</a></span> with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams. </span>
<span class='v K17_3' data-id='K17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns—forty-five beams, fifteen to a row. </span>
<span class='v K17_4' data-id='K17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Its windows were placed high in sets of three, facing each other. </span>
<span class='v K17_5' data-id='K17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>All the doorways had rectangular frames; they were in the front part in sets of three, facing each other.<span class='note' id='footnote-854'><a href='#note-854' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_6' data-id='K17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide.<span class='note' id='footnote-855'><a href='#note-855' class='key'>‡</a></span> In front of it was a portico, and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_7' data-id='K17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He built the throne hall, the Hall of Justice, where he was to judge, and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling.<span class='note' id='footnote-856'><a href='#note-856' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_8' data-id='K17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the palace in which he was to live, set farther back, was similar in design. Solomon also made a palace like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had married. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_9' data-id='K17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>All these structures, from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves, were made of blocks of high-grade stone cut to size and smoothed on their inner and outer faces. </span>
<span class='v K17_10' data-id='K17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The foundations were laid with large stones of good quality, some measuring ten cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-857'><a href='#note-857' class='key'>*</a></span> and some eight.<span class='note' id='footnote-858'><a href='#note-858' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_11' data-id='K17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Above were high-grade stones, cut to size, and cedar beams. </span>
<span class='v K17_12' data-id='K17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams, as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with its portico. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Temple’s Furnishings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_13' data-id='K17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>King Solomon sent to Tyre and brought Huram,<span class='note' id='footnote-859'><a href='#note-859' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_14' data-id='K17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>whose mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali and whose father was from Tyre and a skilled craftsman in bronze. Huram was filled with wisdom, with understanding and with knowledge to do all kinds of bronze work. He came to King Solomon and did all the work assigned to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_15' data-id='K17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He cast two bronze pillars, each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference.<span class='note' id='footnote-860'><a href='#note-860' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_16' data-id='K17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; each capital was five cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-861'><a href='#note-861' class='key'>*</a></span> high. </span>
<span class='v K17_17' data-id='K17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>A network of interwoven chains adorned the capitals on top of the pillars, seven for each capital. </span>
<span class='v K17_18' data-id='K17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He made pomegranates in two rows<span class='note' id='footnote-862'><a href='#note-862' class='key'>†</a></span> encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars.<span class='note' id='footnote-863'><a href='#note-863' class='key'>‡</a></span> He did the same for each capital. </span>
<span class='v K17_19' data-id='K17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies, four cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-864'><a href='#note-864' class='key'>§</a></span> high. </span>
<span class='v K17_20' data-id='K17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>On the capitals of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped part next to the network, were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around. </span>
<span class='v K17_21' data-id='K17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He erected the pillars at the portico of the temple. The pillar to the south he named Jakin<span class='note' id='footnote-865'><a href='#note-865' class='key'>*</a></span> and the one to the north Boaz.<span class='note' id='footnote-866'><a href='#note-866' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_22' data-id='K17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The capitals on top were in the shape of lilies. And so the work on the pillars was completed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_23' data-id='K17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He made the Sea of cast metal, circular in shape, measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high. It took a line of thirty cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-867'><a href='#note-867' class='key'>‡</a></span> to measure around it. </span>
<span class='v K17_24' data-id='K17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Below the rim, gourds encircled it—ten to a cubit. The gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the Sea. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_25' data-id='K17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center. </span>
<span class='v K17_26' data-id='K17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It was a handbreadth<span class='note' id='footnote-868'><a href='#note-868' class='key'>§</a></span> in thickness, and its rim was like the rim of a cup, like a lily blossom. It held two thousand baths.<span class='note' id='footnote-869'><a href='#note-869' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_27' data-id='K17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He also made ten movable stands of bronze; each was four cubits long, four wide and three high.<span class='note' id='footnote-870'><a href='#note-870' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v K17_28' data-id='K17_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>This is how the stands were made: They had side panels attached to uprights. </span>
<span class='v K17_29' data-id='K17_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>On the panels between the uprights were lions, bulls and cherubim—and on the uprights as well. Above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work. </span>
<span class='v K17_30' data-id='K17_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and each had a basin resting on four supports, cast with wreaths on each side. </span>
<span class='v K17_31' data-id='K17_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>On the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit<span class='note' id='footnote-871'><a href='#note-871' class='key'>‡</a></span> deep. This opening was round, and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half.<span class='note' id='footnote-872'><a href='#note-872' class='key'>§</a></span> Around its opening there was engraving. The panels of the stands were square, not round. </span>
<span class='v K17_32' data-id='K17_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The four wheels were under the panels, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand. The diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half. </span>
<span class='v K17_33' data-id='K17_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The wheels were made like chariot wheels; the axles, rims, spokes and hubs were all of cast metal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_34' data-id='K17_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Each stand had four handles, one on each corner, projecting from the stand. </span>
<span class='v K17_35' data-id='K17_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>At the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit<span class='note' id='footnote-873'><a href='#note-873' class='key'>*</a></span> deep. The supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand. </span>
<span class='v K17_36' data-id='K17_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He engraved cherubim, lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels, in every available space, with wreaths all around. </span>
<span class='v K17_37' data-id='K17_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>This is the way he made the ten stands. They were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K17_38' data-id='K17_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>He then made ten bronze basins, each holding forty baths<span class='note' id='footnote-874'><a href='#note-874' class='key'>†</a></span> and measuring four cubits across, one basin to go on each of the ten stands. </span>
<span class='v K17_39' data-id='K17_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north. He placed the Sea on the south side, at the southeast corner of the temple. </span>
<span class='v K17_40' data-id='K17_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>He also made the pots<span class='note' id='footnote-875'><a href='#note-875' class='key'>‡</a></span> and shovels and sprinkling bowls. </span></div>
