<div class='s'>Abram and Lot Separate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_1' data-id='GN13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him. </span>
<span class='v GN13_2' data-id='GN13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_3' data-id='GN13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>From the Negev he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier </span>
<span class='v GN13_4' data-id='GN13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_5' data-id='GN13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. </span>
<span class='v GN13_6' data-id='GN13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together. </span>
<span class='v GN13_7' data-id='GN13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And quarreling arose between Abram’s herders and Lot’s. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_8' data-id='GN13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Abram said to Lot, “Let’s not have any quarreling between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives. </span>
<span class='v GN13_9' data-id='GN13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part company. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_10' data-id='GN13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, like the land of Egypt. (This was before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) </span>
<span class='v GN13_11' data-id='GN13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company: </span>
<span class='v GN13_12' data-id='GN13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom. </span>
<span class='v GN13_13' data-id='GN13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_14' data-id='GN13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Look around from where you are, to the north and south, to the east and west. </span>
<span class='v GN13_15' data-id='GN13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring<span class='note' id='footnote-56'><a href='#note-56' class='key'>*</a></span> forever. </span>
<span class='v GN13_16' data-id='GN13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your offspring could be counted. </span>
<span class='v GN13_17' data-id='GN13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN13_18' data-id='GN13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Abram went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he pitched his tents. There he built an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div></div>
