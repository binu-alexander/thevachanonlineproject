<span class='v LK17_1' data-id='LK17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>He said to the disciples, <span class='wj'>“It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come, but woe to him through whom they come! </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_2' data-id='LK17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_3' data-id='LK17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Be careful. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him. If he repents, forgive him. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_4' data-id='LK17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times returns, saying, ‘I repent,’ you shall forgive him.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK17_5' data-id='LK17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith.” </span></div>

<span class='v LK17_6' data-id='LK17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The Lord said, <span class='wj'>“If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you would tell this sycamore tree, ‘Be uprooted, and be planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_7' data-id='LK17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say when he comes in from the field, ‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’ </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_8' data-id='LK17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and will not rather tell him, ‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’? </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_9' data-id='LK17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_10' data-id='LK17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’ ” </span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK17_14' data-id='LK17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he saw them, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go and show yourselves to the priests.”</span> As they went, they were cleansed. </span>
<span class='v LK17_15' data-id='LK17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice. </span>

<span class='v LK17_19' data-id='LK17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Get up, and go your way. Your faith has healed you.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_20' data-id='LK17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Being asked by the Pharisees when God’s Kingdom would come, he answered them, <span class='wj'>“God’s Kingdom doesn’t come with observation; </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_21' data-id='LK17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>neither will they say, ‘Look, here!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ for behold, God’s Kingdom is within you.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK17_24' data-id='LK17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for as the lightning, when it flashes out of one part under the sky, shines to another part under the sky; so will the Son of Man be in his day. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_25' data-id='LK17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But first, he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_26' data-id='LK17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As it was in the days of Noah, even so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_27' data-id='LK17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They ate, they drank, they married, and they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ship, and the flood came and destroyed them all. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_28' data-id='LK17_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Likewise, even as it was in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_29' data-id='LK17_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulfur from the sky and destroyed them all. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK17_30' data-id='LK17_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It will be the same way in the day that the Son of Man is revealed. </span> </span>
