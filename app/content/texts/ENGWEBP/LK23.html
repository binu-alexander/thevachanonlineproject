<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_1' data-id='LK23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_2' data-id='LK23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_3' data-id='LK23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_3' data-id='LK23_3'>He answered him, <span class='wj'>“So you say.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_4' data-id='LK23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_5' data-id='LK23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_6' data-id='LK23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. </span>
<span class='v LK23_7' data-id='LK23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_8' data-id='LK23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_9' data-id='LK23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers. </span>
<span class='v LK23_10' data-id='LK23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_11' data-id='LK23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_12' data-id='LK23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_13' data-id='LK23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, </span>
<span class='v LK23_14' data-id='LK23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_15' data-id='LK23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_16' data-id='LK23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore chastise him and release him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_17' data-id='LK23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.<span class='note' id='footnote-909'><a href='#note-909' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK23_18' data-id='LK23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”— </span>
<span class='v LK23_19' data-id='LK23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_20' data-id='LK23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus, </span>
<span class='v LK23_21' data-id='LK23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_22' data-id='LK23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_23' data-id='LK23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed. </span>
<span class='v LK23_24' data-id='LK23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. </span>
<span class='v LK23_25' data-id='LK23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_26' data-id='LK23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK23_27' data-id='LK23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_28' data-id='LK23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, turning to them, said, <span class='wj'>“Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span> </span>
<span class='v LK23_29' data-id='LK23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’ </span> </span>
<span class='v LK23_30' data-id='LK23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-910'><a href='#note-910' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK23_31' data-id='LK23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_32' data-id='LK23_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death. </span>
<span class='v LK23_33' data-id='LK23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When they came to the place that is called “The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_34' data-id='LK23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_34' data-id='LK23_34'>Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots. </span>
<span class='v LK23_35' data-id='LK23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_36' data-id='LK23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar, </span>
<span class='v LK23_37' data-id='LK23_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_38' data-id='LK23_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_39' data-id='LK23_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_40' data-id='LK23_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation? </span>
<span class='v LK23_41' data-id='LK23_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_42' data-id='LK23_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_43' data-id='LK23_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_44' data-id='LK23_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>It was now about the sixth hour,<span class='note' id='footnote-911'><a href='#note-911' class='key'>†</a></span> and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.<span class='note' id='footnote-912'><a href='#note-912' class='key'>‡</a></span> </span>
<span class='v LK23_45' data-id='LK23_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two. </span>
<span class='v LK23_46' data-id='LK23_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, <span class='wj'>“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!”</span> Having said this, he breathed his last. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_47' data-id='LK23_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_48' data-id='LK23_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts. </span>
<span class='v LK23_49' data-id='LK23_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>All his acquaintances and the women who followed with him from Galilee stood at a distance, watching these things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_50' data-id='LK23_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man </span>
<span class='v LK23_51' data-id='LK23_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for God’s Kingdom: </span>
<span class='v LK23_52' data-id='LK23_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. </span>
<span class='v LK23_53' data-id='LK23_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid. </span>
<span class='v LK23_54' data-id='LK23_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near. </span>
<span class='v LK23_55' data-id='LK23_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid. </span>
