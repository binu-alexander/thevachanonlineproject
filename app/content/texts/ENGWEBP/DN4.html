<span class='v DN4_5' data-id='DN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I saw a dream which made me afraid; and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. </span>
<span class='v DN4_6' data-id='DN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream. </span>
<span class='v DN4_7' data-id='DN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the magicians, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came in; and I told the dream before them; but they didn’t make known to me its interpretation. </span>
<span class='v DN4_8' data-id='DN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. I told the dream before him, saying, </span></div>

<span class='v DN4_12' data-id='DN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The leaves of it were beautiful, and it had much fruit, and in it was food for all. The animals of the field had shade under it, and the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and all flesh was fed from it. </span></div>
<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_13' data-id='DN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from the sky. </span>
<span class='v DN4_14' data-id='DN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He cried aloud, and said this, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches! Shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit! Let the animals get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches. </span>
<span class='v DN4_15' data-id='DN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of the sky.

<span class='v DN4_19' data-id='DN4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was stricken mute for a while, and his thoughts troubled him. The king answered, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you.” </span></div>

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_28' data-id='DN4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class='v DN4_29' data-id='DN4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v DN4_30' data-id='DN4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The king spoke and said, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?” </span></div>

<span class='v DN4_33' data-id='DN4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>This was fulfilled the same hour on Nebuchadnezzar.

<div class='pi'>
<span class='v DN4_34' data-id='DN4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; </span></div>
