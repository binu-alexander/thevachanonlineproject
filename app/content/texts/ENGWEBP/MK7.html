<span class='v MK7_35' data-id='MK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. </span>
<span class='v MK7_36' data-id='MK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it. </span>
<span class='v MK7_37' data-id='MK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!” </span></div></div>
