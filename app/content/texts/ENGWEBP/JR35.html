<span class='v JR35_1' data-id='JR35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR35_2' data-id='JR35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s house, into one of the rooms, and give them wine to drink.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_3' data-id='JR35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his brothers, all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; </span>
<span class='v JR35_4' data-id='JR35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and I brought them into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the room of the princes, which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold. </span>
<span class='v JR35_5' data-id='JR35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_6' data-id='JR35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But they said, “We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink no wine, neither you, nor your sons, forever. </span>
<span class='v JR35_7' data-id='JR35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You shall not build a house, sow seed, plant a vineyard, or have any; but all your days you shall dwell in tents, that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’ </span>
<span class='v JR35_8' data-id='JR35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters; </span>
<span class='v JR35_9' data-id='JR35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in. We have no vineyard, field, or seed; </span>
<span class='v JR35_10' data-id='JR35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but we have lived in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. </span>
<span class='v JR35_11' data-id='JR35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, we said, ‘Come! Let’s go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians; so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_12' data-id='JR35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh’s word came to Jeremiah, saying, </span>

<span class='v JR35_14' data-id='JR35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons, not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they drink none, for they obey their father’s commandment; but I have spoken to you, rising up early and speaking, and you have not listened to me. </span>
<span class='v JR35_15' data-id='JR35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, ‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way, amend your doings, and don’t go after other gods to serve them, then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers:’ but you have not inclined your ear, nor listened to me. </span>
<span class='v JR35_16' data-id='JR35_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people has not listened to me.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_17' data-id='JR35_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Therefore Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_18' data-id='JR35_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, “Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he commanded you;’ </span>
<span class='v JR35_19' data-id='JR35_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>therefore Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’ ” </span></div></div>
