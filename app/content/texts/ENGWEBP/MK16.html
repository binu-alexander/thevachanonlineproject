<span class='v MK16_6' data-id='MK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Don’t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him! </span>
<span class='v MK16_7' data-id='MK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.’ ” </span></div>
