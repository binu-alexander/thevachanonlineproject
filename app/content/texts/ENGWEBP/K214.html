<span class='v K214_3' data-id='K214_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He did that which was right in Yahweh’s eyes, yet not like David his father. He did according to all that Joash his father had done. </span>
<span class='v K214_4' data-id='K214_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>However the high places were not taken away. The people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places. </span>
<span class='v K214_5' data-id='K214_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As soon as the kingdom was established in his hand, he killed his servants who had slain the king his father, </span>
<span class='v K214_6' data-id='K214_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but the children of the murderers he didn’t put to death; according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, as Yahweh commanded, saying, “The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall die for his own sin.” </span></div>

<span class='v K214_10' data-id='K214_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You have indeed struck Edom, and your heart has lifted you up. Enjoy the glory of it, and stay at home; for why should you meddle to your harm, that you fall, even you, and Judah with you?’ ” </span>
<span class='v K214_11' data-id='K214_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Amaziah would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah. </span>
