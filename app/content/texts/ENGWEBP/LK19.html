<span class='v LK19_2' data-id='LK19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. </span>
<span class='v LK19_3' data-id='LK19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He was trying to see who Jesus was, and couldn’t because of the crowd, because he was short. </span>
<span class='v LK19_4' data-id='LK19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He ran on ahead, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was going to pass that way. </span>
<span class='v LK19_5' data-id='LK19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him, and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” </span> </span>
<span class='v LK19_6' data-id='LK19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He hurried, came down, and received him joyfully. </span>
<span class='v LK19_7' data-id='LK19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When they saw it, they all murmured, saying, “He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.” </span></div>

<span class='v LK19_8' data-id='LK19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor. If I have wrongfully exacted anything of anyone, I restore four times as much.” </span></div>

<span class='v LK19_11' data-id='LK19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately. </span>
<span class='v LK19_12' data-id='LK19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He said therefore, <span class='wj'>“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. </span> </span>

<span class='v LK19_29' data-id='LK19_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>When he came near to Bethsphage<span class='note' id='footnote-896'><a href='#note-896' class='key'>†</a></span> and Bethany, at the mountain that is called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, </span>
<span class='v LK19_30' data-id='LK19_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>saying, <span class='wj'>“Go your way into the village on the other side, in which, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, which no man had ever sat upon. Untie it and bring it. </span> </span>

<span class='v LK19_32' data-id='LK19_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Those who were sent went away, and found things just as he had told them. </span>
<span class='v LK19_33' data-id='LK19_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?” </span>
<span class='v LK19_34' data-id='LK19_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>They said, “The Lord needs it.” </span>
<span class='v LK19_35' data-id='LK19_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then they brought it to Jesus. They threw their cloaks on the colt, and sat Jesus on them. </span>
<span class='v LK19_36' data-id='LK19_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>As he went, they spread their cloaks on the road. </span>
<span class='v LK19_37' data-id='LK19_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>As he was now getting near, at the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen, </span>
<span class='v LK19_38' data-id='LK19_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>saying, “Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord! <span class='note' id='footnote-897'><a href='#note-897' class='key'>✡</a></span> Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest!” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK19_41' data-id='LK19_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>When he came near, he saw the city and wept over it, </span>
