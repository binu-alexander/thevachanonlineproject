<div class='p'>
<span class='v R117_2' data-id='R117_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.” </span></div>

<span class='v R117_5' data-id='R117_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another. </span>
<span class='v R117_6' data-id='R117_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’ ” ’ </span></div>

<span class='v R117_7' data-id='R117_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh of Armies says, “I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel. </span>
<span class='v R117_8' data-id='R117_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who are in the earth. </span>
<span class='v R117_9' data-id='R117_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will not waste them any more, as at the first, </span>
<span class='v R117_10' data-id='R117_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house. </span>
<span class='v R117_11' data-id='R117_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It will happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </span>

<span class='v R117_21' data-id='R117_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt? </span>
<span class='v R117_22' data-id='R117_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For you made your people Israel your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God. </span>
<span class='v R117_23' data-id='R117_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken. </span>
<span class='v R117_24' data-id='R117_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.’ </span>
<span class='v R117_25' data-id='R117_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you. </span>
<span class='v R117_26' data-id='R117_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant. </span>
