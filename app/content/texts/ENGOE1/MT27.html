<span class='v MT27_1' data-id='MT27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At daybreak all the chief priests and the elders of the people consulted together against Jesus, to bring about his death. </span>
<span class='v MT27_2' data-id='MT27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They put him in chains and led him away, and gave him up to the Roman Governor, Pilate. </span>
<span class='v MT27_3' data-id='MT27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that Jesus was condemned, repented of what he had done, and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders. </span>
<span class='v MT27_4' data-id='MT27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“I did wrong in betraying a good man to his death,” he said. “What has that to do with us?” they replied. “You must see to that yourself.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_5' data-id='MT27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Judas flung down the pieces of silver in the Temple, and left; and went away and hanged himself. </span>
<span class='v MT27_6' data-id='MT27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The chief priests took the pieces of silver, but they said, “We must not put them into the Temple treasury, because they are blood-money.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_7' data-id='MT27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So, after consultation, they bought with them the ‘Potter's Field’ for a burial-ground for foreigners; </span>
<span class='v MT27_8' data-id='MT27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and that is why that field is called the ‘Field of Blood’ to this very day. </span>
<span class='v MT27_9' data-id='MT27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then it was that these words spoken by the prophet Jeremiah were fulfilled — ‘They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, whom some of the people of Israel valued, </span>
<span class='v MT27_10' data-id='MT27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and gave them for the Potter's field, as the Lord commanded me.’ </span>
<span class='v MT27_11' data-id='MT27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Jesus was brought before the Roman Governor. “Are you the king of the Jews?” asked the Governor. <span class='wj'>“It is true,”</span> answered Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_12' data-id='MT27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>While charges were being brought against him by the chief priests and elders, Jesus made no reply. </span>
<span class='v MT27_13' data-id='MT27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said to him, “Don't you hear how many accusations they are making against you?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_14' data-id='MT27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Yet Jesus made no reply — not even a single word; at which the Governor was greatly astonished. </span>
<span class='v MT27_15' data-id='MT27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now, at the feast, the Governor was accustomed to grant the people the release of any one prisoner whom they might choose. </span>
<span class='v MT27_16' data-id='MT27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. </span>
<span class='v MT27_17' data-id='MT27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So, when the people had collected, Pilate said to them, “Which do you wish me to release for you? Barabbas? Or Jesus who is called ‘Christ’?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_18' data-id='MT27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For he knew that it was out of jealousy that they had given Jesus up to him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_19' data-id='MT27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>While he was still on the Bench, his wife sent this message to him — “Do not have anything to do with that good man, for I have been very unhappy today in a dream because of him.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_20' data-id='MT27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to kill Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_21' data-id='MT27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The Governor, however, said to them, “Which of these two do you wish me to release for you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_21' data-id='MT27_21'>“Barabbas,” they answered. </span>
<span class='v MT27_22' data-id='MT27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“What then,” Pilate asked, “should I do with Jesus who is called ‘Christ?’ ” “Crucify him,” they all replied. </span>
<span class='v MT27_23' data-id='MT27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“Why, what harm has he done?” he asked. But they kept shouting furiously, “Crucify him!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_24' data-id='MT27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When Pilate saw that his efforts were unavailing, but that, on the contrary, a riot was beginning, he took some water, and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying as he did so, “I am not answerable for this bloodshed; you must see to it yourselves.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_25' data-id='MT27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And all the people answered, “His blood be on our heads and on our children's!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_26' data-id='MT27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The Pilate released Barabbas to them; but Jesus he scourged, and gave him up to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_27' data-id='MT27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>After that, the Governor's soldiers took Jesus with them into the Government house, and gathered the whole garrison around him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_28' data-id='MT27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They stripped him, and put on him a red military cloak, </span>
<span class='v MT27_29' data-id='MT27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>and having twisted some thorns into a crown, put it on his head, and a rod in his right hand, and then, going down on their knees before him, they mocked him. “Long life to you, king of the Jews!” they said. </span>
<span class='v MT27_30' data-id='MT27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They spat at him and, taking the rod, kept striking him on the head; </span>
<span class='v MT27_31' data-id='MT27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and, when they had left off mocking him, they took off the military cloak, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_32' data-id='MT27_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>As they were on their way out, they came upon a man from Cyrene of the name of Simon; and they compelled him to go with them to carry the cross. </span>
<span class='v MT27_33' data-id='MT27_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>On reaching a place named Golgotha (a place named from its likeness to a skull), </span>
<span class='v MT27_34' data-id='MT27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>they gave him some wine to drink which had been mixed with gall; but after tasting it, Jesus refused to drink it. </span>
<span class='v MT27_35' data-id='MT27_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>When they had crucified him, they divided his clothes amongst them by casting lots. </span>
<span class='v MT27_36' data-id='MT27_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then they sat down, and kept watch over him there. </span>
<span class='v MT27_37' data-id='MT27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Above his head they fixed the accusation against him written out — ‘THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.’ </span>
<span class='v MT27_38' data-id='MT27_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>At the same time two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right, the other on the left. </span>
<span class='v MT27_39' data-id='MT27_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>The passers-by railed at him, shaking their heads as they said, </span>
<span class='v MT27_40' data-id='MT27_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>“You who ‘destroy the Temple and build one in three days,’ save yourself! If you are God's Son, come down from the cross!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_41' data-id='MT27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>In the same way the chief priests, with the Teaches of the Law and elders, said in mockery, </span>
<span class='v MT27_42' data-id='MT27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the ‘king of Israel’! Why doesn't he come down from the cross now, then we will believe in him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_43' data-id='MT27_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He has trusted in God; if God wants him, let him deliver him now; for he said ‘I am God's Son.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MT27_44' data-id='MT27_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Even the robbers, who were crucified with him, insulted him in the same way. </span>
<span class='v MT27_45' data-id='MT27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>After midday a darkness came over all the country, lasting until three in the afternoon. </span>
<span class='v MT27_46' data-id='MT27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>About three Jesus called out loudly, <span class='wj'>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabacthani”</span> — that is to say, <span class='wj'>‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT27_47' data-id='MT27_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Some of those standing by heard this, and said, “The man is calling for Elijah!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_48' data-id='MT27_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>One of them immediately ran and took a sponge, and, filling it with common wine, put it on the end of a rod, and offered it to him to drink. </span>
<span class='v MT27_49' data-id='MT27_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But the rest said, “Wait and let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”<span class='note' id='footnote-4'><a href='#note-4' class='key'>*</a></span> </span>
<span class='v MT27_50' data-id='MT27_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, uttering another loud cry, gave up his spirit. </span>
<span class='v MT27_51' data-id='MT27_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Suddenly the Temple curtain was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were torn asunder, </span>
<span class='v MT27_52' data-id='MT27_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>the tombs opened, and the bodies of many of God's people who had fallen asleep rose, </span>
<span class='v MT27_53' data-id='MT27_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>and they, leaving their tombs, went, after the resurrection of Jesus, into the Holy City, and appeared to many people. </span>
<span class='v MT27_54' data-id='MT27_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>The Roman captain, and the men with him who were watching Jesus, on seeing the earthquake and all that was happening, became greatly frightened and exclaimed, “This must indeed have been God's Son!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_55' data-id='MT27_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>There were many women there, watching from a distance, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had been attending on him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_56' data-id='MT27_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Amongst them were Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_57' data-id='MT27_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>When evening had fallen, there came a rich man belonging to Ramah, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_58' data-id='MT27_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>He went to see Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Pilate ordered it to be given him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_59' data-id='MT27_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen sheet, </span>
<span class='v MT27_60' data-id='MT27_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>and laid it in his newly made tomb which he had cut in the rock; and, before he left, he rolled a great stone against the entrance of the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MT27_61' data-id='MT27_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Mary of Magdala and the other Mary remained behind, sitting in front of the grave. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_62' data-id='MT27_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>The next day — that is, the day following the Preparation-day — the chief priests and Pharisees came in a body to Pilate, and said, </span>
<span class='v MT27_63' data-id='MT27_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>“Sir, we remember that, during his lifetime, that impostor said <span class='wj'>‘I will rise after three days.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT27_64' data-id='MT27_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>So order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal him, and then say to the people ‘He has risen from the dead,’ when the latest imposture will be worse than the first.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_65' data-id='MT27_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>“You may have a guard,” was Pilate's reply; “go and make the tomb as secure as you can.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_66' data-id='MT27_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>So they went and made the tomb secure, by sealing the stone, in presence of the guard. </span></div></div>
