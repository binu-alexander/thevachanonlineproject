<span class='v J12_1' data-id='J12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My children, I am writing to you to keep you from sinning. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father — Jesus Christ, the righteous. </span>
<span class='v J12_2' data-id='J12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but the sins of the whole world. </span>
<span class='v J12_3' data-id='J12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It is by keeping God's commands that we can be sure we know him. </span>
<span class='v J12_4' data-id='J12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Whoever says “I know him,” but does not keep his commands, is a liar. The truth has no place in them. </span>
<span class='v J12_5' data-id='J12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the person who keeps God's word, in them the love of God has indeed reached its perfection. This is how we can be sure we are in him: </span>
<span class='v J12_6' data-id='J12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>whoever claims to live in him should live just as Jesus did. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A new commandment </div>

<span class='v J12_7' data-id='J12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, it is no new command that I am writing to you, but an old command, which you have had from the beginning. That old command is the message you have already heard. </span>
<span class='v J12_8' data-id='J12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yet, in a way, it is a new command that I am writing to you — which is shown true in Christ's life and in yours — for the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. </span>
<span class='v J12_9' data-id='J12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The person who says that they are in the light, and yet hates others, is still in the darkness. </span>
<span class='v J12_10' data-id='J12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The person who loves others is always in the light, and there is nothing within them to cause them to stumble. </span>
<span class='v J12_11' data-id='J12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The person who hates is in the dark. They stumble along in the darkness; they do not know where they are going because the darkness blinds them. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_15' data-id='J12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not love the world or what the world can offer. When anyone loves the world, there is no love for the Father in them. </span>
<span class='v J12_16' data-id='J12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For all that the world can offer — the desires for physical pleasure, the enticements to the eye, the arrogance of wealth — belongs, not to the Father, but to the world. </span>
<span class='v J12_17' data-id='J12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the world, and all that it gratifies, is passing away, but they who do God's will remain for ever. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Warnings against an antichrist </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_18' data-id='J12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>My children, it is the last hour. You were told that an antichrist was coming; and many antichrists have already arisen. This is why we know that this is the last hour. </span>
<span class='v J12_19' data-id='J12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>These people come from our ranks, but they were never truly part of us — if they had been then they would have stayed with us. They left so it would be clear that none of them really belonged to us. </span>
<span class='v J12_20' data-id='J12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You, however, have have been annointed by the Holy One. You all know the truth. </span>
<span class='v J12_21' data-id='J12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie can come from the truth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_22' data-id='J12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Who is a liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? That person is the antichrist — one who rejects the Father and the Son. </span>
<span class='v J12_23' data-id='J12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>No one who rejects the Son has the Father; to acknowledge the Son is to have the Father also. </span>
<span class='v J12_24' data-id='J12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>As for you, you must let what you have heard from the beginning continue to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning dwells in you, you will remain both in the Son and the Father. </span>
<span class='v J12_25' data-id='J12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And this is what he himself promised us — eternal life! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_26' data-id='J12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In writing this to you, I have in mind those who are trying to mislead you. </span>
<span class='v J12_27' data-id='J12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains with you. You do not need anyone to teach you. His anointing teaches you about everything. What it teaches you is true, it is not a lie. Do what it has taught you: abide in him. </span>
<span class='v J12_28' data-id='J12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Yes, my children, remain in him, so that when he appears our confidence doesn't fail us, and we are not ashamed to meet him at his coming. </span>
<span class='v J12_29' data-id='J12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Since you know he is righteous, you realise that that everyone who does what is right is his child. </span></div></div>
