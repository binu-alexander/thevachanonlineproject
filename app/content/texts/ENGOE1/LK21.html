<span class='v LK21_1' data-id='LK21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Looking up, Jesus saw the rich people putting their gifts into the chests for the Temple offerings. </span>
<span class='v LK21_2' data-id='LK21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He saw, too, a widow in poor circumstances putting two small coins into them. </span>
<span class='v LK21_3' data-id='LK21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I tell you”</span>, he said <span class='wj'>“that this poor widow has put in more than all the others;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_4' data-id='LK21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for everyone else here put in something from what he had to spare, while she, in her need, has put in all she had to live on.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK21_5' data-id='LK21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When some of them spoke about the Temple being decorated with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said, </span>
<span class='v LK21_6' data-id='LK21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“As for these things that you are looking at, a time is coming when not one stone will be left on another here. Every one will be thrown down.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_7' data-id='LK21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the disciples questioned Jesus, “But, teacher, when will this happen? And what sign will there be when this is near?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK21_8' data-id='LK21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“See that you are not led astray; for many will take my name, and come saying ‘I am He,’ and ‘The time is close at hand.’ Do not follow them.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_9' data-id='LK21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified, for these things must occur first; but the end will not be at once.”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_10' data-id='LK21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_11' data-id='LK21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and there will be great earthquakes, and plagues and famines in various places, and there will be terrible appearances and signs in the heavens.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_12' data-id='LK21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, and they will betray you to synagogues and put you in prison, when you will be brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_13' data-id='LK21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then will be your opportunity of witnessing for me.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_14' data-id='LK21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Make up your minds, therefore, not to prepare your defence;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_15' data-id='LK21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for I will myself give you words, and a wisdom which all your opponents together will be unable to resist or defy.</span> </span>

<span class='v LK21_20' data-id='LK21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As soon, however, as you see Jerusalem surrounded by armed camps, then you may know that the hour of her desecration is at hand.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_21' data-id='LK21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then those of you who are in Judea must take refuge in the mountains, those who are in Jerusalem must leave at once, and those who are in the country places must not go into it.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_22' data-id='LK21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For these are to be the days of vengeance, when all that scripture says will be fulfilled.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_23' data-id='LK21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Alas for pregnant women, and for those who are nursing infants in those days! For there will be great suffering in the land, and anger against this people.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_24' data-id='LK21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be taken prisoners to every land, and Jerusalem will be under the heel of the Gentiles, until their day is over — as it will be.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_25' data-id='LK21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>There will be signs, too, in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth despair amongst the nations, in their dismay at the roar of the sea and the surge.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_26' data-id='LK21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>People's hearts will fail them through dread of what is coming upon the world; for the forces of the heavens will be convulsed.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_27' data-id='LK21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then will be seen the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_28' data-id='LK21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, when these things begin to occur, look upwards and lift your heads, for your deliverance will be at hand.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK21_29' data-id='LK21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then he taught them a lesson, saying — <span class='wj'>“Look at the fig tree and all the other trees.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_30' data-id='LK21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As soon as they shoot, you know, as you look at them, without being told, that summer is near.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_31' data-id='LK21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And so may you, as soon as you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_32' data-id='LK21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you that even the present generation will not pass away until all has taken place.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_33' data-id='LK21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The heavens and the earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_34' data-id='LK21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Be on your guard or your minds will become dulled by debauches or drunkenness or the anxieties of life, and 'that day' will close on you suddenly like a trap.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_35' data-id='LK21_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For come it will on all who are living upon the face of the whole earth.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK21_36' data-id='LK21_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Be on the watch at all times, and pray that you may have strength to escape all that is destined to happen, and to stand in the presence of the Son of Man.”</span> </span></div>
