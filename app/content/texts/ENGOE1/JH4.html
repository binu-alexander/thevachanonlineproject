<div class='s'>Jonah sulks </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_1' data-id='JH4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But this seemed very wrong to Jonah and he became angry. </span>
<span class='v JH4_2' data-id='JH4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, “Ah, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, wasn't this what I said when I was still in my own country? That was why I fled at once to Tarshish; for I knew that you are a gracious and merciful God, patient, and loving and ready to forgive. </span>
<span class='v JH4_3' data-id='JH4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Therefore, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I beg you, take my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live!” </span>
<span class='v JH4_4' data-id='JH4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “Are you doing right in being angry?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_5' data-id='JH4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah went out of the city and sat down on the east side, and there made a hut for himself and sat under it, waiting to see what would become of the city. </span>
<span class='v JH4_6' data-id='JH4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> arranged for a bush to grow up over Jonah as a shade for his head to make him comfortable. The bush gave Jonah great pleasure; </span>
<span class='v JH4_7' data-id='JH4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but at dawn the next day God arranged for a worm which attacked the bush, so that it wilted. </span>
<span class='v JH4_8' data-id='JH4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when the sun rose, God arranged a hot east wind. And the sun beat upon Jonah's head, so that he was faint and begged that he might die, saying, “It is better for me to die than to live.” </span>
<span class='v JH4_9' data-id='JH4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But God said to Jonah, “Are you doing right in being angry about the bush?” He replied, “I have every right to be as angry as I could possibly be!” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jonah is rebuked </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_10' data-id='JH4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “You care about a bush which has cost you no trouble and which you have not made grow, which came up in a night and wilted in a night. </span>
<span class='v JH4_11' data-id='JH4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Should I not care for the great city Nineveh, in which there are one hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left; and many cattle too?” </span></div></div>
