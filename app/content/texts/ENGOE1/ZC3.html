<span class='v ZC3_1' data-id='ZC3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then he showed me Joshua, the high priest, standing before the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the Adversary standing at his right hand to accuse him. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_2' data-id='ZC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to the Adversary, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> rebuke you, Adversary! The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?” </span>
<span class='v ZC3_3' data-id='ZC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and was standing before the messenger. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_4' data-id='ZC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The messenger said to those who stood before him, “Take off his filthy garments.” Then to Joshua he said, “I have taken your guilt from you and I will clothe you in priestly robes.” </span>
<span class='v ZC3_5' data-id='ZC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he ordered: “Set a clean turban upon his head.” So they set a clean turban on his head, and clothed him with garments. The messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was standing by. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC3_6' data-id='ZC3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> testified to Joshua: </span>
<span class='v ZC3_7' data-id='ZC3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts says: “If you walk in my ways, and if you will keep my instructions, then you will rule my house and keep my courts and I will give you a place of access amongst these that stand by. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_8' data-id='ZC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Hear now, Joshua the high priest, you and your associates who sit before me; for they are men who are a sign; for I am going to bring forth my servant the Branch. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_9' data-id='ZC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>On the stone that I have set before Joshua, on one stone, are seven facets. I will engrave it,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, “and I will remove the guilt of that land in one day. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_10' data-id='ZC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On that day,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, “you will each invite your neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.” </span></div></div>
