<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_1' data-id='JN11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now a man named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill; he belonged to the same village as Mary and her sister Martha. </span>
<span class='v JN11_2' data-id='JN11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This Mary, whose brother Lazarus was ill, was the Mary who anointed the Master with perfume, and wiped his feet with her hair. </span>
<span class='v JN11_3' data-id='JN11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The sisters, therefore, sent this message to Jesus — ‘Master, your friend is ill’; </span>
<span class='v JN11_4' data-id='JN11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and, when Jesus heard it, he said, <span class='wj'>“This illness is not to end in death, but is to redound to the honour of God, in order that the Son of God may be honoured through it.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_5' data-id='JN11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus. </span>
<span class='v JN11_6' data-id='JN11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yet, when he heard of the illness of Lazarus, he still stayed two days in the place where he was. </span>
<span class='v JN11_7' data-id='JN11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then, after that, he said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Let us go to Judea again.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_8' data-id='JN11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Rabbi,” they replied, “the authorities there were but just now seeking to stone you; and are you going there again?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_9' data-id='JN11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Are not there twelve hours in the day?”</span> answered Jesus. <span class='wj'>“If someone walks about in the daytime, they don't stumble, because they can see the light of the sun;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_10' data-id='JN11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, if they walk about at night, they stumble, because they have not the light.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_11' data-id='JN11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And, when he had said this, he added, <span class='wj'>“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may wake him.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_12' data-id='JN11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“If he has fallen asleep, Master, he will get well,” said the disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN11_13' data-id='JN11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But Jesus meant that he was dead; they, however, supposed that he was speaking of natural sleep. </span>
<span class='v JN11_14' data-id='JN11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them plainly, <span class='wj'>“Lazarus is dead;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_15' data-id='JN11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may learn to believe in me. But let us go to him.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_16' data-id='JN11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At this, Thomas, who was called ‘The Twin,’ said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_17' data-id='JN11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Jesus reached the place, he found that Lazarus had been four days in the tomb already. </span>
<span class='v JN11_18' data-id='JN11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Bethany being only about two miles from Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v JN11_19' data-id='JN11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>a number of the people had come there to comfort Martha and Mary because of brother's death. </span>
<span class='v JN11_20' data-id='JN11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him; but Mary sat quietly at home. </span>
<span class='v JN11_21' data-id='JN11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Master,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. </span>
<span class='v JN11_22' data-id='JN11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Even now, I know that God will grant you whatever you ask him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_23' data-id='JN11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Your brother will rise to life,”</span> said Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN11_24' data-id='JN11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“I know that he will,” replied Martha, “in the resurrection at the Last day.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_25' data-id='JN11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I am the resurrection and the life,”</span> said Jesus. <span class='wj'>“He who believes in me will live, though he die;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_26' data-id='JN11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and he who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_27' data-id='JN11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“Yes Master,” she answered; “I have learnt to believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_28' data-id='JN11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>After saying this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, and whispered, “The teacher is here, and is asking for you.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_29' data-id='JN11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As soon as Mary heard that, she got up quickly, and went to meet him. </span>
<span class='v JN11_30' data-id='JN11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus had not then come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met him. </span>
<span class='v JN11_31' data-id='JN11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So the people, who were in the house with Mary, comforting her, when they saw her get up quickly and go out, followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. </span>
<span class='v JN11_32' data-id='JN11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>When Mary came where Jesus was and saw him, she threw herself at his feet. “Master,” she exclaimed, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died!” </span>
<span class='v JN11_33' data-id='JN11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping also, he groaned deeply, and was greatly distressed. </span>
<span class='v JN11_34' data-id='JN11_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Where have you buried him?”</span> he asked. “Come and see, Master,” they answered. </span>
<span class='v JN11_35' data-id='JN11_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus burst into tears. </span>
<span class='v JN11_36' data-id='JN11_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“How he must have loved him!” the people exclaimed; </span>
<span class='v JN11_37' data-id='JN11_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>but some of them said, “Could not this man, who gave sight to the blind man, have also prevented Lazarus from dying?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_38' data-id='JN11_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Again groaning inwardly, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against the mouth of it. </span>
<span class='v JN11_39' data-id='JN11_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Move the stone away,”</span> said Jesus. “Master,” said Martha, the sister of the dead man, “by this time the smell must be offensive, for this is the fourth day since his death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_40' data-id='JN11_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Didn't I tell you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“that, if you would believe in me, you should see the glory of God?”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_41' data-id='JN11_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>So they moved the stone away; and Jesus, with uplifted eyes, said, <span class='wj'>“Father, I thank you that you have heard my prayer;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_42' data-id='JN11_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I know that you always hear me; but I say this for the sake of the people standing near, so that they may believe that you has sent me as your messenger.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_43' data-id='JN11_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then, after saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, <span class='wj'>“Lazarus! Come out!”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN11_44' data-id='JN11_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>The dead man came out, wrapped hand and foot in a winding-sheet; his face, too, had been wrapped in a cloth. <span class='wj'>“Set him free,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and let him go.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_45' data-id='JN11_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>In consequence of this, many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and had seen what Jesus did, learnt to believe in him. </span>
<span class='v JN11_46' data-id='JN11_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees, and told them what he had done. </span>
<span class='v JN11_47' data-id='JN11_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the High Council, and said, “What are we to do, now that this man is giving so many signs? </span>
<span class='v JN11_48' data-id='JN11_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>If we allow him to continue as we are doing, everyone will believe in him; and the Romans will come and will take from us both our city and our Nationality.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_49' data-id='JN11_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>One of them, however, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, </span>
<span class='v JN11_50' data-id='JN11_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>“You are utterly mistaken. You do not consider that it is better for you that one person should die for the people, rather than the whole nation should be destroyed.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_51' data-id='JN11_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Now he did not say this of his own accord; but, as high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation — </span>
<span class='v JN11_52' data-id='JN11_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And not for the nation only, but also that he might unite in one body the children of God now scattered far and wide. </span>
<span class='v JN11_53' data-id='JN11_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>So from that day they plotted to put Jesus to death. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_54' data-id='JN11_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>In consequence of this, Jesus did not go about publicly amongst the people any more, but left and went into the country bordering on the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, where he stayed with his disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN11_55' data-id='JN11_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>But the Jewish Festival of the Passover was near; and many people had gone up from the country to Jerusalem, for their purification, before the Festival began. </span>
<span class='v JN11_56' data-id='JN11_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>So they looked for Jesus there, and said to one another, as they stood in the Temple Courts, “What do you think? Do you think he will come to the Festival?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_57' data-id='JN11_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the Pharisees had already issued orders that, if anyone learnt where Jesus was, he should give information, so that they might arrest him. </span></div></div>
