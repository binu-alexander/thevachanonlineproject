<span class='v C112_1' data-id='C112_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the next place, friends, I do not want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts. </span>
<span class='v C112_2' data-id='C112_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You know that there was a time when you were Gentiles, going astray after idols that could not speak, just as you happened to be led. </span>
<span class='v C112_3' data-id='C112_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Therefore I tell you plainly that no one who speaks under the influence of the Spirit of God says ‘JESUS IS ACCURSED,’ and that no one can say ‘JESUS IS LORD,’ except under the influence of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v C112_4' data-id='C112_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Gifts differ, but the Spirit is the same; </span>
<span class='v C112_5' data-id='C112_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>ways of serving differ, yet the Master is the same; </span>
<span class='v C112_6' data-id='C112_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>results differ, yet the God who brings about every result is in every case the same. </span>
<span class='v C112_7' data-id='C112_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To each of us there is given spiritual illumination for the general good. </span>
<span class='v C112_8' data-id='C112_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>To one is given the power to speak with wisdom through the Spirit; to another the power to speak with knowledge, due to the same Spirit; </span>
<span class='v C112_9' data-id='C112_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>to another faith by the same Spirit; to another power to cure diseases by the one Spirit; to another supernatural powers; </span>
<span class='v C112_10' data-id='C112_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>to another the gift of preaching; to another the gift of distinguishing between true and false inspiration; to another varieties of the gift of ‘tongues’; to another the power to interpret ‘tongues.’ </span>
<span class='v C112_11' data-id='C112_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>All these result from one and the same Spirit, who distributes his gifts to each individually as he wills. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C112_12' data-id='C112_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For just as the human body is one whole, and yet has many parts, and all its parts, many though they are, form but one body, so it is with the Christ; </span>
<span class='v C112_13' data-id='C112_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>for it was by one Spirit that we were all baptised to form one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, and were all imbued with one Spirit. </span>
<span class='v C112_14' data-id='C112_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The human body, I repeat, consists not of one part, but of many. </span>
<span class='v C112_15' data-id='C112_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If the foot says ‘Since I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body. </span>
<span class='v C112_16' data-id='C112_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Or if the ear says ‘Since I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,’ it does not because of that cease to belong to the body. </span>
<span class='v C112_17' data-id='C112_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If all the body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If it were all hearing, where would the sense of smell be? </span>
<span class='v C112_18' data-id='C112_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But in fact God has placed each individual part just where he thought fit in the body. </span>
<span class='v C112_19' data-id='C112_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If, however, they all made up only one part, where would the body be? </span>
<span class='v C112_20' data-id='C112_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But in fact, although it has many parts, there is only one body. </span>
<span class='v C112_21' data-id='C112_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The eye cannot say to the hand ‘I do not need you,’ nor, again, the head to the feet ‘I do not need you.’ </span>
<span class='v C112_22' data-id='C112_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>No! Those parts of the body that seem naturally the weaker are indispensable; </span>
<span class='v C112_23' data-id='C112_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and those parts which we deem less honourable we surround with special honour; and our ungraceful parts receive a special grace which our graceful parts do not require. </span>
<span class='v C112_24' data-id='C112_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Yes, God has so constructed the body — by giving a special honour to the part that lacks it — </span>
<span class='v C112_25' data-id='C112_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As to secure that there should be no disunion in the body, but that the parts should show the same care for one another. </span>
<span class='v C112_26' data-id='C112_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>If one part suffers, all the others suffer with it, and if one part has honour done it, all the others share its joy. </span>
<span class='v C112_27' data-id='C112_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Together you are the body of Christ, and individually its parts. </span>
<span class='v C112_28' data-id='C112_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In the church God has appointed, first, apostles, secondly preachers, thirdly teachers; then he has given supernatural powers, then power to cure diseases, aptness for helping others, capacity to govern, varieties of the gift of ‘tongues.’ </span>
<span class='v C112_29' data-id='C112_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Can everyone be an apostle? Can everyone be a preacher? Can everyone be a teacher? Can everyone have supernatural powers? </span>
<span class='v C112_30' data-id='C112_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Can everyone have power to cure diseases? Can everyone speak in ‘tongues’? Can everyone interpret them? </span>
<span class='v C112_31' data-id='C112_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Strive for the greater gifts. </span></div>
