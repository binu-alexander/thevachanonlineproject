<span class='v RV12_4' data-id='RV12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>His tail draws after it a third of the stars in the heavens, and it hurled them down on the earth. The Dragon is standing in front of the woman who is about to give birth to the child, so that he may devour it as soon as it is born. </span>
<span class='v RV12_5' data-id='RV12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is destined to rule all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was at once caught up to God on his throne. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV12_7' data-id='RV12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then a battle took place in the heavens. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. But though the Dragon, with his angels, fought, </span>
<span class='v RV12_8' data-id='RV12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>he did not prevail; and there was no place left for them any longer in the heavens. </span>
<span class='v RV12_9' data-id='RV12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the great Dragon, the primeval snake, known as the ‘devil’ and ‘Satan,’ who deceives all the world, was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him. </span>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I heard a loud voice in heaven which said — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>‘Now has begun the day of the salvation, and Power, and Dominion of our God, and the Rule of his Christ; for the Accuser of our people has been hurled down, he who has been accusing them before our God day and night. </span>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Their victory was due to the blood of the Lamb, and to the message to which they bore their testimony. In their love of life they shrank not from death. </span>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, be glad, heaven, and all who live in heaven! Alas for the earth and for the sea, for the devil has gone down to you in great fury, knowing that he has but little time.’ </span></div>

<span class='v RV12_13' data-id='RV12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>when the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. </span>
<span class='v RV12_14' data-id='RV12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But to the woman were given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly to her place in the wilderness, where she is being tended for one year, and for two years, and for half a year in safety from the snake. </span>
<span class='v RV12_15' data-id='RV12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the snake poured water from its mouth after the woman, like a river, so that it might sweep her away. </span>
