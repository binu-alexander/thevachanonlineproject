<span class='v P13_1' data-id='P13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again, you married women should submit to your husbands, so that if any of them reject the message, they may, apart from the message, be won over, by the conduct of their wives, </span>
<span class='v P13_2' data-id='P13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>as they see your pure, reverent conduct. </span>
<span class='v P13_3' data-id='P13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yours should be, not the external adornment of the arrangement of the hair, the wearing of jewellery, or the putting on of dresses, </span>
<span class='v P13_4' data-id='P13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but the inner life with the imperishable beauty of a quiet and gentle spirit; for this is very precious in God's sight. </span>
<span class='v P13_5' data-id='P13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It was by this that the holy women of old, who rested their hopes on God, adorned themselves; submitting to their husbands, </span>
<span class='v P13_6' data-id='P13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>as Sarah did, who obeyed Abraham, and called him master. And you are her true children, as long as you live good lives, and let nothing terrify you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_7' data-id='P13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Again, those of you who are married men should live considerately with their wives, showing due regard to their sex, as physically weaker than their own, and not forgetting that they share with you in the gift of life. Then you will be able to pray without hindrance. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_8' data-id='P13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Lastly, you should all be united, sympathetic, full of love for each other, kind-hearted, humble-minded; </span>
<span class='v P13_9' data-id='P13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>never returning evil for evil, or abuse for abuse, but, on the contrary, blessing. It was to this that you were called — to obtain a blessing! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>‘The person who wants to enjoy life </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>And see happy days — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>They should keep their tongue from evil </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>And their lips from deceitful words, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_11' data-id='P13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>they should turn from evil and do good, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_11' data-id='P13_11'>They should seek for peace and follow after it; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'>And his ears are attentive to their prayers, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'>But the face of the Lord is set against those who do wrong.’ </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_13' data-id='P13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who, indeed, is there to harm you, if you prove yourselves to be eager for what is good? </span>
<span class='v P13_14' data-id='P13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Even if you should suffer for righteousness, count yourselves blessed! ‘Do not let people terrify you, or allow yourselves to be dismayed.’ </span>
<span class='v P13_15' data-id='P13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Revere the Christ as Lord in your hearts; always ready to give an answer to anyone who asks your reason for the hope that you cherish, but giving it with courtesy and respect, </span>
<span class='v P13_16' data-id='P13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and keeping your consciences clear, so that, whenever you are maligned, those who vilify your good and Christian conduct may be put to shame. </span>
<span class='v P13_17' data-id='P13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>It is better that you should suffer, if that should be God's will, for doing right, than for doing wrong. </span>
<span class='v P13_18' data-id='P13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For Christ himself died to atone for sins once for all — the good on behalf of the bad — that he might bring you to God; his body being put to death, but his spirit entering on new life. </span>
<span class='v P13_19' data-id='P13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And it was then that he went and preached to the imprisoned spirits, </span>
<span class='v P13_20' data-id='P13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>who once were disobedient, at the time when God patiently waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared; in which some few lives, eight in all, were saved by means of water. </span>
<span class='v P13_21' data-id='P13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And baptism, which this foreshadowed, now saves you — not the mere cleansing of the body, but the search of a clear conscience after God — through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v P13_22' data-id='P13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>who has gone into heaven, and is at God's right hand, where angels and archangels and the powers of heaven now yield submission to him. </span></div></div>
