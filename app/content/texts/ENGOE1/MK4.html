<span class='v MK4_1' data-id='MK4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus again began to teach by the sea; and, as an immense crowd was gathering around him, he got into a boat, and sat in it on the sea, while all the people were on the shore at the water's edge. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_2' data-id='MK4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then he taught them many truths in parables; and in the course of his teaching he said to them: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_3' data-id='MK4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Listen! The sower went out to sow;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_4' data-id='MK4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and presently, as he was sowing, some of the seed fell along the path; and the birds came, and ate it up.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_5' data-id='MK4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Some fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and, because the soil wasn't deep, sprang up at once;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_6' data-id='MK4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, when the sun rose, it was scorched, and, because their roots were not deep enough, withered away.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_7' data-id='MK4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Some of the seed fell amongst brambles; but the brambles shot up and completely choked it, and it yielded no return.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_8' data-id='MK4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Some fell into good soil, and, shooting up and growing, yielded a return, amounting to thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_9' data-id='MK4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Let anyone who has ears to hear with hear.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_10' data-id='MK4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Afterward, when he was alone, his followers and the Twelve asked him about his parables; </span>
<span class='v MK4_11' data-id='MK4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and he said, <span class='wj'>“To you the hidden truth of the kingdom of God has been imparted; but to those who are outside it all teaching takes the form of parables so that —</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_12' data-id='MK4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Though they have eyes, they may see without perceiving; and though they have ears, they may hear without understanding; otherwise some day they might turn and be forgiven.’ ”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_13' data-id='MK4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“You do not know the meaning of this parable?”</span> he went on; <span class='wj'>“Then how will you understand all the other parables?</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_14' data-id='MK4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The sower sows the message.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_15' data-id='MK4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The people meant by the seed that falls along the path are these — where the message is sown, but, as soon as they have heard it, Satan immediately comes and carries away the message that has been sown in them.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_16' data-id='MK4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, too, those meant by the seed sown on the rocky places are the people who, when they have heard the message, at once accept it joyfully;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_17' data-id='MK4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, as they have no root, they stand only for a short time; and so, when trouble or persecution arises because of the message, they fall away at once.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_18' data-id='MK4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Those meant by the seed sown amongst the brambles are different; they are the people who hear the message,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_19' data-id='MK4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but the cares of life, and the glamour of wealth, and cravings for many other things come in and completely choke the message, so that it gives no return.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_20' data-id='MK4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the people meant by the seed sown on the good ground are those who hear the message, and welcome it, and yield a return, thirty, sixty, and even a hundred fold.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_21' data-id='MK4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the couch, instead of being put on the lamp-stand?</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_22' data-id='MK4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>There is nothing hidden that will not come to light and nothing is concealed that will not be brought into the open.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_23' data-id='MK4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Let all who have ears to hear with hear.</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_24' data-id='MK4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Take care what you listen to,”</span> said Jesus. <span class='wj'>“The standard you use will be used for you, and more will be added for you.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_25' data-id='MK4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, to those who have, more will be given; while, from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_26' data-id='MK4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus also said, <span class='wj'>“This is what the kingdom of God is like — like a man who has scattered seed on the ground,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_27' data-id='MK4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and then sleeps by night and rises by day, while the seed is shooting up and growing — he knows not how.</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_28' data-id='MK4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The ground bears the crop of itself — first the blade, then the ear, and then the full grain in the ear;</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_29' data-id='MK4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but, as soon as the crop is ready, immediately he puts in the sickle because harvest has come.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_30' data-id='MK4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus also said, <span class='wj'>“To what can we liken the kingdom of God?</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_31' data-id='MK4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>By what can we illustrate it? Perhaps by the growth of a mustard seed. This seed, when sown in the ground, though it is smaller than all other seeds,</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_32' data-id='MK4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>yet, when sown, shoots up, and becomes larger than any other herb, and puts out great branches, so that even the wild birds can roost in its shelter.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_33' data-id='MK4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>With many such parables Jesus used to speak to the people of his message, as far as they were able to receive it; </span>
<span class='v MK4_34' data-id='MK4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>and to them he never used to speak except in parables; but in private to his own disciples he explained everything. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK4_35' data-id='MK4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>In the evening of the same day, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Let us go across.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_36' data-id='MK4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>So, leaving the crowd behind, they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat; and there were other boats with him. </span>
<span class='v MK4_37' data-id='MK4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>A violent squall came on, and the waves kept dashing into the boat, so that the boat was actually filling. </span>
<span class='v MK4_38' data-id='MK4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Jesus was in the stern asleep on the cushion; and the disciples roused him and cried, “Teacher! Is it nothing to you that we are lost?” </span>
<span class='v MK4_39' data-id='MK4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, <span class='wj'>“Hush! Be still!”</span> Then the wind dropped, and a great calm followed. </span>
<span class='v MK4_40' data-id='MK4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Why are you so timid?”</span> he exclaimed. <span class='wj'>“Have you no faith yet?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MK4_41' data-id='MK4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>But they were struck with great awe, and said to one another, “Who can this be that even the wind and the sea obey him?” </span></div></div>
