<span class='v AC22_1' data-id='AC22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defence which I am about to make.” </span>
<span class='v AC22_2' data-id='AC22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When they heard that he was speaking to them in Hebrew, they were still more quiet; and Paul went on: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_3' data-id='AC22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, but I was brought up in this city under the teaching of Gamaliel, and educated in accordance with the strict system of our ancestral Law. I was as zealous in God's service as any of you who are here today. </span>
<span class='v AC22_4' data-id='AC22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In my persecution of this Way I did not stop even at the taking of life. I put in chains, and imprisoned, men and women alike — </span>
<span class='v AC22_5' data-id='AC22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And to that the high priest himself and all the council of elders can testify. For I had letters of introduction from them to our fellow Jews at Damascus, and I was on my way to that place, to bring those whom I might find there prisoners to Jerusalem for punishment. </span>
<span class='v AC22_6' data-id='AC22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>While I was still on my way, just as I was getting close to Damascus, about midday, suddenly there flashed from the heavens a great light all around me. </span>
<span class='v AC22_7' data-id='AC22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me <span class='wj'>‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’</span> </span>
<span class='v AC22_8' data-id='AC22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>‘Who are you, Lord?’ I replied. Then the voice said <span class='wj'>‘I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting.’</span> </span>
<span class='v AC22_9' data-id='AC22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The men with me saw the light, but did not hear the speaker's voice. </span>
<span class='v AC22_10' data-id='AC22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then I said ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ <span class='wj'>‘Get up and go into Damascus,’</span> The Lord said to me, <span class='wj'>‘and there you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’</span> </span>
<span class='v AC22_11' data-id='AC22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In consequence of that dazzling light I could not see, but my companions held me by the hand, until I reached Damascus. </span>
<span class='v AC22_12' data-id='AC22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>There a man named Ananias, a strict observer of our Law, well spoken of by all the Jewish inhabitants, came to see me. </span>
<span class='v AC22_13' data-id='AC22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Standing close to me, he said ‘Saul, my brother, recover your sight.’ And then and there I recovered my sight and looked up at him. </span>
<span class='v AC22_14' data-id='AC22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he said ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to learn his will, and to see the righteous one, and to hear words from his lips; </span>
<span class='v AC22_15' data-id='AC22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>for you will be a witness for him to all the world of what you have just seen and heard. </span>
<span class='v AC22_16' data-id='AC22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And now why wait any longer, Be baptised at once, wash away your sins, and invoke his name.’ </span>
<span class='v AC22_17' data-id='AC22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>After my return to Jerusalem, while I was praying one day in the Temple, I fell into a trance, </span>
<span class='v AC22_18' data-id='AC22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and saw Jesus saying to me <span class='wj'>‘Make haste and leave Jerusalem at once, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’</span> </span>
<span class='v AC22_19' data-id='AC22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘these people know that I used to imprison and scourge, in synagogue after synagogue, those who believed in you; </span>
<span class='v AC22_20' data-id='AC22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and, when the blood of your martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I was myself standing by, approving of his death, and took charge of the clothes of those who were murdering him.’ </span>
<span class='v AC22_21' data-id='AC22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to me <span class='wj'>‘Go; for I will send you to the Gentiles far away’.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_22' data-id='AC22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Up to this point the people had been listening to Paul, but at these words they called out, “Kill him! A fellow like this ought not to have been allowed to live!” </span>
<span class='v AC22_23' data-id='AC22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As they were shouting, tearing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air, </span>
<span class='v AC22_24' data-id='AC22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>the commanding officer ordered Paul to be taken into the Fort, and directed that he should be examined under the lash so that he might find out the reason for their outcry against him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_25' data-id='AC22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But just as they had tied him up to be scourged, Paul said to the captain standing near, “Is it legal for you to scourge a Roman citizen, unconvicted?” </span>
<span class='v AC22_26' data-id='AC22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, the captain went and reported it to the commanding officer. “Do you know what you are doing?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.” </span>
<span class='v AC22_27' data-id='AC22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So the commanding officer went up to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_27' data-id='AC22_27'>“Yes,” replied Paul. </span>
<span class='v AC22_28' data-id='AC22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“I had to pay a heavy price for my position as citizen,” said the officer. “I am one by birth,” rejoined Paul. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_29' data-id='AC22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The men who were to have examined Paul immediately drew back, and the officer, finding that Paul was a Roman citizen, was alarmed at having put him in chains. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC22_30' data-id='AC22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>On the next day the commanding officer, wishing to find out the real reason why Paul was denounced by the Jewish leaders, had his chains taken off, and directed the chief priests and the whole of the High Council to assemble, and then took Paul down and brought him before them. </span></div></div>
