<div class='s'>The Flying Scroll </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC5_1' data-id='ZC5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then again I looked up and saw a flying scroll. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_2' data-id='ZC5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll; twenty cubits long, ten cubits wide.” </span>
<span class='v ZC5_3' data-id='ZC5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes over the whole land. Every thief will be banished according to the writing on one side and everyone who lies under oath shall be banished according to the writing on the other side. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_4' data-id='ZC5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I have sent it out, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of anyone who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in the midst of his house and will consume it with its timber and its stones.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC5_5' data-id='ZC5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the messenger who talked with me came forward, and said to me, “Look up and see what is now coming.” </span>
<span class='v ZC5_6' data-id='ZC5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I said. “What is it?” He said, “It is a measuring basket, full of the guilt of the land.” </span>
<span class='v ZC5_7' data-id='ZC5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A round leaden cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting in the middle of the basket. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_8' data-id='ZC5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said, “This is Wickedness.” He thrust her down into the midst of the basket and he pushed the round leaden cover back on its mouth. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_9' data-id='ZC5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then I looked up and saw two women, and the wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the basket between them. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_10' data-id='ZC5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?” </span>
<span class='v ZC5_11' data-id='ZC5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “To build her a house in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, they will rest the basket there.” </span></div></div>
