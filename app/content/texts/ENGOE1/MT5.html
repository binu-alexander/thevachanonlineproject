<span class='v MT5_29' data-id='MT5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If your right eye causes you to sin, take it out and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it thrown into Gehenna.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_30' data-id='MT5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It would be best for you to lose one part of your body, and not to have the whole of it go down to Gehenna.</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT5_32' data-id='MT5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of some serious sexual sin, leads to her committing adultery; while anyone who marries her after her divorce is guilty of adultery.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_33' data-id='MT5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Again, you have heard that our ancestors were told — ‘Do not break your oaths, keep your vows to the Lord.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_34' data-id='MT5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I say to you that you must not swear at all, either by heaven, since that is God's throne,</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_35' data-id='MT5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>or by the earth, since that is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, since that is the city of the Great King.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_36' data-id='MT5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Nor should you swear by your head, since you cannot make a single hair either white or black.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_37' data-id='MT5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Let your words be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything beyond this comes from what is evil.</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT5_44' data-id='MT5_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But what I tell you is this: love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_45' data-id='MT5_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>so that you may become children of your Father who is in heaven; for he causes his sun to rise on bad and good alike, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_46' data-id='MT5_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, if you love only those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax-gatherers do this!</span> </span>
<span class='v MT5_47' data-id='MT5_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, if you only welcome your brothers and sisters, what are you doing more than others? Even the Gentiles do this!</span> </span>
