<span class='v MT25_1' data-id='MT25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten bridesmaids who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_2' data-id='MT25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_3' data-id='MT25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The foolish ones took their lamps, but took no oil with them;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_4' data-id='MT25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>while the prudent ones, besides taking their lamps, took oil in their jars.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_5' data-id='MT25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As the groom was late in coming, they all became drowsy, and slept.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_6' data-id='MT25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But at midnight a shout was raised — ‘The groom is coming! Come out to meet him!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_7' data-id='MT25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then all the bridesmaids woke up and trimmed their lamps,</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_8' data-id='MT25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and the foolish said to the prudent ‘Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_9' data-id='MT25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the prudent ones answered ‘No, There may not be enough for you and for us. Go instead to those who sell it, and buy for yourselves.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_10' data-id='MT25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But while they were on their way to buy it, the groom came; and the bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the banquet, and the door was shut.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_11' data-id='MT25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Afterward the other bridesmaids came. ‘Sir, Sir,’ they said, ‘open the door to us!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_12' data-id='MT25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the groom answered ‘I tell you, I do not know you.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_13' data-id='MT25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore watch, since you know neither the day nor the hour.</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT25_14' data-id='MT25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“For it is as though a man, going on his travels, called his servants, and gave his property into their charge.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_15' data-id='MT25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He gave five bags of gold to one, two to another, and one bag to a third, in proportion to the ability of each. Then he set out on his travels.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_16' data-id='MT25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The servant who had received the five bags of gold went at once and traded with it, and made another five bags.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_17' data-id='MT25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, too, the servant who had received the two bags of gold made another two bags.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_18' data-id='MT25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the servant who had received the one bag went and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_19' data-id='MT25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>After a long time the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_20' data-id='MT25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The servant who had received the five bags of gold came up and brought five bags more. ‘Sir,’ he said, ‘you entrusted me with five bags of gold; look, I have made another five bags!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_21' data-id='MT25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master's joy!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_22' data-id='MT25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then the one who had received the two bags of gold came up and said ‘Sir, you entrusted me with two bags pounds; look, I have made another two!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_23' data-id='MT25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Well done, good, trustworthy servant!’ said his master. ‘You have been trustworthy with a small sum; now I will place a large one in your hands; come and share your master's joy!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_24' data-id='MT25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The man who had received the single bag of gold came up, too, and said ‘Sir, I knew that you were a hard man; you reap where you have not sown, and gather up where you have not winnowed;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_25' data-id='MT25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and, in my fear, I went and hid your money in the ground; look, here is what belongs to you!’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_26' data-id='MT25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘You lazy, worthless servant!’ was his master's reply. ‘You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather up where I have not winnowed?</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_27' data-id='MT25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then you ought to have placed my money in the hands of bankers, and I, on my return, should have received my money, with interest.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_28' data-id='MT25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Therefore,’ he continued, ‘take away from him the one bag of gold, and give it to the one who has the ten bags.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_29' data-id='MT25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, to him who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but, as for him who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_30' data-id='MT25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>As for the useless servant, put him out into the darkness outside, where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth.’</span> </span></div>

<span class='v MT25_34' data-id='MT25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then the king will say to those on his right ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, enter into possession of the kingdom prepared for you ever since the beginning of the world.</span> </span>

<span class='v MT25_40' data-id='MT25_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And the king will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you did it to one of these my brothers or sisters, however unimportant they seemed, you did it to me.’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_41' data-id='MT25_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then he will say to those on his left ‘Go from my presence, accursed, into the permanent fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_42' data-id='MT25_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For, when I was hungry, you gave me no food; when I was thirsty, you gave me no drink;</span> </span>

<span class='v MT25_44' data-id='MT25_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Then they, in their turn, will answer ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and did not supply your wants?’</span> </span>
<span class='v MT25_45' data-id='MT25_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And then he will reply ‘I tell you, as often as you failed to do it to one of these, however unimportant, you failed to do it to me.’</span> </span>
