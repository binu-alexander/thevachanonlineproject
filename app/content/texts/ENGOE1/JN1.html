<div class='s'>The Preparation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_19' data-id='JN1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John — “Who are you?”, </span>
<span class='v JN1_20' data-id='JN1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>he told them clearly and simply, “I am not the Christ.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“What then?” they asked. “Are you Elijah?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'>“No,” he said, “I am not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'>“Are you ‘the prophet’?” He answered, “No.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_22' data-id='JN1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Who then are you?” they continued; “tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_23' data-id='JN1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“I,” he answered, “am — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN1_23' data-id='JN1_23'>‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: make a straight road for the Lord’, </span></div>

<span class='v JN1_23' data-id='JN1_23'></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN1_23' data-id='JN1_23'>as the prophet Isaiah said.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_24' data-id='JN1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>These men had been sent from the Pharisees; </span>
<span class='v JN1_25' data-id='JN1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and their next question was, “Why then do you baptise, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or ‘the prophet’?” </span>
<span class='v JN1_26' data-id='JN1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>John's answer was — “I baptise with water, but amongst you stands one whom you do not know; </span>
<span class='v JN1_27' data-id='JN1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.” </span>
<span class='v JN1_28' data-id='JN1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_29' data-id='JN1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed, “Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! </span>
<span class='v JN1_30' data-id='JN1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I was taking about him when I said ‘After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.’ </span>
<span class='v JN1_31' data-id='JN1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>I did not know who he was, but I have come baptising with water to make him known to Israel.” </span>
<span class='v JN1_32' data-id='JN1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>John also said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_32' data-id='JN1_32'>“I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. </span>
<span class='v JN1_33' data-id='JN1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him — he it is who baptises with the Holy Spirit.’ </span>
<span class='v JN1_34' data-id='JN1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_35' data-id='JN1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, </span>
<span class='v JN1_36' data-id='JN1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed, “There is the Lamb of God!” </span>
<span class='v JN1_37' data-id='JN1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN1_38' data-id='JN1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned around, and saw them following. <span class='wj'>“What are you looking for?”</span> he asked. “Rabbi,” they answered (or, as we should say, ‘Teacher’), “where are you staying?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_39' data-id='JN1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Come, and you will see,”</span> he replied. So they went, and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_39' data-id='JN1_39'>It was then about four in the afternoon. </span>
<span class='v JN1_40' data-id='JN1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>One of the two, who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. </span>
<span class='v JN1_41' data-id='JN1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (a word which means ‘Christ,’ or ‘Consecrated’.) </span>
<span class='v JN1_42' data-id='JN1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Then he brought him to Jesus. Looking straight at him, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“You are Simon, the son of John; you will be called Cephas”</span> (which means ‘Peter,’ or ‘Rock’). </span>
<span class='v JN1_43' data-id='JN1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>The following day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. He found Philip, and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Follow me.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN1_44' data-id='JN1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter. </span>
<span class='v JN1_45' data-id='JN1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>He found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and of whom the prophets also wrote — Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph's son!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_46' data-id='JN1_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” asked Nathanael. “Come and see,” replied Philip. </span>
<span class='v JN1_47' data-id='JN1_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he said, <span class='wj'>“Here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_48' data-id='JN1_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>“How do you know me?” asked Nathanael. <span class='wj'>“Even before Philip called you,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_49' data-id='JN1_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>“Rabbi,” Nathanael exclaimed, “you are the Son of God, you are king of Israel!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_50' data-id='JN1_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Do you believe in me,”</span> asked Jesus, <span class='wj'>“because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than those!</span> </span>
<span class='v JN1_51' data-id='JN1_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In truth I tell you,”</span> he added, <span class='wj'>“you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”</span> </span></div></div>
