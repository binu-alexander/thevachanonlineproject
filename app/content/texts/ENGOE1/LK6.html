<span class='v LK6_1' data-id='LK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One Sabbath Jesus was walking through cornfields, and his disciples were picking the ears of wheat, and rubbing them in their hands, and eating them. </span>
<span class='v LK6_2' data-id='LK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Why are you doing what it is not allowable to do on the Sabbath?” asked some of the Pharisees. </span>
<span class='v LK6_3' data-id='LK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus' answer was, <span class='wj'>“Haven't you read even of what David did, when he was hungry, he and his companions —</span> </span>
<span class='v LK6_4' data-id='LK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>That he went into the house of God, and took the consecrated bread and ate it, and gave some to his companions, though only the priests are allowed to eat it?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK6_5' data-id='LK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus added, <span class='wj'>“The Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_6' data-id='LK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On another Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there whose right hand was withered. </span>
<span class='v LK6_7' data-id='LK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely, to see if he would work cures on the Sabbath, so that they might find a charge to bring against him. </span>
<span class='v LK6_8' data-id='LK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus, however, knew what was in the their minds, and said to the man whose hand was withered, <span class='wj'>“Stand up and come out into the middle.”</span> The man stood up; </span>
<span class='v LK6_9' data-id='LK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I ask you, is it allowable to do good on the Sabbath — or harm? To save a life, or let it perish?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK6_10' data-id='LK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then, looking around at them all, he said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> The man did so; and his hand had become sound. </span>
<span class='v LK6_11' data-id='LK6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the teachers of the Law and the Pharisees were mad with rage, and consulted together what they could do to Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_12' data-id='LK6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now about that time, Jesus went out, up the hill, to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God. </span>
<span class='v LK6_13' data-id='LK6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When day came, he summoned his disciples, and chose twelve of them, whom he also named ‘apostles.’ </span>
<span class='v LK6_14' data-id='LK6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They were Simon (whom Jesus also named Peter), and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, </span>
<span class='v LK6_15' data-id='LK6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot, </span>
<span class='v LK6_16' data-id='LK6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor. </span>
<span class='v LK6_17' data-id='LK6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus came down the hill with them and took his stand on a level place. With him were a large crowd of his disciples, and great numbers of people from the whole of Judea, Jerusalem, and the coast district of Tyre and Sidon, </span>
<span class='v LK6_18' data-id='LK6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>who had come to hear him and to be restored to health. Those, too, who were troubled with foul spirits were cured; </span>
<span class='v LK6_19' data-id='LK6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him, because a power went out from him which restored them all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_20' data-id='LK6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then, raising his eyes and looking at his disciples, Jesus said: </span></div>
