<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB5_1' data-id='HB5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Every high priest, taken from amongst the people, is appointed as their representative in their relations with God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices in expiation of sins. </span>
<span class='v HB5_2' data-id='HB5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he is able to sympathise with the ignorant and deluded, since he is himself subject to weakness, </span>
<span class='v HB5_3' data-id='HB5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and is therefore bound to offer sacrifices for sins, not only for the people, but equally so for himself. </span>
<span class='v HB5_4' data-id='HB5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Nor does anyone take that high office on themselves, until they have been called to do so by God, as Aaron was. </span>
<span class='v HB5_5' data-id='HB5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the same way, even the Christ did not take the honour of the high priesthood on himself, but he was appointed by him who said to him — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB5_5' data-id='HB5_5'>‘You are my Son; this day I have become your Father’; </span></div>

<span class='v HB5_6' data-id='HB5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and on another occasion also — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB5_6' data-id='HB5_6'>‘You are a priest for all time of the order of Melchizedek.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB5_7' data-id='HB5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus, in the days of his earthly life, offered prayers and supplications, with earnest cries and with tears, to him who was able to save him from death; and he was heard because of his devout submission. </span>
<span class='v HB5_8' data-id='HB5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Son though he was, he learnt obedience from his sufferings; </span>
<span class='v HB5_9' data-id='HB5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and, being made perfect, he became to all those who obey him the source of eternal salvation, </span>
<span class='v HB5_10' data-id='HB5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>while God himself pronounced him a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB5_11' data-id='HB5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now on this subject I have much to say, but it is difficult to explain it to you, because you have shown yourselves so slow to learn. </span>
<span class='v HB5_12' data-id='HB5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For whereas, considering the time that has elapsed, you ought to be teaching others, you still need someone to teach you the alphabet of the divine revelation, and need again to be fed with milk instead of with ‘solid food.’ </span>
<span class='v HB5_13' data-id='HB5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For everyone who still has to take milk knows nothing of the teaching of righteousness; they are a mere infant. </span>
<span class='v HB5_14' data-id='HB5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But solid food is for Christians of mature faith — those whose faculties have been trained by practise to distinguish right from wrong. </span></div></div>
