<span class='v JN10_1' data-id='JN10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In truth I tell you, whoever does not go into the sheepfold through the door, but climbs up at some other place, that person is a thief and a robber;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_2' data-id='JN10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but the person who goes in through the door is shepherd to the sheep.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_3' data-id='JN10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For him the watchman opens the door; and the sheep listen to his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_4' data-id='JN10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When he has brought them all out, he walks in front of them, and his sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_5' data-id='JN10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They will not follow a stranger, but will run away from him; because they do not know a stranger's voice.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_6' data-id='JN10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>This was the allegory that Jesus told them, but they did not understand of what he was speaking. </span>
<span class='v JN10_7' data-id='JN10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So he continued, <span class='wj'>“In truth I tell you, I am the door for the sheep.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_8' data-id='JN10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>All who came before me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_9' data-id='JN10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am the door; he who goes in through me will be safe, and he will go in and out and find pasture.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_10' data-id='JN10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The thief comes only to steal, to kill, and to destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it in greater fullness.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_11' data-id='JN10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_12' data-id='JN10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The hired man who is not a shepherd, and who does not own the sheep, when he sees a wolf coming, leaves them and runs away; then the wolf seizes them, and scatters the flock.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_13' data-id='JN10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He does this because he is only a hired man and does not care about the sheep.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_14' data-id='JN10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am the good shepherd; and I know my sheep, and my sheep know me —</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_15' data-id='JN10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Just as the Father knows me and I know the Father — and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_16' data-id='JN10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have other sheep besides, which do not belong to this fold; I must lead them also, and they will listen to my voice; and they will become one flock under one shepherd.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_17' data-id='JN10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life — to receive it again.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_18' data-id='JN10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No one took it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to receive it again. This is the command which I received from my Father.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_19' data-id='JN10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In consequence of these words a difference of opinion again arose amongst the people. </span>
<span class='v JN10_20' data-id='JN10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Many of them said, “He is possessed by a demon and is mad; why do you listen to him?” </span>
<span class='v JN10_21' data-id='JN10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Others said, “This is not the teaching of one who is possessed by a demon. Can a demon give sight to the blind?” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_22' data-id='JN10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Soon after this the Festival of the Rededication was held at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JN10_23' data-id='JN10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>It was winter; and Jesus was walking in the Temple Courts, in the Colonnade of Solomon, </span>
<span class='v JN10_24' data-id='JN10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>when the people gathered around him, and said, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so frankly.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_25' data-id='JN10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“I have told you so,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and you do not believe me. The work that I am doing in my Father's name bears testimony to me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_26' data-id='JN10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But you do not believe me, because you are not of my flock.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_27' data-id='JN10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_28' data-id='JN10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and I give them eternal life, and they will not be lost; nor will anyone snatch them out of my hands.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_29' data-id='JN10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>What my Father has entrusted to me is more than all else; and no one can snatch anything out of the Father's hands.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_30' data-id='JN10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The Father and I are one.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_31' data-id='JN10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Some of the people again brought stones to throw at him; </span>
<span class='v JN10_32' data-id='JN10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>and seeing this, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I have done before your eyes many good actions, inspired by the Father; for which of them would you stone me?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_33' data-id='JN10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“It is not for any good action that we would stone you,” they answered, “but for blasphemy; and because you, who are only a man, make yourself out to be God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_34' data-id='JN10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Are there not,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“these words in your Law — ‘I said, You are gods’?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_35' data-id='JN10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If those to whom God's word were addressed were said to be ‘gods’ — and scripture cannot be set aside —</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_36' data-id='JN10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>do you say of one whom the Father has consecrated and sent as his messenger to the world ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said ‘I am God's Son’?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_37' data-id='JN10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If I am not doing the work that my Father is doing, do not believe me;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_38' data-id='JN10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>if I am doing it, even though you do not believe me, believe what that work shows; so that you may understand, and understand more and more clearly, that the Father is in union with me, and I with the Father.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN10_39' data-id='JN10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>The authorities again sought to arrest him; but he escaped their hands. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_40' data-id='JN10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus again crossed the Jordan to the place where John used to baptise at first, and stayed there some time, during which many people came to see him. </span>
<span class='v JN10_41' data-id='JN10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>“John gave no sign of his mission,” they said; “but everything that he said about this man was true.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_42' data-id='JN10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And many learnt to believe in Jesus there. </span></div></div>
