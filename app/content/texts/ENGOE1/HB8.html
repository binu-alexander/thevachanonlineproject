<span class='v HB8_1' data-id='HB8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>To sum up what I have been saying: Such is the high priest that we have, one who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God's Majesty in heaven, </span>
<span class='v HB8_2' data-id='HB8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>where he serves in the sanctuary, in that true tent set up by the Lord and not by man. </span>
<span class='v HB8_3' data-id='HB8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Every high priest is appointed for the purpose of offering gifts and sacrifices to God; it follows, therefore, that this high priest must have some offering to make. </span>
<span class='v HB8_4' data-id='HB8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If he were, however, still on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts as the Law directs. </span>
<span class='v HB8_5' data-id='HB8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>(These priests, it is true, are engaged in a service which is only a copy and shadow of the heavenly realities, as is shown by the directions given to Moses when he was about to construct the tent. ‘Look to it,’ are the words, ‘that you make every part in accordance with the pattern shown you on the mountain.’) </span>
<span class='v HB8_6' data-id='HB8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, as we see, has obtained a ministry as far excelling theirs, as the covenant of which he is the intermediary, based, as it is, on better promises, excels the former covenant. </span>
<span class='v HB8_7' data-id='HB8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second. </span>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But, finding fault with the people, God says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'>‘ “A time is coming,” says the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'>“When I will ratify a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Not such a covenant as I made with their ancestors </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>For they did not abide by their covenant with me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>And therefore I disregarded them,” says the Lord. </span></div>

<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>After those days,” says the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>“I will impress my laws on their minds, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='q'>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>And they will be my people. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There will be no need for anyone to instruct their fellow citizen, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>Or for a person to say to their relatives ‘Learn to know the Lord’; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>For everyone will know me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>From the lowest to the highest. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_12' data-id='HB8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful to their wrong-doings, </span></div>

<span class='v HB8_12' data-id='HB8_12'>And I will no longer remember their sins.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB8_13' data-id='HB8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>By speaking of a new covenant, God at once renders the former covenant obsolete; and whatever becomes obsolete and loses its force is virtually annulled. </span></div></div>
