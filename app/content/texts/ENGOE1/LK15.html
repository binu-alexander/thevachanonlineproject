<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_1' data-id='LK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The tax-gatherers and the outcasts were all drawing near to Jesus to listen to him; </span>
<span class='v LK15_2' data-id='LK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but the Pharisees and the teachers of the Law found fault. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_2' data-id='LK15_2'>“This man always welcomes outcasts, and takes meals with them!” they complained. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_3' data-id='LK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Jesus told them this parable — </span>
<span class='v LK15_4' data-id='LK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Who amongst you who has a hundred sheep, and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine out in the open country, and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_5' data-id='LK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, when he has found it, he puts in on his shoulders rejoicing;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_6' data-id='LK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and, on reaching home, he calls his friends and his neighbours together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_7' data-id='LK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one outcast who repents, than over ninety-nine religious people, who have no need to repent.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_8' data-id='LK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Or again, what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_9' data-id='LK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, and says ‘Come and rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_10' data-id='LK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of God's angels over one outcast who repents.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_11' data-id='LK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus continued, <span class='wj'>“A man had two sons;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_12' data-id='LK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and the younger of them said to his father ‘Father, give me my share of the inheritance.’ So the father divided the property between them.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_13' data-id='LK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A few days later the younger son got together all that he had, and went away into a distant land; and there he squandered his inheritance by leading a dissolute life.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_14' data-id='LK15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>After he has spent all that he had, there was a severe famine through all that country, and he began to be in actual want.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_15' data-id='LK15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So he went and engaged himself to one of the people of that country, who sent him into his fields to tend pigs.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_16' data-id='LK15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He even longed to satisfy his hunger with the bean-pods on which the pigs were feeding; and no one gave him anything.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_17' data-id='LK15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, when he came to himself, he said ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more bread than they can eat, while here am I starving to death!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_18' data-id='LK15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I will get up and go to my father, and say to him “Father, I sinned against heaven and against you;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_19' data-id='LK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.” ’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_20' data-id='LK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And he got up and went to his father. But, while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was deeply moved; he ran and threw his arms around his neck and kissed him.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_21' data-id='LK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Father,’ the son said, ‘I sinned against heaven and against you; I am no longer fit to be called your son; make me one of your hired servants.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_22' data-id='LK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But the father turned to his servants and said ‘Be quick and fetch a robe — the very best — and put it on him; give him a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_23' data-id='LK15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_24' data-id='LK15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for here is my son who was dead, and is alive again, was lost, and is found.’ So they began making merry.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_25' data-id='LK15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Meanwhile the elder son was out in the fields; but, on coming home, when he got near the house, he heard music and dancing,</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_26' data-id='LK15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and he called one of the servants and asked what it all meant.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_27' data-id='LK15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Your brother has come back,’ the servant told him, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has him back safe and sound.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_28' data-id='LK15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This made him angry, and he would not go in. But his father came out and begged him to do so.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_29' data-id='LK15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘No,’ he said to his father, ‘look at all the years I have been serving you, without ever once disobeying you, and yet you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might have a merrymaking with my friends.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_30' data-id='LK15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But, no sooner has this son of yours come, who has eaten up your property in the company of prostitutes, than you have killed the fattened calf for him.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_31' data-id='LK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>‘Child,’ the father answered, ‘you are always with me, and everything that I have is yours.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK15_32' data-id='LK15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>We could but make merry and rejoice, for here is your brother who was dead, and is alive; who was lost, and is found.’ ”</span> </span></div></div>
