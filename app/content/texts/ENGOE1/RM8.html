<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_1' data-id='RM8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>There is, therefore, now no condemnation for those who are in union with Christ Jesus; </span>
<span class='v RM8_2' data-id='RM8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for through your union with Christ Jesus, the Law of the life-giving Spirit has set you free from the Law of sin and death. </span>
<span class='v RM8_3' data-id='RM8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>What Law could not do, in so far as our earthly nature weakened its action, God did, by sending his own Son, with a nature resembling our sinful nature, to atone for sin. He condemned sin in that earthly nature, </span>
<span class='v RM8_4' data-id='RM8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>so that the requirements of the Law might be satisfied in us who live now in obedience, not to our earthly nature, but to the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v RM8_5' data-id='RM8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They who follow their earthly nature are earthly-minded, while they who follow the Spirit are spiritually minded. </span>
<span class='v RM8_6' data-id='RM8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>To be earthly-minded means death, to be spiritually minded means life and peace; </span>
<span class='v RM8_7' data-id='RM8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>because to be earthly-minded is to be an enemy to God, for such a mind does not submit to the Law of God, nor indeed can it do so. </span>
<span class='v RM8_8' data-id='RM8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They who are earthly cannot please God. </span>
<span class='v RM8_9' data-id='RM8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You, however, are not earthly but spiritual, since the Spirit of God lives within you. Unless a person has the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ; </span>
<span class='v RM8_10' data-id='RM8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but, if Christ is within you, then, though the body is dead as a consequence of sin, the spirit is life as a consequence of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM8_11' data-id='RM8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And, if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives within you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life even to your mortal bodies, through his Spirit living within you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_12' data-id='RM8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So then, friends, we owe nothing to our earthly nature, that we should live in obedience to it. </span>
<span class='v RM8_13' data-id='RM8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If you live in obedience to your earthly nature, you will inevitably die; but if, by the power of the Spirit, you put an end to the evil habits of the body, you will live. </span>
<span class='v RM8_14' data-id='RM8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>All who are guided by the Spirit of God are sons of God. </span>
<span class='v RM8_15' data-id='RM8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For you did not receive the spirit of a slave, to fill you once more with fear, but the spirit of a son which leads us to cry ‘Abba, Our Father.’ </span>
<span class='v RM8_16' data-id='RM8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The Spirit himself unites with our spirits in bearing witness to our being God's children, </span>
<span class='v RM8_17' data-id='RM8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and if children, then heirs — heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ, since we share Christ's sufferings in order that we may also share his glory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_18' data-id='RM8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I do not count the sufferings of our present life worthy of mention when compared with the glory that is to be revealed and bestowed on us. </span>
<span class='v RM8_19' data-id='RM8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>All Nature awaits with eager expectation the appearing of the sons of God. </span>
<span class='v RM8_20' data-id='RM8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For Nature was made subject to imperfection — not by its own choice, but owing to him who made it so — </span>
<span class='v RM8_21' data-id='RM8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>yet not without the hope that some day Nature, also, will be set free from enslavement to decay, and will attain to the freedom which will mark the glory of the children of God. </span>
<span class='v RM8_22' data-id='RM8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>We know, indeed, that all Nature alike has been groaning in the pains of labour to this very hour. </span>
<span class='v RM8_23' data-id='RM8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And not Nature only; but we ourselves also, though we have already a first gift of the Spirit — we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we eagerly await our full adoption as sons — the redemption of our bodies. </span>
<span class='v RM8_24' data-id='RM8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>By our hope we were saved. But the thing hoped for is no longer an object of hope when it is before our eyes; for who hopes for what is before his eyes? </span>
<span class='v RM8_25' data-id='RM8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But when we hope for what is not before our eyes, then we wait for it with patience. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_26' data-id='RM8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So, also, the Spirit supports us in our weakness. We do not even know how to pray as we should; but the Spirit himself pleads for us in sighs that can find no utterance. </span>
<span class='v RM8_27' data-id='RM8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Yet he who searches all our hearts knows what the Spirit's meaning is, because the pleadings of the Spirit for Christ's people are in accordance with his will. </span>
<span class='v RM8_28' data-id='RM8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But we do know that God causes all things to work together for the good of those who love him — those who have received the call in accordance with his purpose. </span>
<span class='v RM8_29' data-id='RM8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For those whom God chose from the first he also destined from the first to be transformed into likeness to his Son, so that his Son might be the eldest amongst many brothers and sisters. </span>
<span class='v RM8_30' data-id='RM8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And those whom God destined for this he also called; and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous; and those whom he pronounced righteous he also brought to glory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_31' data-id='RM8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>What are we to say, then, in the light of all this? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_31' data-id='RM8_31'>If God is on our side, who can there be against us? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_32' data-id='RM8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>God did not withhold his own Son, but gave him up on behalf of us all; will he not, then, with him, freely give us all things? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_33' data-id='RM8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Who will bring a charge against any of God's people? He who pronounces them righteous is God! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_34' data-id='RM8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Who is there to condemn them? He who died for us is Christ Jesus! — or, rather, it was he who was raised from the dead, and who is now at God's right hand and is even pleading on our behalf! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_35' data-id='RM8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Who is there to separate us from the love of the Christ? Will trouble, or difficulty, or persecution, or hunger, or nakedness, or danger, or the sword? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_36' data-id='RM8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Scripture says — ‘For your sake we are being killed all the day long, We are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.’ </span>
<span class='v RM8_37' data-id='RM8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Yet amid all these things we more than conquer through him who loved us! </span>
<span class='v RM8_38' data-id='RM8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor archangels, nor the present, nor the future, nor any powers, </span>
<span class='v RM8_39' data-id='RM8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God revealed in Christ Jesus, our Lord! </span></div></div>
