<span class='v ZC7_1' data-id='ZC7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, on the fourth day of Chislev, the ninth month, the message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Zechariah. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_2' data-id='ZC7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The city of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men, to entreat the favour of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span>
<span class='v ZC7_3' data-id='ZC7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and to ask the priests of the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, and the prophets “Should I continue to mourn in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done for many years?” </span>
<span class='v ZC7_4' data-id='ZC7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts came to me: </span>
<span class='v ZC7_5' data-id='ZC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Tell all the people of the land and the priests, “When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the seventh month, for these seventy years, did you really fast for me? </span>
<span class='v ZC7_6' data-id='ZC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves? </span>
<span class='v ZC7_7' data-id='ZC7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Wasn't it this which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> proclaimed by the earlier prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, and her towns surrounding her and the Negreb and the Shephelah were inhabited?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_8' data-id='ZC7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave this message to Zechariah: </span>
<span class='v ZC7_9' data-id='ZC7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts says, execute true judgements. Show kindness and mercy to each other. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_10' data-id='ZC7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the resident alien or the poor. Let none of you devise evil against another in your hearts. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_11' data-id='ZC7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But they refused to listen, and turned a stubborn shoulder, and stopped their ears so they wouldn't hear. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_12' data-id='ZC7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They made their hearts as hard as stone so they wouldn't accept the teaching and the words that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets. Great was the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts: </span>
<span class='v ZC7_13' data-id='ZC7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I called and they would not hear, so they call and I do not hear, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_14' data-id='ZC7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I scattered them by a whirlwind out amongst nations unknown to them. The land was left desolate behind them, with no one crossing or returning, for they made the pleasant land a desolation. </span></div></div>
