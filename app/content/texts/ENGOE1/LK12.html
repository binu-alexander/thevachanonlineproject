<span class='v LK12_1' data-id='LK12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the people had gathered in thousands, so that they trod on one another, when Jesus, addressing himself to his disciples, began by saying to them, <span class='wj'>“Be on your guard against the leaven — that is, the hypocrisy — of the Pharisees.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_2' data-id='LK12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>There is nothing, however covered up, which will not be uncovered, nor anything kept secret which will not become known.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_3' data-id='LK12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So all that you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have spoken in the ear, within closed doors, will be proclaimed on the housetops.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_4' data-id='LK12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>To you who are my friends I say, Do not be afraid of those who kill the body, but after that can do no more.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_5' data-id='LK12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I will show you of whom you should be afraid. Be afraid of him who, after killing you, has the power to fling you into Gehenna. Yes, I say, be afraid of him.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_6' data-id='LK12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins? Yet not one of them has escaped God's notice.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_7' data-id='LK12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not be afraid; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_8' data-id='LK12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Everyone, I tell you, who publicly acknowledges me, the Son of Man, also, will acknowledge before God's angels;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_9' data-id='LK12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>but the person who publicly disowns me will be altogether disowned before God's angels.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_10' data-id='LK12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Everyone who will say anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but for the person who slanders the Holy Spirit there will be no forgiveness.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_11' data-id='LK12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Whenever they take you before the synagogue Courts or the magistrates or other authorities, do not be anxious as to how you will defend yourselves, or what your defence will be, or what you will say;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_12' data-id='LK12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for the Holy Spirit will show you at the moment what you ought to say.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK12_13' data-id='LK12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” a man in the crowd said to Jesus, “tell my brother to share the property with me.” </span>
<span class='v LK12_14' data-id='LK12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Man, who made me a judge or an arbiter between you?”</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_15' data-id='LK12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And then he added, <span class='wj'>“Take care to keep yourselves free from every form of covetousness; for even in the height of their prosperity a person's true life does not depend on what they have.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v LK12_16' data-id='LK12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them this parable — <span class='wj'>“There was once a rich man whose land was very fertile;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_17' data-id='LK12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and he began to ask himself ‘What will I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_18' data-id='LK12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>This is what I will do,’ he said; ‘I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them;</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_19' data-id='LK12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>and I will say to myself, Now you have plenty of good things put by for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_20' data-id='LK12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But God said to the man ‘Fool! This very night your life is being demanded; and as for all you have prepared — who will have it?’</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_21' data-id='LK12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So it is with those who lay by wealth for themselves and are not rich to the glory of God.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK12_22' data-id='LK12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“That is why I say to you, Do not be anxious about the life here — what you can get to eat; or about your body — what you can get to wear.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_23' data-id='LK12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For life is more than food, and the body than its clothes.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_24' data-id='LK12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Think of the ravens — they neither sow nor reap; they have neither storehouse nor barn; and yet God feeds them! And how much more precious are you than birds!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_25' data-id='LK12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But which of you, by being anxious, can prolong your life a moment?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_26' data-id='LK12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And, if you cannot do even the smallest thing, why be anxious about other things?</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_27' data-id='LK12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Think of the lilies, and how they grow. They neither toil nor spin; yet, I tell you, even Solomon in all his splendour was not robed like one of these.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_28' data-id='LK12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If, even in the field, God so clothes the grass which is living today and tomorrow will be thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you of little faith!</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_29' data-id='LK12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And you — do not be always seeking what you can get to eat or what you can get to drink; and do not waver.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_30' data-id='LK12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>These are the things for which all the nations of the world are seeking, and your Father knows that you need them.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_31' data-id='LK12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>No, seek his kingdom, and these things will be added for you.</span> </span>
<span class='v LK12_32' data-id='LK12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So do not be afraid, my little flock, for your Father has been pleased to give you the kingdom.</span> </span></div>
