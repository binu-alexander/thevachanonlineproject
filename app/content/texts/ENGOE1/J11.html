<span class='v J11_1' data-id='J11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>We write to you about the Word of life, which has been in existence from the beginning. We write of what we have heard, of what we have seen with our eyes, of what we watched reverently and touched with our hands. </span>
<span class='v J11_2' data-id='J11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>That life was made visible, and we have seen it. We bear our testimony to it, and tell you of that eternal life which was with the Father and was made visible to us. </span>
<span class='v J11_3' data-id='J11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It is of what we have seen and heard that we now tell you, so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v J11_4' data-id='J11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>We are writing all this to you that our joy may be complete. </span></div>

<span class='v J11_5' data-id='J11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is the message which we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. </span>
<span class='v J11_6' data-id='J11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet continue to walk in the darkness, our words and our lives are a lie. </span>
<span class='v J11_7' data-id='J11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin. </span>
<span class='v J11_8' data-id='J11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If we say, “we have no sin,” then we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us. </span>
<span class='v J11_9' data-id='J11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If we confess our sins, he is just and may be trusted to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all wrongdoing. </span>
<span class='v J11_10' data-id='J11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If we say that we haven't sinned, we make God a liar, and his Word is not in us. </span></div></div>
