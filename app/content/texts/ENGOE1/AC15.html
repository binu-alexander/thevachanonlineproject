<span class='v AC15_1' data-id='AC15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But certain persons came down from Judea, and began to teach the Lord's followers that, unless they were circumcised, in accordance with the custom required by Moses, they could not be saved. </span>
<span class='v AC15_2' data-id='AC15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This gave rise to a serious dispute, and much discussion, between Paul and Barnabas and these people, and it was therefore settled that Paul and Barnabas and others of their number should go up to Jerusalem, to consult the apostles and church elders about the matter under discussion. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_3' data-id='AC15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The church, therefore, sent them on their journey, and they made their way through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling the story of the conversion of the Gentiles, to the great joy of all the followers. </span>
<span class='v AC15_4' data-id='AC15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On their arrival at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, as well as by the apostles and the elders, and gave an account of all that God had helped them to do. </span>
<span class='v AC15_5' data-id='AC15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees' party, however, who had become believers in Christ, came forward and declared that they were bound to circumcise converts and to direct them to observe the Law of Moses. </span>
<span class='v AC15_6' data-id='AC15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The apostles and the church elders held a meeting to consider this question. </span>
<span class='v AC15_7' data-id='AC15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After much discussion, Peter rose and said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_7' data-id='AC15_7'>“You, my friends, know well that long ago God singled me out — that through my lips the Gentiles should hear the message of the good news, and become believers in Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC15_8' data-id='AC15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now God, who reads all hearts, declared his acceptance of the Gentiles, by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. </span>
<span class='v AC15_9' data-id='AC15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He made no distinction between them and us, when he purified their hearts by their faith. </span>
<span class='v AC15_10' data-id='AC15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Why, then, do you now provoke God, by putting on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our ancestors nor we were able to bear? </span>
<span class='v AC15_11' data-id='AC15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No, it is through the loving kindness of the Lord Jesus that we, just as they do, believe that we have been saved.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_12' data-id='AC15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Every voice in the assembly was hushed, as they listened to Barnabas and Paul, while they gave an account of all the signs and wonders which God had shown amongst the Gentiles through them. </span>
<span class='v AC15_13' data-id='AC15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>After they had finished speaking, James addressed the Council. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_13' data-id='AC15_13'>“Friends,” he began, “hear what I have to say. </span>
<span class='v AC15_14' data-id='AC15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Simon has described the manner in which God first visited the Gentiles, in order to take from amongst them a people to bear his name. </span>
<span class='v AC15_15' data-id='AC15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And that is in harmony with the words of the prophets, where they say — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>‘After this I will return; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>And I will rebuild the house of David which has fallen — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>Its ruins I will rebuild, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC15_16' data-id='AC15_16'>And will set it up once more; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>That so the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_17' data-id='AC15_17'>Even all the Gentiles on whom my name has been bestowed. </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC15_18' data-id='AC15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Says the Lord, as he does these things, known from long ago.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC15_19' data-id='AC15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In my judgement, therefore, we should not add to the difficulties of those Gentiles who are turning to God, </span>
<span class='v AC15_20' data-id='AC15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>but we should write to them to abstain from food that has been polluted by being sacrificed to idols, from impurity, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from blood. </span>
<span class='v AC15_21' data-id='AC15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For in every town, for generations past, there have been those who preach Moses, read as he is in the synagogues every Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_22' data-id='AC15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>It was then decided by the apostles and the elders, with the assent of the whole church, to choose some of their number, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. Those chosen were Judas (called Barsabas) and Silas, who were leaders amongst the community. </span>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They were bearers of the following letter — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC15_23' data-id='AC15_23'>‘The apostles, and the followers who are the church elders, send their greetings to the followers of the Lord of Gentile birth in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v AC15_24' data-id='AC15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>As we had heard that some of our number had upset you by their assertions, and unsettled your minds — without instructions from us — </span>
<span class='v AC15_25' data-id='AC15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>We met and decided to choose certain men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, </span>
<span class='v AC15_26' data-id='AC15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC15_27' data-id='AC15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>We are accordingly sending Judas and Silas, and they will tell you by word of mouth what we are now writing. </span>
<span class='v AC15_28' data-id='AC15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>We have, therefore, decided, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, to lay no further burden on you beyond these necessary conditions — </span>
<span class='v AC15_29' data-id='AC15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>That you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating the flesh of strangled animals, and from impurity. If you guard yourselves against such things, it will be well with you. Farewell.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC15_30' data-id='AC15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So the bearers of this letter were sent on their way, and went down to Antioch. There they called a meeting of all the followers, </span>
<span class='v AC15_31' data-id='AC15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and delivered the letter, the reading of which caused great rejoicing by its encouraging contents. </span>
<span class='v AC15_32' data-id='AC15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, further encouraged the them by many an address, and strengthened their faith. </span>
<span class='v AC15_33' data-id='AC15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>After some stay, they were dismissed with kind farewells from the followers, and returned to those who had sent them. </span>
<span class='v AC15_34' data-id='AC15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='note' id='footnote-24'><a href='#note-24' class='key'>*</a></span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC15_35' data-id='AC15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Paul and Barnabas, however, remained in Antioch, where they taught and, with the help of many others, told the good news of the Lord's message. </span>
<span class='v AC15_36' data-id='AC15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Some time after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us go back and visit the Lord's followers in every town in which we have told the Lord's message, and see how they are prospering.” </span>
<span class='v AC15_37' data-id='AC15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Barnabas wished to take with them John, whose other name was Mark; </span>
<span class='v AC15_38' data-id='AC15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>but Paul felt that they ought not to take with them the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone on with them to their work. </span>
<span class='v AC15_39' data-id='AC15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>This caused such unpleasant feeling between them that they parted ways, Barnabas taking Mark and sailing for Cyprus, </span>
<span class='v AC15_40' data-id='AC15_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>while Paul chose Silas for his companion and, after he had been committed by the followers to the gracious care of the Lord, </span>
<span class='v AC15_41' data-id='AC15_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>started on his journey and went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches in the faith. </span></div></div>
