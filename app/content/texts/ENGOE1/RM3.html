<div class='c'>3</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_1' data-id='RM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>What is the advantage, then, of being a Jew? Or what is the good of circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM3_2' data-id='RM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Great in every way. First of all, because the Jews were entrusted with God's utterances. </span>
<span class='v RM3_3' data-id='RM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>What follows then? Some, no doubt, showed a want of faith; but will their want of faith make God break faith? Heaven forbid! </span>
<span class='v RM3_4' data-id='RM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>God must prove true, though everyone prove a liar! As scripture says of God — ‘That you may be pronounced righteous in what you say, and gain your cause when people would judge you.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_5' data-id='RM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But what if our wrong-doing makes God's righteousness all the clearer? Will God be wrong in inflicting punishment? (I can but speak as a person.) Heaven forbid! </span>
<span class='v RM3_6' data-id='RM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Otherwise how can God judge the world? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_7' data-id='RM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But, if my falsehood redounds to the glory of God, by making his truthfulness more apparent, why am I like others, still condemned as a sinner? </span>
<span class='v RM3_8' data-id='RM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Why should we not say — as some people slanderously assert that we do say — ‘Let us do evil that good may come’? The condemnation of such people is indeed just! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_9' data-id='RM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What follows, then? Are we Jews in any way superior to others? Not at all. Our indictment against both Jews and Greeks was that all alike were in subjection to sin. </span>
<span class='v RM3_10' data-id='RM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>As scripture says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_10' data-id='RM3_10'>‘There is not even one who is righteous, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_11' data-id='RM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>not one who understands, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_11' data-id='RM3_11'>not one who is searching for God! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They have all gone astray; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'>they have one and all become depraved; </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'>there is no one who is doing good — no, not one!’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>‘Their throats are like opened graves; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'>they deceive with their tongues.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'>‘The venom of snakes lies behind their lips,’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_14' data-id='RM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>‘And their mouths are full of bitter curses.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_15' data-id='RM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>‘Swift are their feet to shed blood. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM3_16' data-id='RM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Distress and trouble dog their steps, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM3_17' data-id='RM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and the path of peace they do not know.’ </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v RM3_18' data-id='RM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>‘The fear of God is not before their eyes.’ </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_19' data-id='RM3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now we know that everything said in the Law is addressed to those who are under its authority, in order that every mouth may be closed, and to bring the whole world under God's judgement. </span>
<span class='v RM3_20' data-id='RM3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For no human being will be pronounced righteous before God as the result of obedience to Law; for it is Law that shows what sin is. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_21' data-id='RM3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But now, quite apart from Law, the divine righteousness stands revealed, and to it the Law and the prophets bear witness — </span>
<span class='v RM3_22' data-id='RM3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>the divine righteousness which is bestowed, through faith in Jesus Christ, on all, without distinction, who believe in him. </span>
<span class='v RM3_23' data-id='RM3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For all have sinned, and all fall short of God's glorious ideal, </span>
<span class='v RM3_24' data-id='RM3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>but, in his loving kindness, are being freely pronounced righteous through the deliverance found in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v RM3_25' data-id='RM3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For God set him before the world, to be, by the shedding of his blood, a means of reconciliation through faith. And this God did to prove his righteousness, and because, in his forbearance, he had passed over the sins that people had previously committed; </span>
<span class='v RM3_26' data-id='RM3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>as a proof, I repeat, at the present time, of his own righteousness, that he might be righteous in our eyes, and might pronounce righteous the person who takes their stand on faith in Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_27' data-id='RM3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>What, then, becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what sort of Law? A Law requiring obedience? No, a Law requiring faith. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_28' data-id='RM3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For we conclude that a person is pronounced righteous on the ground of faith, quite apart from obedience to Law. </span>
<span class='v RM3_29' data-id='RM3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Or can it be that God is the God only of the Jews? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? </span>
<span class='v RM3_30' data-id='RM3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Yes, of the Gentiles also, since there is only one God, and he will pronounce those who are circumcised righteous as the result of faith, and also those who are uncircumcised on their showing the same faith. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM3_31' data-id='RM3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Do we, then, use this faith to abolish Law? Heaven forbid! No, we establish Law. </span></div></div>
