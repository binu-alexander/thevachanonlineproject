<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_1' data-id='HB2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore we must give still more heed to what we were taught, so we do not drift away. </span>
<span class='v HB2_2' data-id='HB2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For, if the message which was delivered by angels had its authority confirmed, so that every offence against it, or neglect of it, met with a fitting requital, </span>
<span class='v HB2_3' data-id='HB2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>how can we, of all people, expect to escape, if we disregard so great a salvation? It was the Master who at the outset spoke of this salvation, and its authority was confirmed for us by those who heard him, </span>
<span class='v HB2_4' data-id='HB2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>while God himself added his testimony to it by signs, and marvels, and many different miracles, as well as by imparting the Holy Spirit as he saw fit. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_5' data-id='HB2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>God has not given to angels the control of that future world of which we are speaking! </span>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>No; a writer has declared somewhere — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>‘What are mere mortals that you should remember them? </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>Or human beings that you should care for them? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You have made them, for a while, lower than angels; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'>With glory and honour you have crowned them; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'>You have set them over all that your hands have made; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You have placed all things beneath their feet.’ </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'>This ‘placing of everything’ under humanity means that there was nothing which was not placed under them. As yet, however, we do not see everything placed under humanity. </span>
<span class='v HB2_9' data-id='HB2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What our eyes do see is Jesus, who was made for a while lower than angels, now, because of his sufferings and death, crowned with glory and honour; so that his tasting the bitterness of death should, in God's loving kindness, be on behalf of all humanity. </span>
<span class='v HB2_10' data-id='HB2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It was, indeed, fitting that God, for whom and through whom all things exist, should, when leading many children to glory, make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering. </span>
<span class='v HB2_11' data-id='HB2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he who purifies, and those whom he purifies, all spring from One; and therefore he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. </span>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'>‘I will tell of your name to my brothers and sisters, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'>In the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And again — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'>‘As for me, I will put my trust in God.’ </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'>And yet again — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'>‘See, here am I and the children whom God gave me.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_14' data-id='HB2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore, since human nature is the common heritage of the children, Jesus also shared it, in order that by death he might render powerless him whose power lies in death — that is, the devil — </span>
<span class='v HB2_15' data-id='HB2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and so might deliver all those who, from fear of death, had all their lives been living in slavery. </span>
<span class='v HB2_16' data-id='HB2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>It was not, surely, to the help of the angels that Jesus came, but to the help of the descendants of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v HB2_17' data-id='HB2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And consequently it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers and sisters, in order that he might prove a merciful as well as a faithful high priest in humanity's relations with God, for the purpose of expiating the sins of his people. </span>
<span class='v HB2_18' data-id='HB2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The fact that he himself suffered under temptation enables him to help those who are tempted. </span></div></div>
