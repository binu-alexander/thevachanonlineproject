<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_1' data-id='RM12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I entreat you, then, friends, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, for this is your rational worship. </span>
<span class='v RM12_2' data-id='RM12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Do not conform to the fashion of this world; but be transformed by the complete change that has come over your minds, so that you may discern what God's will is — all that is good, acceptable, and perfect. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_3' data-id='RM12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In fulfilment of the charge with which I have been entrusted, I tell every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think until he learns to think soberly — in accordance with the measure of faith that God has allotted to each. </span>
<span class='v RM12_4' data-id='RM12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For, just as in the human body there is a union of many parts, and each part has its own function, </span>
<span class='v RM12_5' data-id='RM12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>so we, by our union in Christ, many though we are, form but one body, and individually we are related one to another as its parts. </span>
<span class='v RM12_6' data-id='RM12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Since our gifts differ in accordance with the particular charge entrusted to us, if our gift is to preach, let our preaching correspond to our faith; </span>
<span class='v RM12_7' data-id='RM12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>if it is to minister to others, let us devote ourselves to our ministry; the teacher to their teaching, </span>
<span class='v RM12_8' data-id='RM12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>the counsellor to their counsel. Let the person who gives in charity do so with a generous heart; let the person who is in authority exercise due diligence; let the person who shows kindness do so in a cheerful spirit. </span>
<span class='v RM12_9' data-id='RM12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let your love be sincere. Hate the wrong; cling to the right. </span>
<span class='v RM12_10' data-id='RM12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In the love of the community of the Lord's followers, be affectionate to one another; in showing respect, set an example of deference to one another; </span>
<span class='v RM12_11' data-id='RM12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>never flagging in zeal; fervent in spirit; serving the Master; </span>
<span class='v RM12_12' data-id='RM12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>rejoicing in your hope; steadfast under persecution; persevering in prayer; </span>
<span class='v RM12_13' data-id='RM12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>relieving the wants of Christ's people; devoted to hospitality. </span>
<span class='v RM12_14' data-id='RM12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Bless your persecutors — bless and never curse. </span>
<span class='v RM12_15' data-id='RM12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Rejoice with those who are rejoicing, and weep with those who are weeping. </span>
<span class='v RM12_16' data-id='RM12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let the same spirit of sympathy animate you all, not a spirit of pride; enjoy the company of ordinary people. Do not think too highly of yourselves. </span>
<span class='v RM12_17' data-id='RM12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Never return injury for injury. Aim at doing what everyone will recognise as honourable. </span>
<span class='v RM12_18' data-id='RM12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If it is possible, as far as rests with you, live peaceably with everyone. </span>
<span class='v RM12_19' data-id='RM12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Never avenge yourselves, dear friends, but make way for the wrath of God; for scripture declares — ‘ “It is for me to avenge, I will requite,” says the Lord.’ </span>
<span class='v RM12_20' data-id='RM12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Rather — ‘If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him to drink. By doing this you will heap coals of fire on his head.’ </span>
<span class='v RM12_21' data-id='RM12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Never be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good. </span></div></div>
