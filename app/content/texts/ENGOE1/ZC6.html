<span class='v ZC6_1' data-id='ZC6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again I looked up, and saw four chariots come from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of bronze. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_2' data-id='ZC6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The first chariot had red horses. The second chariot had black horses, </span>
<span class='v ZC6_3' data-id='ZC6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>the third chariot white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_4' data-id='ZC6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then I said to the messenger who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span>
<span class='v ZC6_5' data-id='ZC6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The messenger answered me, “These are the four winds of heaven going out after standing before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of all the earth. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_6' data-id='ZC6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The black horses are going towards the north country and the white towards the west and the dappled towards the south country.” </span>
<span class='v ZC6_7' data-id='ZC6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The strong horses came out, and were impatient to patrol the earth. So he said, “Go, patrol the earth.” and they did so. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_8' data-id='ZC6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he cried out to me, “The horses that went to the north country will quiet my spirit in the north country.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC6_9' data-id='ZC6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v ZC6_10' data-id='ZC6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Take the gifts from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah who have come from Babylon and go at once to Josiah the son of Zephaniah. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_11' data-id='ZC6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Take their silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC6_12' data-id='ZC6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Tell him: “Thus says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts: Behold, the man whose name is the Branch. He will branch out from his place and rebuild the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_13' data-id='ZC6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He will rebuild the temple and will sit and rule upon his throne, receiving the honour due to a king. A priest will stand by his throne and they will work together in peace and harmony. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_14' data-id='ZC6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The crown will be a memorial in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for Heldai and Tobijah and Jedaiah, and Josiah the son of Zephaniah. </span>
<span class='v ZC6_15' data-id='ZC6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>People from far away will come and build in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and you will know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts has sent me to you.
