<span class='v JN16_2' data-id='JN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They will expel you from their synagogues; indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think that they are making an offering to God.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_3' data-id='JN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>They will do this, because they have not learnt to know the Father, or even me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But I have spoken to you of these things so that, when the time for them comes, you may remember that I told you about them myself.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_5' data-id='JN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I did not tell you all this at first, because I was with you. But now I am to return to him who sent me; and yet not one of you asks me — ‘Where are you going?’</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_6' data-id='JN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Although your hearts are full of sorrow at all that I have been saying to you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_7' data-id='JN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet I am only telling you the truth; it is for your good that I should go away. For otherwise the helper will never come to you, but, if I leave you, I will send him to you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_8' data-id='JN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And he, when he comes, will bring conviction to the world as to sin, and as to righteousness, and as to judgement;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_9' data-id='JN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>as to sin, for people do not believe in me;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_10' data-id='JN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>as to righteousness, for I am going to the Father, and you will see me no longer;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_11' data-id='JN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>as to judgement, for the Spirit that is ruling this world has been condemned.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_12' data-id='JN16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have still much to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_13' data-id='JN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Yet when he — The Spirit of truth — comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but he will speak of all that he hears; and he will tell you of the things that are to come.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_14' data-id='JN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>He will honour me; because he will take of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_15' data-id='JN16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he takes of what is mine, and will tell it to you.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_16' data-id='JN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In a little while you will no longer see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed.”</span> </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_17' data-id='JN16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>At this some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying to us <span class='wj'>‘In a little while you will not see me, and then in a little while you will see me indeed’;</span> and by saying <span class='wj'>‘Because I am going to the Father’?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_18' data-id='JN16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by <span class='wj'>‘In a little while’?”</span> they said; “we do not know what he is speaking about.” </span>
<span class='v JN16_19' data-id='JN16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw that they were wanting to ask him a question, and said, <span class='wj'>“Are you trying to find out from one another what I meant by saying ‘In a little while you will not see me; and then in a little while you will see me indeed’?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_20' data-id='JN16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>In truth I tell you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice; you will suffer pain, but your pain will turn to joy.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_21' data-id='JN16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>A woman in labour is in pain because her time has come; but no sooner is the child born, than she forgets her trouble in her joy that a child has been born into the world.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_22' data-id='JN16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You, in the same way, are sorry now; but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will rob you of your joy.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_23' data-id='JN16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>And at that time you will not ask me anything; in truth I tell you, if you ask the Father for anything, he will grant it to you in my name.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_24' data-id='JN16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>So far you have not asked for anything, in my name; ask, and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_25' data-id='JN16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have spoken to you of all this in figures; a time is coming, however, when I will not speak any longer to you in figures, but will tell you about the Father plainly.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_26' data-id='JN16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You will ask, at that time, in my name; and I do not say that I will intercede with the Father for you;</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_27' data-id='JN16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came from the Father.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_28' data-id='JN16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; and now I am to leave the world, and go to the Father.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_29' data-id='JN16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“At last,” exclaimed the disciples, “you are using plain words and not speaking in figures at all. </span>
<span class='v JN16_30' data-id='JN16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now we are sure that you know everything, and need not wait for anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you did come from God.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_31' data-id='JN16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Do you believe that already?”</span> Jesus answered. </span>
<span class='v JN16_32' data-id='JN16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Listen! A time is coming — indeed it has already come — when you are to be scattered, each going his own way, and to leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN16_33' data-id='JN16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I have spoken to you in this way, so that in me you may find peace. In the world you will find trouble; yet, take courage! I have conquered the world.”</span> </span></div></div>
