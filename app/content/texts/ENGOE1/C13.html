<span class='v C13_1' data-id='C13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But I, my friends, could not speak to you as people with spiritual insight, but only as worldly-minded — mere infants in the faith of Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_2' data-id='C13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you were not then able to take it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_2' data-id='C13_2'>No, and even now you are not able; you are still worldly. </span>
<span class='v C13_3' data-id='C13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>While there exist amongst you jealousy and party feeling, is it not true that you are worldly, and are acting merely as other people do? </span>
<span class='v C13_4' data-id='C13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When one says ‘I follow Paul,’ and another ‘I follow Apollos,’ aren't you like other people? </span>
<span class='v C13_5' data-id='C13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>What, I ask, is Apollos? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you were led to accept the faith; and that only as the Lord helped each of you. </span>
<span class='v C13_6' data-id='C13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I planted, and Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth. </span>
<span class='v C13_7' data-id='C13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore neither the one who plants, nor the one who waters, counts for anything, but only God who causes the growth. </span>
<span class='v C13_8' data-id='C13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In this the person who plants and the person who waters are one; yet each will receive their own reward in proportion to their own labour. </span>
<span class='v C13_9' data-id='C13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's harvest field, God's building. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_10' data-id='C13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In fulfilment of the charge which God had entrusted to me, I laid the foundation like a skilful master; but someone else is now building on it. Let everyone take care how they build; </span>
<span class='v C13_11' data-id='C13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>for no one can lay any other foundation than the one already laid — Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_12' data-id='C13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Whatever is used by those who build on this foundation, whether gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, </span>
<span class='v C13_13' data-id='C13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>the quality of each man's work will become known, for the day will make it plain; because that day is to be ushered in with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of every man's work. </span>
<span class='v C13_14' data-id='C13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If anyone's work, which they have built on that foundation, still remains, they will gain a reward. </span>
<span class='v C13_15' data-id='C13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If anyone's work is burnt up, they will suffer loss; though they themselves will escape, but only as one who has passed through fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_16' data-id='C13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Don't you know that you are God's Temple, and that God's Spirit has his home in you? </span>
<span class='v C13_17' data-id='C13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If any one destroys the Temple of God, God will destroy them; for the Temple of God is sacred, and so also are you. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v C13_18' data-id='C13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If any one amongst you imagines that, as regards this world, they are wise, they should become a ‘fool,’ that they may become wise. </span>
<span class='v C13_19' data-id='C13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For in God's sight this world's wisdom is folly. Scripture tells of — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C13_19' data-id='C13_19'>‘One who catches the wise in their own craftiness,’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v C13_20' data-id='C13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And it says again — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C13_20' data-id='C13_20'>‘The Lord sees how fruitless are the deliberations of the wise.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v C13_21' data-id='C13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one boast about people; for all things are yours — </span>
<span class='v C13_22' data-id='C13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future — all things are yours! </span>
<span class='v C13_23' data-id='C13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But you are Christ's and Christ is God's. </span></div></div>
