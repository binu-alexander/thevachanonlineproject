<span class='v MT2_1' data-id='MT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the birth of Jesus at Bethlehem in Judea, in the reign of King Herod, some astrologers from the East arrived in Jerusalem, asking, </span>
<span class='v MT2_2' data-id='MT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Where is the newborn king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_3' data-id='MT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When King Herod heard of this, he was much troubled, and so too was all Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v MT2_4' data-id='MT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He called together all the chief priests and teachers of the Law in the nation, and questioned them as to where the Christ was to be born. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_5' data-id='MT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“At Bethlehem in Judea,” was their answer, “for it is said in the prophet — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>‘And you, Bethlehem in Judah's land, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>are in no way least amongst the chief cities of Judah, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>for out of you will come a ruler — </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_7' data-id='MT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Herod secretly sent for the astrologers. He found out from them the time of the appearance of the star. </span>
<span class='v MT2_8' data-id='MT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Sending them to Bethlehem he said, “Go and make a careful search for the child. When you have found him, bring word back to me, so that I, too, can go and worship him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_9' data-id='MT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The astrologers heard what the king had to say, and then continued their journey. The star which they had seen in the east led them on, until it reached and stood over the place where the child was. </span>
<span class='v MT2_10' data-id='MT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>At the sight of the star they were filled with joy. </span>
<span class='v MT2_11' data-id='MT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Entering the house, they saw the child with his mother, Mary, and fell at his feet and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasure chests, and offered to the child presents of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. </span>
<span class='v MT2_12' data-id='MT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But afterward, having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another road. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_13' data-id='MT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and seek refuge in Egypt; and stay there until I tell you to return, for Herod is about to search for the child, to put him to death.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_14' data-id='MT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Joseph woke up, and taking the child and his mother by night, went into Egypt, </span>
<span class='v MT2_15' data-id='MT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and there he stayed until Herod's death; in fulfilment of these words of the Lord in the prophet, where he says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_15' data-id='MT2_15'>‘Out of Egypt I called my Son.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_16' data-id='MT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When Herod found out that the astrologers had tricked him, he flew into a rage. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and the whole of that region, who were two years old or under, guided by the time which he had learnt from the astrologers. </span>
<span class='v MT2_17' data-id='MT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then were fulfilled these words spoken in the prophet Jeremiah, where he says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>‘A voice was heard in Ramah, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>weeping and mourning loudly; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>Rachel, weeping for her children, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>refusing all comfort for they were dead.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_19' data-id='MT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But, on the death of Herod, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and said, </span>
<span class='v MT2_20' data-id='MT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Get up, take the child and his mother, and go into the Land of Israel, for those who sought to take the child's life are dead.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_21' data-id='MT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He woke up, and taking the child and his mother, went into the Land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT2_22' data-id='MT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But, hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go back there; and having been warned in a dream, he went into the part of the country called Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MT2_23' data-id='MT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>There he settled in the town of Nazareth, in fulfilment of these words in the prophets — ‘He will be called a Nazarene.’ </span></div></div>
