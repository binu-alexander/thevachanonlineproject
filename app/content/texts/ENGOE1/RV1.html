<span class='v RV1_4' data-id='RV1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>From John, to the seven churches which are in Roman Asia. Blessing and peace be yours from him who is, and who was, and who will be, and from the seven spirits that are before his throne, </span>
<span class='v RV1_5' data-id='RV1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the Ruler of all the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his own blood — </span>
<span class='v RV1_6' data-id='RV1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and he made us a kingdom of priests in the service of God, his Father! — to Him be ascribed glory and dominion for ever. Amen. </span>
<span class='v RV1_7' data-id='RV1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He is coming amongst the clouds! Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him and all the nations of the earth will mourn over him. So will it be. Amen. </span></div>

<span class='v RV1_9' data-id='RV1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I, John, who am your brother, and who share with you in the suffering and kingship and endurance of Jesus, found myself on the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony to Jesus. </span>
<span class='v RV1_10' data-id='RV1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I fell into a trance on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, like the blast of a trumpet. </span>
<span class='v RV1_11' data-id='RV1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It said — <span class='wj'>‘Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicaea.’</span> </span>
<span class='v RV1_12' data-id='RV1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I turned to see what voice it was that spoke to me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lamps, </span>
<span class='v RV1_13' data-id='RV1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and in the midst of the lamps one like a man, in a robe reaching to his feet, and with a golden sash across his breast. </span>
<span class='v RV1_14' data-id='RV1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The hair of his head was as white as wool, as white as snow; his eyes were like flaming fire; </span>
<span class='v RV1_15' data-id='RV1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and his feet were like brass as when molten in a furnace; his voice was like the sound of many streams, </span>
<span class='v RV1_16' data-id='RV1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun in the fulness of its power. </span>
<span class='v RV1_17' data-id='RV1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And, when I saw him, I fell at his feet like one dead. He laid his hand on me and said — <span class='wj'>‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,</span> </span>
<span class='v RV1_18' data-id='RV1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>the Everliving. I died, and I am alive for ever and ever. And I hold the keys of death and of Hades.</span> </span>
