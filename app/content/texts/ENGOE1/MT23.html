<span class='v MT23_8' data-id='MT23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But do not allow yourselves to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have only one teacher, and you yourselves are all brothers and sisters.</span> </span>

<span class='v MT23_28' data-id='MT23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>It is the same with you. Outwardly, and to others, you have the look of religious people, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and sin.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT23_29' data-id='MT23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Alas for you, teachers of the Law and Pharisees, hypocrites that you are! You build the tombs of the prophets, and decorate the monuments of religious people,</span> </span>

<span class='v MT23_34' data-id='MT23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>That is why I send you prophets, wise people, and teachers of the Law, some of whom you will crucify and kill, and some of whom you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from town to town;</span> </span>
<span class='v MT23_35' data-id='MT23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>in order the blood on your heads may fall every drop of innocent blood split on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel down to that of Zechariah, Barachiah's son, whom you murdered between the Temple and the altar.</span> </span>
<span class='v MT23_36' data-id='MT23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>All this, I tell you, will come home to the present generation.</span> </span>
