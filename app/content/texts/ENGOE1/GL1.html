<span class='v GL1_1' data-id='GL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>To the churches in Galatia, from Paul, an apostle whose commission is not from any human authority and is given, not by human beings, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead; </span>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and from all the followers of the Lord here. </span>
<span class='v GL1_3' data-id='GL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>May God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you and give you peace. For Christ, to rescue us from this present wicked age, </span>
<span class='v GL1_4' data-id='GL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>gave himself for our sins, in accordance with the will of God and Father, </span>
<span class='v GL1_5' data-id='GL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to whom be ascribed all glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_6' data-id='GL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am astonished at your so soon deserting him, who called you through the love of Christ, for a different ‘good news,’ </span>
<span class='v GL1_7' data-id='GL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>which is really no good news at all. But then, I know that there are people who are harassing you, and who want to pervert the good news of the Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_8' data-id='GL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yet even if we — or if an angel from heaven were to tell you any other ‘good news’ than that which we told you, may he be accursed! </span>
<span class='v GL1_9' data-id='GL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>We have said it before, and I repeat it now — If anyone tells you a ‘good news’ other than that which you received, may he be accursed! </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_10' data-id='GL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Is this, I ask, trying to conciliate people, or God? Am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I should not be a servant of Christ. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_11' data-id='GL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I remind you, friends, that the good news which I told is no mere human invention. </span>
<span class='v GL1_12' data-id='GL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I, at least, did not receive it from any human being, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through a revelation made by Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_13' data-id='GL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You heard, no doubt, of my conduct when I was devoted to Judaism — how I persecuted the church of God to an extent beyond belief, and made havoc of it, </span>
<span class='v GL1_14' data-id='GL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and how, in my devotion to Judaism, I surpassed many of my contemporaries amongst my own people in my intense earnestness in upholding the traditions of my ancestors. </span>
<span class='v GL1_15' data-id='GL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when God, who had set me apart even before my birth, and who called me by his love, </span>
<span class='v GL1_16' data-id='GL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>saw fit to reveal his Son in me, so that I might tell the good news of him amongst the Gentiles, then at once, instead of consulting any human being, </span>
<span class='v GL1_17' data-id='GL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, I went to Arabia, and came back again to Damascus. </span>
<span class='v GL1_18' data-id='GL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Three years afterward I went up to Jerusalem to make the acquaintance of Peter, and I stayed a fortnight with him. </span>
<span class='v GL1_19' data-id='GL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I did not, however, see any other apostle, except James, the Master's brother. </span>
<span class='v GL1_20' data-id='GL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>(As to what I am now writing to you, I call God to witness that I am speaking the truth). </span>
<span class='v GL1_21' data-id='GL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Afterward I went to the districts of Syria and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v GL1_22' data-id='GL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But I was still unknown even by sight to the Christian churches in Judea; </span>
<span class='v GL1_23' data-id='GL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>all that they had heard was — ‘The man who once persecuted us is now telling the good news of the faith of which he once made havoc.’ </span>
<span class='v GL1_24' data-id='GL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they praised God for my sake. </span></div></div>
