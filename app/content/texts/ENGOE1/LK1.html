<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_1' data-id='LK1_1'>Many attempts have been already made to draw up an account of those events which have reached their conclusion amongst us, </span>
<span class='v LK1_2' data-id='LK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>just as they were reported to us by those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses, and afterward became bearers of the message. </span>
<span class='v LK1_3' data-id='LK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And, therefore, I also, since I have investigated all these events with great care from their very beginning, have resolved to write a connected history of them for you, </span>
<span class='v LK1_4' data-id='LK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>in order that you may be able to satisfy yourself of the accuracy of the story which you have heard from the lips of others. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_5' data-id='LK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the reign of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division called after Abijah. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. </span>
<span class='v LK1_6' data-id='LK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK1_7' data-id='LK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_8' data-id='LK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>One day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, </span>
<span class='v LK1_9' data-id='LK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practise amongst the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; </span>
<span class='v LK1_10' data-id='LK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. </span>
<span class='v LK1_11' data-id='LK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. </span>
<span class='v LK1_12' data-id='LK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. </span>
<span class='v LK1_13' data-id='LK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. </span>
<span class='v LK1_14' data-id='LK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_15' data-id='LK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, </span>
<span class='v LK1_16' data-id='LK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_17' data-id='LK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_18' data-id='LK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_19' data-id='LK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“I am Gabriel,” the angel answered, “who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. </span>
<span class='v LK1_20' data-id='LK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_21' data-id='LK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. </span>
<span class='v LK1_22' data-id='LK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. </span>
<span class='v LK1_23' data-id='LK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. </span>
<span class='v LK1_24' data-id='LK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. </span>
<span class='v LK1_25' data-id='LK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_26' data-id='LK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, </span>
<span class='v LK1_27' data-id='LK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. </span>
<span class='v LK1_28' data-id='LK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying, “You have been shown great favour - the Lord is with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_29' data-id='LK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Mary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, </span>
<span class='v LK1_30' data-id='LK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>when the angel spoke again, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_31' data-id='LK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK1_32' data-id='LK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The child will be great and will be called ‘Son of the Most High,’ and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, </span>
<span class='v LK1_33' data-id='LK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_34' data-id='LK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“How can this be?” Mary asked the angel. “For I have no husband.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_35' data-id='LK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“The Holy Spirit will descend on you,” answered the angel, “and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called ‘holy,’ and ‘Son of God.’ </span>
<span class='v LK1_36' data-id='LK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; </span>
<span class='v LK1_37' data-id='LK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_38' data-id='LK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“I am the servant of the Lord,” exclaimed Mary; “let it be with me as you have said.” Then the angel left her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_39' data-id='LK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Soon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; </span>
<span class='v LK1_40' data-id='LK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_41' data-id='LK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v LK1_42' data-id='LK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>and cried aloud, “Blessed are you amongst women, and blessed is your unborn child! </span>
<span class='v LK1_43' data-id='LK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>But how have I this honour, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </span>
<span class='v LK1_44' data-id='LK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! </span>
<span class='v LK1_45' data-id='LK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_46' data-id='LK1_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And Mary said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK1_46' data-id='LK1_46'>“My soul exalts the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK1_47' data-id='LK1_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>and my spirit delights in God my Saviour, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK1_48' data-id='LK1_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>for he has looked with favour on his humble servant girl. </span></div>

<span class='v LK1_53' data-id='LK1_53'>and the rich he has sent away empty. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK1_54' data-id='LK1_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>“He has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK1_55' data-id='LK1_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>as he promised to our ancestors </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK1_56' data-id='LK1_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. </span>
<span class='v LK1_57' data-id='LK1_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; </span>
<span class='v LK1_58' data-id='LK1_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>and her neighbours and relatives, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. </span>
<span class='v LK1_59' data-id='LK1_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him Zechariah after his father, </span>
<span class='v LK1_60' data-id='LK1_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>when his mother spoke up, “No, he is to be called John.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_61' data-id='LK1_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>“You have no relation of that name!” they exclaimed; </span>
<span class='v LK1_62' data-id='LK1_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. </span>
<span class='v LK1_63' data-id='LK1_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words — ‘His name is John.’ Everyone was surprised </span>
<span class='v LK1_64' data-id='LK1_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_65' data-id='LK1_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>All their neighbours were awe-struck at this, and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about. </span>
<span class='v LK1_66' data-id='LK1_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>All who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another — “What can this child be destined to become?” For the Power of the Lord was with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_67' data-id='LK1_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said: </span></div>
