<span class='v H23_1' data-id='H23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In conclusion, friends, pray for us — pray that the Lord's message may spread rapidly, and be received everywhere with honour, as it was amongst you; </span>
<span class='v H23_2' data-id='H23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and that we may be preserved from wrong-headed and wicked people — for it is not everyone who believes in Christ. </span>
<span class='v H23_3' data-id='H23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the Lord will not fail you; he will give you strength, and guard you from evil. </span>
<span class='v H23_4' data-id='H23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Yes, and the confidence that our union with the Lord enables us to place in you leads us to believe that you are doing, and will do, what we direct you. </span>
<span class='v H23_5' data-id='H23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>May the Lord bring you to the love of God, and to the patience of the Christ. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v H23_6' data-id='H23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We beg you, friends, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to avoid any follower who is living an ill-ordered life, which is not in agreement with the teaching that you received from us. </span>
<span class='v H23_7' data-id='H23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For you know well that you ought to follow our example. When we were with you, our life was not ill-ordered, </span>
<span class='v H23_8' data-id='H23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it. Night and day, labouring and toiling, we used to work at our trades, so as not to be a burden on any of you. </span>
<span class='v H23_9' data-id='H23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This was not because we had not a right to receive support, but our object was to give you a pattern for you to copy. </span>
<span class='v H23_10' data-id='H23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, when we were with you, the rule we laid down was — ‘Whoever does not choose to work will not get to eat.’ </span>
<span class='v H23_11' data-id='H23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>We hear that there are amongst you people who are living ill-ordered lives, and who, instead of attending to their own business, are mere busybodies. </span>
<span class='v H23_12' data-id='H23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All such people we beg, and implore,, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, to attend quietly to their business, and earn their own living. </span>
<span class='v H23_13' data-id='H23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You, friends, must not grow weary of doing what is right. </span>
<span class='v H23_14' data-id='H23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If anyone disregards what we have said in this letter, take note of them and avoid their company, so that they may feel ashamed. </span>
<span class='v H23_15' data-id='H23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet do not think of them as an enemy, but caution them as you would a brother or sister. </span>
<span class='v H23_16' data-id='H23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord, from whom all peace comes, himself give you his peace at all times and in all ways. May he be with you all. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v H23_17' data-id='H23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting. It is my signature to every letter. This is how I write. </span>
<span class='v H23_18' data-id='H23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>May the blessing of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. </span></div></div>
