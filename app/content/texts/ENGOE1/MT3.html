<div class='s'>The Preparation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_1' data-id='MT3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>About that time John the Baptist first appeared, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea: </span>
<span class='v MT3_2' data-id='MT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </span>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>John was the one who was spoken of in the prophet Isaiah, where he says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>‘The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>“Make ready the way of the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>make his paths straight.” ’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_4' data-id='MT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>John's clothes were made of camels' hair, with a leather strap around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. </span>
<span class='v MT3_5' data-id='MT3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>At that time Jerusalem, and all Judea, as well as the whole district of the Jordan, went out to him </span>
<span class='v MT3_6' data-id='MT3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and were baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_7' data-id='MT3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to receive his baptism, he said to them, “You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgement? </span>
<span class='v MT3_8' data-id='MT3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let your life, then, prove your repentance; </span>
<span class='v MT3_9' data-id='MT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and do not think that you can say amongst yourselves ‘Abraham is our ancestor,’ for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! </span>
<span class='v MT3_10' data-id='MT3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Already the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. </span>
<span class='v MT3_11' data-id='MT3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I, indeed, baptise you with water to teach repentance; but he who is coming after me is more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to carry his sandals. He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. </span>
<span class='v MT3_12' data-id='MT3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing-floor, and store his grain in the barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_13' data-id='MT3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptised by him. </span>
<span class='v MT3_14' data-id='MT3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But John tried to prevent him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_14' data-id='MT3_14'>“I need to be baptised by you,” he said, “so why have you come to me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_15' data-id='MT3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“This is the way it should be for now,”</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“because we should do everything that God requires.”</span> So John agreed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_16' data-id='MT3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>After the baptism of Jesus, and just as he came up from the water, the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and resting on him, </span>
<span class='v MT3_17' data-id='MT3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and from the heavens there came a voice which said, “This is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy.” </span></div></div>
