<span class='v T14_1' data-id='T14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit distinctly says that in later times there will be some who will fall away from the faith, and devote their attention to misleading spirits, and to the teaching of demons, </span>
<span class='v T14_2' data-id='T14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>who will make use of the hypocrisy of lying teachers. These people's consciences are seared, </span>
<span class='v T14_3' data-id='T14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and they discourage marriage and enjoin abstinence from certain kinds of food; though God created these foods to be enjoyed thankfully by those who hold the faith and have attained a full knowledge of the truth. </span>

<span class='v T14_7' data-id='T14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for profane legends and old wives' tales, leave them alone. Train yourself to lead a religious life; </span>
<span class='v T14_8' data-id='T14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>for while the training of the body is of service in some respects, religion is of service in all, carrying with it, as it does, a promise of life both here and hereafter. </span>
<span class='v T14_9' data-id='T14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>How true that saying is and worthy of the fullest acceptance! </span>
<span class='v T14_10' data-id='T14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>With that aim we toil and struggle, for we have set our hopes on the living God, who is the Saviour of all, and especially of those who hold the faith. </span></div>
