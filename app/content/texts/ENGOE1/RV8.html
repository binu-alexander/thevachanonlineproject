<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_1' data-id='RV8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As soon as the Lamb had broken the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for, it might be, half an hour. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Vision of Seven Trumpet-Blasts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_2' data-id='RV8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_3' data-id='RV8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Next, another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer in his hand; and a great quantity of incense was given to him, to mingle with the prayers of all Christ's people on the golden altar before the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV8_4' data-id='RV8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The smoke of the incense ascended, with the prayers of Christ's people, from the hand of the angel before God. </span>
<span class='v RV8_5' data-id='RV8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down on the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, cries, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. </span>
<span class='v RV8_6' data-id='RV8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow their blasts. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_7' data-id='RV8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The first blew; and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it fell on the earth. A third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third of the trees, and every blade of grass. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_8' data-id='RV8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the second angel blew; and what appeared to be a great mountain, burning, was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood, </span>
<span class='v RV8_9' data-id='RV8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and a third part of all created things that are in the sea — that is, of all living things — died, and a third of the ships was destroyed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_10' data-id='RV8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the third angel blew; and there fell from the heavens a great star, burning like a torch. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs. </span>
<span class='v RV8_11' data-id='RV8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>(The star is called ‘Wormwood.’) A third of the water became bitter as wormwood, and so bitter was the water that many died from drinking it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_12' data-id='RV8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the fourth angel blew; and a third of the sun and a third of the moon and a third of the stars were blasted, so that a third of them was eclipsed, and for a third part of the day there was no light, and at night it was the same. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV8_13' data-id='RV8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And, in my vision, I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven and crying in a loud voice — ‘Woe, woe, woe for all who live on the earth, at the other trumpet-blasts of the three angels who have yet to blow.’ </span></div></div>
