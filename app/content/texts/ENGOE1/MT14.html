<span class='v MT14_1' data-id='MT14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Prince Herod heard of the fame of Jesus, </span>
<span class='v MT14_2' data-id='MT14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and said to his attendants, “This must be John the Baptist; he must be risen from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are active in him.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_3' data-id='MT14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Herod had arrested John, put him in chains, and shut him up in prison, to please Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother Philip. </span>
<span class='v MT14_4' data-id='MT14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For John had said to him ‘You have no right to be living with her.’ </span>
<span class='v MT14_5' data-id='MT14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Yet, though Herod wanted to put him to death, he was afraid of the people, because they looked on John as a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MT14_6' data-id='MT14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But, when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before his guests, and so pleased Herod, </span>
<span class='v MT14_7' data-id='MT14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. </span>
<span class='v MT14_8' data-id='MT14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Prompted by her mother, the girl said ‘Give me here, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.’ </span>
<span class='v MT14_9' data-id='MT14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The king was distressed at this; yet, because of his oath and of the guests at his table, he ordered it to be given her. </span>
<span class='v MT14_10' data-id='MT14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He had John beheaded in the prison </span>
<span class='v MT14_11' data-id='MT14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and his head was brought on a dish and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MT14_12' data-id='MT14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then John's disciples came, and took the body away, and buried it; and went and told Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_13' data-id='MT14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard of it, he left privately in a boat to a lonely spot. The people, however, heard of his going, and followed him in crowds from the towns on foot. </span>
<span class='v MT14_14' data-id='MT14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>On getting out of the boat, Jesus saw a great crowd, and his heart was moved at the sight of them; and he cured all the sick amongst them. </span>
<span class='v MT14_15' data-id='MT14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>In the evening the disciples came up to him, and said, “This is a lonely spot, and the day is now far advanced; send the crowds away so that they can to the villages, and buy themselves food.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_16' data-id='MT14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“They need not go away, it is for you to give them something to eat.”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_17' data-id='MT14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“We have nothing here,” they said, “except five loaves and two fish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_18' data-id='MT14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“Bring them here to me,”</span> was his reply. </span>
<span class='v MT14_19' data-id='MT14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus ordered the people to take their seats on the grass; and, taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven, and said the blessing, and, after he had broken the loaves, gave them to his disciples; and they gave them to the crowds. </span>
<span class='v MT14_20' data-id='MT14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Everyone had sufficient to eat, and they picked up enough of the broken pieces that were left to fill twelve baskets. </span>
<span class='v MT14_21' data-id='MT14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The men who ate were about five thousand in number, without counting women and children. </span>
<span class='v MT14_22' data-id='MT14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Immediately afterward Jesus made the disciples get into a boat and cross over in advance of him, while he dismissed the crowds. </span>
<span class='v MT14_23' data-id='MT14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>After dismissing the crowds, he went up the hill by himself to pray; and, when evening fell, he was there alone. </span>
<span class='v MT14_24' data-id='MT14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The boat was by this time some miles from shore, labouring in the waves, for the wind was against her. </span>
<span class='v MT14_25' data-id='MT14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Three hours after midnight, however, Jesus came towards the disciples, walking on the water. </span>
<span class='v MT14_26' data-id='MT14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But, when they saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. “It is a ghost,” they exclaimed, and cried out in fear. </span>
<span class='v MT14_27' data-id='MT14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus at once spoke to them. <span class='wj'>“Courage!”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“It is I; do not be afraid!”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_28' data-id='MT14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Master,” Peter exclaimed, “if it is you, tell me to come to you on the water.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Come.”</span> So Peter got down from the boat, and walked on the water, and went towards Jesus; </span>
<span class='v MT14_30' data-id='MT14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>but, when he felt the wind, he was frightened, and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Master! Save me!” </span>
<span class='v MT14_31' data-id='MT14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Instantly Jesus stretched out his hand, and caught hold of him. <span class='wj'>“You of little faith!”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“Why did you falter?”</span> </span>
<span class='v MT14_32' data-id='MT14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>When they had got into the boat, the wind dropped. </span>
<span class='v MT14_33' data-id='MT14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But the men in the boat threw themselves on their faces before him, and said, “You are indeed God's Son.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_34' data-id='MT14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. </span>
<span class='v MT14_35' data-id='MT14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But the people of that place, recognising Jesus, sent out to the whole country around, and brought to him all who were ill, </span>
<span class='v MT14_36' data-id='MT14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>begging him merely to let them touch the tassel of his cloak; and all who touched were made perfectly well. </span></div></div>
