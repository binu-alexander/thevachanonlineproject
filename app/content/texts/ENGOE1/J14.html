<div class='s'>True and False Inspiration </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_1' data-id='J14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_2' data-id='J14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is the way to recognise the Spirit of God: those who acknowledge Jesus Christ as come in the flesh have God's Spirit, </span>
<span class='v J14_3' data-id='J14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>while a spirit that doesn't acknowledge Jesus isn't from God. Instead it is the spirit of the antichrist; you have heard that it was coming, and it is now already in the world! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_4' data-id='J14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You, my children, come from God, and you have successfully resisted such people as these, because he who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_5' data-id='J14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Those people belong to the world and therefore they speak as the world speaks, and the world listens to them. </span>
<span class='v J14_6' data-id='J14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We come from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; the person who does not come from God does not listen to us. This is how we distinguish the spirit of truth and the spirit of deception. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God is love </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_7' data-id='J14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, let us love one another, because love comes from God and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. </span>
<span class='v J14_8' data-id='J14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Those who do not love know nothing of God, for God is love. </span>
<span class='v J14_9' data-id='J14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This is how God showed his love amongst us: he sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. </span>
<span class='v J14_10' data-id='J14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This is what love is: it is not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_11' data-id='J14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, since God loved us in this way, we should love one another. </span>
<span class='v J14_12' data-id='J14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>No one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us and his love reaches perfection within us. </span>
<span class='v J14_13' data-id='J14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>We know that we live in him, and he lives in us, because he has given us a measure of his Spirit. </span>
<span class='v J14_14' data-id='J14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Moreover, we have seen for ourselves and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_15' data-id='J14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whoever acknowledges that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they live in God. </span>
<span class='v J14_16' data-id='J14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And so we have come to know and believe the love which God has for us. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_16' data-id='J14_16'>God is love; and whoever lives in love lives in God, and God lives in them. </span>
<span class='v J14_17' data-id='J14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This is the way love has reached its perfection amongst us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgement, because in this world we are like Christ. </span>
<span class='v J14_18' data-id='J14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There is no fear in love; perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. So anyone who is afraid has not reached perfection in love. </span>
<span class='v J14_19' data-id='J14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We love, because God first loved us. </span>
<span class='v J14_20' data-id='J14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>If someone says ‘I love God,’ and yet hates others, they are a liar. For the person who does not love their brother or sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen. </span>
<span class='v J14_21' data-id='J14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Indeed, we have this command from Christ: Those who love God must also love each other. </span></div></div>
