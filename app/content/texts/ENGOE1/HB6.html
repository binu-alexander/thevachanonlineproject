<div class='c'>6</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_1' data-id='HB6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, let us leave behind the elementary teaching about the Christ and press on to perfection, not always laying over again a foundation of repentance for a lifeless formality, of faith in God — </span>
<span class='v HB6_2' data-id='HB6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>teaching concerning baptisms and the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead and a final judgement. </span>
<span class='v HB6_3' data-id='HB6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yes and, with God's help, we will. </span>
<span class='v HB6_4' data-id='HB6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For if those who were once for all brought into the light, and learnt to appreciate the gift from heaven, and came to share in the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v HB6_5' data-id='HB6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and learnt to appreciate the beauty of the divine message, and the new powers of the coming age — </span>
<span class='v HB6_6' data-id='HB6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>if those, I say, fell away, it would be impossible to bring them again to repentance; they would be crucifying the Son of God over again for themselves, and exposing him to open contempt. </span>
<span class='v HB6_7' data-id='HB6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Ground that drinks in the showers that from time to time fall on it, and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is tilled, receives a blessing from God; </span>
<span class='v HB6_8' data-id='HB6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but, if it bears thorns and thistles, it is regarded as worthless, it is in danger of being cursed, and its end will be the fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_9' data-id='HB6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But about you, dear friends, even though we speak in this way, we are confident of better things — of things that point to your salvation. </span>
<span class='v HB6_10' data-id='HB6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For God is not unjust; he will not forget the work that you did, and the love that you showed for his name, in sending help to your fellow Christians — as you are still doing. </span>
<span class='v HB6_11' data-id='HB6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But our great desire is that every one of you should be equally earnest to attain to a full conviction that our hope will be fulfilled, and that you should keep that hope to the end. </span>
<span class='v HB6_12' data-id='HB6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then you will not show yourselves slow to learn, but you will copy those who, through faith and patience, are now entering upon the enjoyment of God's promises. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB6_13' data-id='HB6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When God gave his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself. </span>
<span class='v HB6_14' data-id='HB6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>His words were — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB6_14' data-id='HB6_14'>‘I will assuredly bless you and increase your numbers.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB6_15' data-id='HB6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And so, after patiently waiting, Abraham obtained the fulfilment of God's promise. </span>
<span class='v HB6_16' data-id='HB6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>People, of course, swear by what is greater than themselves, and with them an oath is accepted as putting a matter beyond all dispute. </span>
<span class='v HB6_17' data-id='HB6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And therefore God, in his desire to show, with unmistakable plainness, to those who were to enter on the enjoyment of what he had promised, the unchangeableness of his purpose, bound himself with an oath. </span>
<span class='v HB6_18' data-id='HB6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For he intended us to find great encouragement in these two unchangeable things, which make it impossible for God to prove false — we, I mean, who fled for safety where we might lay hold on the hope set before us. </span>
<span class='v HB6_19' data-id='HB6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>This hope is an anchor for our souls, secure and strong, and it reaches into the sanctuary that lies behind the curtain, </span>
<span class='v HB6_20' data-id='HB6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>where Jesus, our forerunner, has entered on our behalf, after being made for all time a high priest of the order of Melchizedek. </span></div></div>
