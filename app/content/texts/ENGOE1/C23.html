<span class='v C23_1' data-id='C23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or are we like some who need letters of commendation to you, or from you? </span>
<span class='v C23_2' data-id='C23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves are our letter — a letter written on our hearts, and one which everybody can read and understand. </span>
<span class='v C23_3' data-id='C23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All can see that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, a letter written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of human hearts. </span></div>

<span class='v C23_4' data-id='C23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This, then, is the confidence in regard to God that we have gained through the Christ. </span>
<span class='v C23_5' data-id='C23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I do not mean that we are fit to form any judgement by ourselves, as if on our own authority; </span>
<span class='v C23_6' data-id='C23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>our fitness comes from God, who himself made us fit to be assistants of a new covenant, of which the substance is, not a written Law, but a Spirit. For the written Law means death, but the Spirit gives life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_7' data-id='C23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If the system of religion which involved death, embodied in a written Law and engraved on stones, began amid such glory, that the Israelites were unable to gaze at the face of Moses because of its glory, though it was but a passing glory, </span>
<span class='v C23_8' data-id='C23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>will not the religion that confers the Spirit have still greater glory? </span>
<span class='v C23_9' data-id='C23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For, if there was a glory in the religion that involved condemnation, far greater is the glory of the religion that confers righteousness! </span>
<span class='v C23_10' data-id='C23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, that which then had glory has lost its glory, because of the glory which surpasses it. </span>
<span class='v C23_11' data-id='C23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And, if that which was to pass away was attended with glory, far more will that which is to endure be surrounded with glory! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_12' data-id='C23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>With such a hope as this, we speak with all plainness; </span>
<span class='v C23_13' data-id='C23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>unlike Moses, who covered his face with a veil, to prevent the Israelites from gazing at the disappearance of what was passing away. </span>
<span class='v C23_14' data-id='C23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But their minds were slow to learn. Indeed, to this very day, at the public reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; only for those who are in union with Christ does it pass away. </span>
<span class='v C23_15' data-id='C23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But, even to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their hearts. </span>
<span class='v C23_16' data-id='C23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Yet, whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. </span>
<span class='v C23_17' data-id='C23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the Lord is the Spirit, and, where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. </span>
<span class='v C23_18' data-id='C23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And all of us, with faces from which the veil is lifted, seeing, as if reflected in a mirror, the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into his likeness, from glory to glory, as it is given by the Lord, the Spirit. </span></div></div>
