<span class='v JH1_1' data-id='JH1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This message from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jonah, the son of Amittai: </span>
<span class='v JH1_2' data-id='JH1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Arise, go to that great city, Nineveh, and preach against it; for their wickedness is known to me.” </span>
<span class='v JH1_3' data-id='JH1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Jonah started to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JH1_4' data-id='JH1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> made a furious wind blow over the sea, and there was such a great storm that the ship was in danger of breaking to pieces. </span>
<span class='v JH1_5' data-id='JH1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The sailors were terrified and each cried for help to his own god. They threw the ship's cargo into the sea to make the ship lighter. Meanwhile Jonah had gone down into the bottom of the ship and lay fast asleep. </span>
<span class='v JH1_6' data-id='JH1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The captain of the ship went and said to him, “How can you sleep? Call on your god; perhaps that god will think of us, so that we may not be lost.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH1_7' data-id='JH1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The sailors said to one another, “Come, let us cast lots to discover on whose account this evil has come upon us.” So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah. </span>
<span class='v JH1_8' data-id='JH1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So they said to him, “Are you to blame for this? Tell us, what is your business, and where do you come from? What is your country and to what people do you belong?” </span>
<span class='v JH1_9' data-id='JH1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He replied, “I am a Hebrew, and a worshipper of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” </span>
<span class='v JH1_10' data-id='JH1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the men were greatly frightened and said to him, “What have you done?” For they knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, because he had told them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH1_11' data-id='JH1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then they said to him, “What should we do to you, to make the sea calm for us?” For the sea grew more and more stormy. </span>
<span class='v JH1_12' data-id='JH1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Take me up and throw me into the sea, and the sea will be calm for you, for I know that it is because of me this fierce storm has overtaken you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH1_13' data-id='JH1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But instead the men rowed hard to get back to the land; they could not, however, for the sea grew more and more stormy ahead. </span>
<span class='v JH1_14' data-id='JH1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So they cried to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, “We beg you, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, we beg you, don't let us die for this man's life, and don't let us be guilty of shedding innocent blood, for you are the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; you have done as it pleases you.” </span>
<span class='v JH1_15' data-id='JH1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they took up Jonah, and threw him into the sea; and the sea became calm. </span>
<span class='v JH1_16' data-id='JH1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the men greatly feared the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and they offered a sacrifice and made vows to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH1_17' data-id='JH1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights. </span></div></div>
