<span class='v ZC1_1' data-id='ZC1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the eighth month in the second year of Darius, this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_2' data-id='ZC1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was furious with your ancestors. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_3' data-id='ZC1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So tell the people this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts: “Return to me,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, “and I will return to you” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_4' data-id='ZC1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Do not be like your ancestors to whom the former prophets cried, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts says to turn now from your evil ways, and from your evil deeds’. They did not heed nor listen to me,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_5' data-id='ZC1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Your ancestors, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? </span>
<span class='v ZC1_6' data-id='ZC1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But did not my words and my statutes with which I charged my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? And they repented and said, ‘Just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts planned to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our deeds, so he has dealt with us.’ ” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC1_7' data-id='ZC1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, this message of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_8' data-id='ZC1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I saw in the night a man on a red horse, amongst the myrtle trees that were in the valley-bottom. Behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_9' data-id='ZC1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then said I, “My Lord, what are these?” And the messenger who was talking with me said, “I will show you what they are.” </span>
<span class='v ZC1_10' data-id='ZC1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the man who was standing amongst the myrtle trees answered, “They are those whom the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has sent to patrol the earth.” </span>
<span class='v ZC1_11' data-id='ZC1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the riders answered the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> who was standing amongst the myrtle trees, “We have gone up and down through the world and behold, all the earth is still and at peace.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_12' data-id='ZC1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “<span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, how long will you have no pity for Jerusalem and the cities of Judah with which you have been angry for seventy years?” </span>
<span class='v ZC1_13' data-id='ZC1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered the messenger who was talking with me with kind and comforting words. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_14' data-id='ZC1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the messenger who was talking with me said to me, “Proclaim now that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts says: I am deeply concerned for Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_15' data-id='ZC1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But I am deeply angry with the arrogant, complacent nations. I was only a little angry with Israel but they made the suffering worse. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_16' data-id='ZC1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Therefore, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I am turning to show mercy to Jerusalem. My temple will be rebuilt in it, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts, and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_17' data-id='ZC1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Proclaim again: Thus says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.” </span></div>

<span class='v ZC1_18' data-id='ZC1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now I looked up and saw four horns. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_19' data-id='ZC1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I said to the messenger who was talking with me, “What are these?” He answered, “These are the horns which scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_20' data-id='ZC1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> showed me four smiths. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_21' data-id='ZC1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I said, “What are these coming to do?” He answered, “The horns scattered Judah, so that no one dared lift their head. But the smiths have come to terrify them, to crush the horns of the nations which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter its people.” </span></div></div>
