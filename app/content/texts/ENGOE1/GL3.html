<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_1' data-id='GL3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Foolish Galatians! Who has been fascinating you — you before whose eyes Jesus Christ was depicted on the cross? </span>
<span class='v GL3_2' data-id='GL3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Here is the one thing that I want to find out from you — Did you receive the Spirit as the result of obedience to Law, or of your having listened with faith? </span>
<span class='v GL3_3' data-id='GL3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Can you be so foolish? After beginning with what is spiritual, do you now end with what is external? </span>
<span class='v GL3_4' data-id='GL3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Did you go through so much to no purpose? — if indeed it really was to no purpose! </span>
<span class='v GL3_5' data-id='GL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He who supplies you abundantly with his Spirit and endows you with such powers — does he do this as the result of obedience to Law? Or as the result of your having listened with faith? </span>
<span class='v GL3_6' data-id='GL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It is just as it was with Abraham — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_6' data-id='GL3_6'>he had faith in God, and his faith was regarded by God as righteousness. </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_7' data-id='GL3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You see, then, that those whose lives are based on faith are the sons of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GL3_8' data-id='GL3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And scripture, foreseeing that God would pronounce the Gentiles righteous as the result of faith, foretold the good news to Abraham in the words — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_8' data-id='GL3_8'>‘Through you all the Gentiles will be blessed.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_9' data-id='GL3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And, therefore, those whose lives are based on faith share the blessings bestowed on the faith of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GL3_10' data-id='GL3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>All who rely on obedience to Law are under a curse, for scripture says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_10' data-id='GL3_10'>‘Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all that is written in the book of the Law, and do it.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_11' data-id='GL3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Again, it is evident that no one is pronounced righteous before God through Law, for we read — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_11' data-id='GL3_11'>‘Through faith the righteous will find life.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_12' data-id='GL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the Law is not based on faith; no, its words are — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_12' data-id='GL3_12'>‘Those who practise these precepts will find life through them.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_13' data-id='GL3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Christ ransomed us from the curse pronounced in the Law, by taking the curse on himself for us, for scripture says — </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL3_13' data-id='GL3_13'>‘Cursed is anyone who is hanged on a tree.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL3_14' data-id='GL3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And this he did that the blessing given to Abraham might be extended to the Gentiles through their union with Jesus Christ; that so, through our faith, we also might receive the promised gift of the Spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_15' data-id='GL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To take an illustration, friends, from daily life — No one sets aside even an agreement between two people, when once it has been confirmed, nor do they add conditions to it. </span>
<span class='v GL3_16' data-id='GL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now it was to Abraham that the promises were made, ‘and to his offspring.’ It was not said ‘to his offsprings,’ as if many persons were meant, but the words were ‘to your offspring,’ showing that one person was meant — and that was Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_17' data-id='GL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>My point is this — An agreement already confirmed by God cannot be cancelled by the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, so as to cause the promise to be set aside. </span>
<span class='v GL3_18' data-id='GL3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If our heritage is the result of Law, then it has ceased to be the result of a promise. Yet God conferred it on Abraham by a promise. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_19' data-id='GL3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>What, then, you ask, was the use of the Law? It was a later addition, to make people conscious of their wrong-doings, and intended to last only until the coming of that offspring to whom the promise had been made; and it was delivered through angels by a mediator. </span>
<span class='v GL3_20' data-id='GL3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now mediation implies more than one person, but God is one only. </span>
<span class='v GL3_21' data-id='GL3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Does that set the Law in opposition to God's promises? Heaven forbid! For, if a Law had been given capable of bestowing life, then righteousness would have actually owed its existence to Law. </span>
<span class='v GL3_22' data-id='GL3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the words of scripture represent the whole world as being in bondage to sin, so that the promised blessing, dependent, as it is, on faith in Jesus Christ, may be given to those who have faith in him. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_23' data-id='GL3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Before the coming of faith, we were kept under the guard of the Law, in bondage, awaiting the faith that was destined to be revealed. </span>
<span class='v GL3_24' data-id='GL3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Thus the Law has proved a guide to lead us to Christ, in order that we may be pronounced righteous as the result of faith. </span>
<span class='v GL3_25' data-id='GL3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But now that faith has come we no longer need a guide. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_26' data-id='GL3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For you are all sons of God, through your faith in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v GL3_27' data-id='GL3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For all of you who were baptised into union with Christ clothed yourselves with Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_28' data-id='GL3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>All distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, male and female, have vanished; for in union with Christ Jesus you are all one. </span>
<span class='v GL3_29' data-id='GL3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And, since you belong to Christ, it follows that you are Abraham's offspring and, under the promise, sharers in the inheritance. </span></div></div>
