<span class='v JN7_1' data-id='JN7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went about in Galilee, for he would not do so in Judea, because the religious authorities (in Jerusalem) were eager to put him to death. </span>
<span class='v JN7_2' data-id='JN7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, </span>
<span class='v JN7_3' data-id='JN7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>his brothers said to him, “Leave this part of the country, and go into Judea, so that your disciples, as well as we, may see the work that you are doing. </span>
<span class='v JN7_4' data-id='JN7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For no one does a thing privately, if they are seeking to be widely known. Since you do these things, you should show yourself publicly to the world.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_5' data-id='JN7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For even his brothers did not believe in him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_6' data-id='JN7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“My time,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“is not come yet, but your time is always here.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_7' data-id='JN7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I testify that its ways are evil.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_8' data-id='JN7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Go yourselves up to the Festival; I am not going to this Festival yet, because my time has not yet come.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_9' data-id='JN7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After telling them this, he stayed on in Galilee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_10' data-id='JN7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But, when his brothers had gone up to the Festival, Jesus also went up — not publicly, but privately. </span>
<span class='v JN7_11' data-id='JN7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The authorities were looking for him at the Festival and asking ‘Where is he?’; </span>
<span class='v JN7_12' data-id='JN7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and there were many whispers about him amongst the people, some saying ‘He is a good man;’ others, ‘No! He is leading the people astray.’ </span>
<span class='v JN7_13' data-id='JN7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>No one, however, spoke freely about him, because they were afraid of the authorities. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_14' data-id='JN7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>About the middle of the Festival week, Jesus went up into the Temple Courts, and began teaching. </span>
<span class='v JN7_15' data-id='JN7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The authorities were astonished. “How has this man got his learning,” they asked, “when he has never studied?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_16' data-id='JN7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So, in reply, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“My teaching is not my own; it is his who sent me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_17' data-id='JN7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>If anyone has the will to do God's will, they will find out whether my teaching is from God, or whether I speak on my own authority.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_18' data-id='JN7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>The person who speaks on their own authority seeks honour for themselves; but the one who seeks the honour of him who sent him is sincere, and there is nothing false in him.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_19' data-id='JN7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Was not it Moses who gave you the Law? Yet not one of you obeys it! Why are you seeking to put me to death?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_20' data-id='JN7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“You must be possessed by a demon!” the people exclaimed. “Who is seeking to put you to death?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_21' data-id='JN7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>“There was one thing I did,”</span> replied Jesus, <span class='wj'>“at which you are all still wondering.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_22' data-id='JN7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>But that is why Moses has instituted circumcision amongst you — not, indeed, that it began with him, but with our ancestors — and that is why you circumcise even on a Sabbath.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_23' data-id='JN7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>When a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath to prevent the Law of Moses from being broken, how can you be angry with me for making a man sound and well on a Sabbath?</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_24' data-id='JN7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Do not judge by appearances; judge justly.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_25' data-id='JN7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At this some of the people of Jerusalem exclaimed, “Is not this the man who they are seeking to put to death? </span>
<span class='v JN7_26' data-id='JN7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Yet here he is, speaking out boldly, and they say nothing to him! Is it possible that our leading men have really discovered that he is the Christ? </span>
<span class='v JN7_27' data-id='JN7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Yet we know where this man is from; but, when the Christ comes, no one will be able to tell where he is from.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_28' data-id='JN7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore, Jesus, as he was teaching in the Temple Courts, raised his voice and said, <span class='wj'>“Yes; you know me and you know where I am from. Yet I have not come on my own authority, but he who sent me may be trusted; and him you do not know.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_29' data-id='JN7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I do know him, for it is from him that I have come, and he sent me as his messenger.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_30' data-id='JN7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So they sought to arrest him; but no one touched him, for his time was not come yet. </span>
<span class='v JN7_31' data-id='JN7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Many of the people, however, believed in him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will he give more signs of his mission than this man has given?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_32' data-id='JN7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the people whispering about him in this way, and so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him; </span>
<span class='v JN7_33' data-id='JN7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>at which Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I will be with you but a little longer, and then I am going to him who sent me.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_34' data-id='JN7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_35' data-id='JN7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“Where is this man going,” the people asked one another, “that we would not find him? Will he go to our countrymen abroad, and teach foreigners? </span>
<span class='v JN7_36' data-id='JN7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>What does he mean by saying <span class='wj'>‘You will look for me, and you will not find me; and you will not be able to come where I will be’?”</span> </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_37' data-id='JN7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>On the last and greatest day of the Festival, Jesus, who was standing by, exclaimed, <span class='wj'>“If anyone thirsts, they should come to me, and drink.</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_38' data-id='JN7_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>I tell you what I have myself seen in the presence of my Father; and you, in the same way, do what you have learnt from your father.”</span> </span>
<span class='v JN7_39' data-id='JN7_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>(By this he meant the Spirit, which those who had believed in him were to receive; for the Spirit had not yet come, because Jesus had not yet been exalted.) </span>
<span class='v JN7_40' data-id='JN7_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Some of the people, when they heard these words, said, “This is certainly the Prophet!”; </span>
<span class='v JN7_41' data-id='JN7_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>others said, “the Christ!”; but some asked, “What! Does the Christ come from Galilee? </span>
<span class='v JN7_42' data-id='JN7_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Is not it said in scripture that it is of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village to which David belonged, that the Christ is to come?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_43' data-id='JN7_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>So there was a sharp division amongst the people because of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN7_44' data-id='JN7_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Some of them wanted to arrest him, and yet no one touched him. </span>
<span class='v JN7_45' data-id='JN7_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, they were asked, “Why have you not brought him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_46' data-id='JN7_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“No one ever spoke as he speaks!” they answered. </span>
<span class='v JN7_47' data-id='JN7_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>“What! Have you been led astray too?” the Pharisees replied. </span>
<span class='v JN7_48' data-id='JN7_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>“Have any of our leading men believed in him, or any of the Pharisees? </span>
<span class='v JN7_49' data-id='JN7_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>As for these people who do not know the Law — they are cursed!” </span>
<span class='v JN7_50' data-id='JN7_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>But one of their number, Nicodemus, who before this had been to see Jesus, said to them, </span>
<span class='v JN7_51' data-id='JN7_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>“Does our Law pass judgement on a person without first giving them a hearing, and finding out what they have been doing?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_52' data-id='JN7_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>“Are you also from Galilee?” they retorted. “Search, and you will find that no prophet is to arise in Galilee!” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_53' data-id='JN7_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And everyone went home </span></div></div>
