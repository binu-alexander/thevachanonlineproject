<span class='v NU17_1' data-id='NU17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU17_2' data-id='NU17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Say to the children of Israel that they are to give you rods, one for every family, for every chief, the head of his father's house, making twelve rods; let every man's name be placed on his rod. </span>
<span class='v NU17_3' data-id='NU17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And let Aaron's name be placed on the rod of Levi: for there is to be one rod for the head of every family. </span>
<span class='v NU17_4' data-id='NU17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And let them be stored up in the Tent of meeting, in front of the ark of witness where I come to you. </span>
<span class='v NU17_5' data-id='NU17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the rod of that man who is marked out by me for myself will have buds on it; so I will put a stop to the outcries which the children of Israel make to me against you. </span>
<span class='v NU17_6' data-id='NU17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Moses gave these orders to the children of Israel, and all their chiefs gave him rods, one for the head of every family, making twelve rods: and Aaron's rod was among them. </span>
<span class='v NU17_7' data-id='NU17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Moses put the rods before the Lord in the Tent of witness. </span>
<span class='v NU17_8' data-id='NU17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now on the day after, Moses went into the Tent of witness; and he saw that Aaron's rod, the rod of the house of Levi, had put out buds, and was covered with buds and flowers and fruit. </span>
<span class='v NU17_9' data-id='NU17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Moses took out all the rods from before the Lord, and gave them back to the children of Israel: and they saw them, and every man took his rod. </span>
<span class='v NU17_10' data-id='NU17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Put Aaron's rod back in front of the ark of witness, to be kept for a sign against this false-hearted people, so that you may put a stop to their outcries against me, and death may not overtake them. </span>
<span class='v NU17_11' data-id='NU17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This Moses did: as the Lord gave orders, so he did. </span>
<span class='v NU17_12' data-id='NU17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel said to Moses, Truly, destruction has come on us; an evil fate has overtaken us all. </span>
<span class='v NU17_13' data-id='NU17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Death will overtake everyone who comes near, who comes near the House of the Lord: are we all to come to destruction? </span></div></div>
