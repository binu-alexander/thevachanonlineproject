<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_1' data-id='EK23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK23_2' data-id='EK23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother: </span>
<span class='v EK23_3' data-id='EK23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They were acting like loose women in Egypt; when they were young their behaviour was loose: there their breasts were crushed, even the points of their young breasts were crushed. </span>
<span class='v EK23_4' data-id='EK23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Their names were Oholah, the older, and Oholibah, her sister: and they became mine, and gave birth to sons and daughters. As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem, Oholibah. </span>
<span class='v EK23_5' data-id='EK23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Oholah was untrue to me when she was mine; she was full of desire for her lovers, even for the Assyrians, her neighbours, </span>
<span class='v EK23_6' data-id='EK23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who were clothed in blue, captains and rulers, all of them young men to be desired, horsemen seated on horses. </span>
<span class='v EK23_7' data-id='EK23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And she gave her unclean love to them, all of them the noblest men of Assyria: and she made herself unclean with the images of all who were desired by her. </span>
<span class='v EK23_8' data-id='EK23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And she has not given up her loose ways from the time when she was in Egypt; for when she was young they were her lovers, and by them her young breasts were crushed, and they let loose on her their unclean desire. </span>
<span class='v EK23_9' data-id='EK23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this cause I gave her up into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians on whom her desire was fixed. </span>
<span class='v EK23_10' data-id='EK23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>By these her shame was uncovered: they took her sons and daughters and put her to death with the sword: and she became a cause of wonder to women; for they gave her the punishment which was right. </span>
<span class='v EK23_11' data-id='EK23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And her sister Oholibah saw this, but her desire was even more unmeasured, and her loose behaviour was worse than that of her sister. </span>
<span class='v EK23_12' data-id='EK23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>She was full of desire for the Assyrians, captains and rulers, her neighbours, clothed in blue, horsemen going on horses, all of them young men to be desired. </span>
<span class='v EK23_13' data-id='EK23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I saw that she had become unclean; the two of them went the same way. </span>
<span class='v EK23_14' data-id='EK23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And her loose behaviour became worse; for she saw men pictured on a wall, pictures of the Chaldaeans painted in bright red, </span>
<span class='v EK23_15' data-id='EK23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>With bands round their bodies and with head-dresses hanging round their heads, all of them looking like rulers, like the Babylonians, the land of whose birth is Chaldaea. </span>
<span class='v EK23_16' data-id='EK23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And when she saw them she was full of desire for them, and sent servants to them in Chaldaea. </span>
<span class='v EK23_17' data-id='EK23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and made her unclean with their loose desire, and she became unclean with them, and her soul was turned from them. </span>
<span class='v EK23_18' data-id='EK23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So her loose behaviour was clearly seen and her shame uncovered: then my soul was turned from her as it had been turned from her sister. </span>
<span class='v EK23_19' data-id='EK23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But still she went on the more with her loose behaviour, keeping in mind the early days when she had been a loose woman in the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EK23_20' data-id='EK23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And she was full of desire for her lovers, whose flesh is like the flesh of asses and whose seed is like the seed of horses. </span>
<span class='v EK23_21' data-id='EK23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And she made the memory of the loose ways of her early years come back to mind, when her young breasts were crushed by the Egyptians. </span>
<span class='v EK23_22' data-id='EK23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For this cause, O Oholibah, this is what the Lord has said: See, I will make your lovers come up against you, even those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust; and I will make them come up against you on every side; </span>
<span class='v EK23_23' data-id='EK23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: young men to be desired, captains and rulers all of them, and chiefs, her neighbours, all of them on horseback. </span>
<span class='v EK23_24' data-id='EK23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they will come against you from the north on horseback, with war-carriages and a great band of peoples; they will put themselves in order against you with breastplate and body-cover and metal head-dress round about you: and I will make them your judges, and they will give their decision against you as seems right to them. </span>
<span class='v EK23_25' data-id='EK23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And my bitter feeling will be working against you, and they will take you in hand with passion; they will take away your nose and your ears, and the rest of you will be put to the sword: they will take your sons and daughters, and the rest of you will be burned up in the fire. </span>
<span class='v EK23_26' data-id='EK23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And they will take all your clothing off you and take away your ornaments. </span>
<span class='v EK23_27' data-id='EK23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So I will put an end to your evil ways and your loose behaviour which came from the land of Egypt: and your eyes will never be lifted up to them again, and you will have no more memory of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EK23_28' data-id='EK23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said: See, I will give you up into the hands of those who are hated by you, into the hands of those from whom your soul is turned away in disgust: </span>
<span class='v EK23_29' data-id='EK23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And they will take you in hand with hate, and take away all the fruit of your work, and let you be unveiled and without clothing: and the shame of your loose behaviour will be uncovered, your evil designs and your loose ways. </span>
<span class='v EK23_30' data-id='EK23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They will do these things to you because you have been untrue to me, and have gone after the nations, and have become unclean with their images. </span>
<span class='v EK23_31' data-id='EK23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>You have gone in the way of your sister; and I will give her cup into your hand. </span>
<span class='v EK23_32' data-id='EK23_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord has said: You will take a drink from your sister's cup, which is deep and wide: you will be laughed at and looked down on, more than you are able to undergo. </span>
<span class='v EK23_33' data-id='EK23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>You will be broken and full of sorrow, with the cup of wonder and destruction, with the cup of your sister Samaria. </span>
<span class='v EK23_34' data-id='EK23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And after drinking it and draining it out, you will take the last drops of it to the end, pulling off your breasts: for I have said it, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK23_35' data-id='EK23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So this is what the Lord has said: Because you have not kept me in your memory, and because your back has been turned to me, you will even undergo the punishment of your evil designs and your loose ways. </span>
<span class='v EK23_36' data-id='EK23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord said to me: Son of man, will you be the judge of Oholibah? then make clear to her the disgusting things she has done. </span>
<span class='v EK23_37' data-id='EK23_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>For she has been false to me, and blood is on her hands, and with her images she has been untrue; and more than this, she made her sons, whom she had by me, go through the fire to them to be burned up. </span>
<span class='v EK23_38' data-id='EK23_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Further, this is what she has done to me: she has made my holy place unclean and has made my Sabbaths unclean. </span>
<span class='v EK23_39' data-id='EK23_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>For when she had made an offering of her children to her images, she came into my holy place to make it unclean; see, this is what she has done inside my house. </span>
<span class='v EK23_40' data-id='EK23_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And she even sent for men to come from far away, to whom a servant was sent, and they came: for whom she was washing her body and painting her eyes and making herself fair with ornaments. </span>
<span class='v EK23_41' data-id='EK23_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And she took her seat on a great bed, with a table put ready before it on which she put my perfume and my oil. </span>
<span class='v EK23_42' data-id='EK23_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> ... and they put jewels on her hands and beautiful crowns on her head. </span>
<span class='v EK23_43' data-id='EK23_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then I said ... now she will go on with her loose ways. </span>
<span class='v EK23_44' data-id='EK23_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And they went in to her, as men go to a loose woman: so they went in to Oholibah, the loose woman. </span>
<span class='v EK23_45' data-id='EK23_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And upright men will be her judges, judging her as false wives and women who take lives are judged; because she has been untrue to me and blood is on her hands. </span>
<span class='v EK23_46' data-id='EK23_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said: I will make a great meeting of the people come together against her, and will send on her shaking fear and take everything from her. </span>
<span class='v EK23_47' data-id='EK23_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And the meeting, after stoning her with stones, will put an end to her with their swords; they will put her sons and daughters to death and have her house burned up with fire. </span>
<span class='v EK23_48' data-id='EK23_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And I will put an end to evil in all the land, teaching all women not to do as you have done. </span>
<span class='v EK23_49' data-id='EK23_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And I will send on you the punishment of your evil ways, and you will be rewarded for your sins with your images: and you will be certain that I am the Lord. </span></div></div>
