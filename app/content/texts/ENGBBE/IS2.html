<span class='v IS2_3' data-id='IS2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the peoples will say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob: and he will give us knowledge of his ways, and we will be guided by his word; for out of Zion the law will go out, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v IS2_4' data-id='IS2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he will be the judge between the nations, and the peoples will be ruled by his decisions: and their swords will be turned into plough-blades, and their spears into vine-knives: no longer will the nations be turning their swords against one another, and the knowledge of war will be gone for ever. </span>
<span class='v IS2_5' data-id='IS2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>O family of Jacob, come, and let us go in the light of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS2_6' data-id='IS2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For you, O Lord, have given up your people, the family of Jacob, because they are full of the evil ways of the east, and make use of secret arts like the Philistines, and are friends with the children of strange countries. </span>
<span class='v IS2_7' data-id='IS2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their stores; their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their carriages. </span>
<span class='v IS2_8' data-id='IS2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Their land is full of images; they give worship to the work of their hands, even to that which their fingers have made. </span>
<span class='v IS2_9' data-id='IS2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the poor man's head is bent, and the great man goes down on his face: for this cause there will be no forgiveness for their sin. </span>
<span class='v IS2_10' data-id='IS2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Go into a hole in the rock, covering yourselves with dust, in fear of the Lord, before the glory of his power. </span>

<span class='v IS2_19' data-id='IS2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And men will go into cracks of the rocks, and into holes of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength. </span>
<span class='v IS2_20' data-id='IS2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In that day men will put their images of silver and of gold, which they made for worship, in the keeping of the beasts of the dark places; </span>
<span class='v IS2_21' data-id='IS2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To take cover in the cracks of the rocks, and in the holes of the hills, for fear of the Lord, and before the glory of his power, when he comes out of his place, shaking the earth with his strength. </span>
