<span class='v GN35_1' data-id='GN35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And God said to Jacob, Go up now to Beth-el and make your living-place there: and put up an altar there to the God who came to you when you were in flight from your brother Esau. </span>
<span class='v GN35_2' data-id='GN35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob said to all his people, Put away the strange gods which are among you, and make yourselves clean, and put on a change of clothing: </span>
<span class='v GN35_3' data-id='GN35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And let us go up to Beth-el: and there I will make an altar to God, who gave me an answer in the day of my trouble, and was with me wherever I went. </span>
<span class='v GN35_4' data-id='GN35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which they had, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob put them away under the holy tree at Shechem. </span>
<span class='v GN35_5' data-id='GN35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So they went on their journey: and the fear of God was on the towns round about, so that they made no attack on the sons of Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN35_6' data-id='GN35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Jacob came to Luz in the land of Canaan (which is the same as Beth-el), he and all his people. </span>
<span class='v GN35_7' data-id='GN35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And there he made an altar, naming the place El-beth-el: because it was there he had the vision of God when he was in flight from his brother. </span>
<span class='v GN35_8' data-id='GN35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Deborah, the servant who had taken care of Rebekah from her birth, came to her end, and was put to rest near Beth-el, under the holy tree: and they gave it the name of Allon-bacuth. </span>
<span class='v GN35_9' data-id='GN35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now when Jacob was on his way from Paddan-aram, God came to him again and, blessing him, said, </span>
<span class='v GN35_10' data-id='GN35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jacob is your name, but it will be so no longer; from now your name will be Israel; so he was named Israel. </span>
<span class='v GN35_11' data-id='GN35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, I am God, the Ruler of all: be fertile, and have increase; a nation, truly a group of nations, will come from you, and kings will be your offspring; </span>
<span class='v GN35_12' data-id='GN35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you; and to your seed after you I will give the land. </span>
<span class='v GN35_13' data-id='GN35_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then God went up from him in the place where he had been talking with him. </span>
<span class='v GN35_14' data-id='GN35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Jacob put up a pillar in the place where he had been talking with God, and put a drink offering on it, and oil. </span>
<span class='v GN35_15' data-id='GN35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he gave to the place where God had been talking with him, the name of Beth-el. </span>
<span class='v GN35_16' data-id='GN35_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So they went on from Beth-el; and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, the pains of birth came on Rachel and she had a hard time. </span>
<span class='v GN35_17' data-id='GN35_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when her pain was very great, the woman who was helping her said, Have no fear; for now you will have another son. </span>
<span class='v GN35_18' data-id='GN35_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And in the hour when her life went from her (for death came to her), she gave the child the name Ben-oni: but his father gave him the name of Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v GN35_19' data-id='GN35_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Rachel came to her end and was put to rest on the road to Ephrath (which is Beth-lehem). </span>
<span class='v GN35_20' data-id='GN35_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Jacob put up a pillar on her resting-place; which is named, The Pillar of the resting-place of Rachel, to this day. </span>
<span class='v GN35_21' data-id='GN35_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Israel went journeying on and put up his tents on the other side of the tower of the flock. </span>
<span class='v GN35_22' data-id='GN35_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now while they were living in that country, Reuben had connection with Bilhah, his father's servant-woman: and Israel had news of it. </span>
<span class='v GN35_23' data-id='GN35_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now Jacob had twelve sons: the sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first son, and Simeon and Levi and Judah and Issachar and Zebulun; </span>
<span class='v GN35_24' data-id='GN35_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; </span>
<span class='v GN35_25' data-id='GN35_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant: Dan and Naphtali; </span>
<span class='v GN35_26' data-id='GN35_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant: Gad and Asher; these are the sons whom Jacob had in Paddan-aram. </span>
<span class='v GN35_27' data-id='GN35_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, at Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had been living. </span>
<span class='v GN35_28' data-id='GN35_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Isaac was a hundred and eighty years old. </span>
<span class='v GN35_29' data-id='GN35_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac came to his end and was put to rest with his father's people, an old man after a long life: and Jacob and Esau, his sons, put him in his last resting-place. </span></div></div>
