<span class='v LV14_3' data-id='LV14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to go outside the tent-circle; and if, after looking, the priest sees that the mark of the disease has gone from him, </span>
<span class='v LV14_4' data-id='LV14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the priest is to give orders to take, for him who is to be made clean, two living clean birds and some cedar wood and red thread and hyssop. </span>
<span class='v LV14_5' data-id='LV14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the priest will give orders for one of the birds to be put to death in a vessel made of earth, over flowing water. </span>
<span class='v LV14_6' data-id='LV14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he will take the living bird and the wood and the red thread and the hyssop and put them in the blood of the bird which was put to death over flowing water. </span>
<span class='v LV14_7' data-id='LV14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And shaking it seven times over the man who is to be made clean, he will say that he is clean and will let the living bird go free into the open country. </span>
<span class='v LV14_8' data-id='LV14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he who is to be made clean will have his clothing washed and his hair cut and have a bath, and he will be clean. And after that he will come back to the tent-circle; but he is to keep outside his tent for seven days. </span>
<span class='v LV14_9' data-id='LV14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day he is to have all the hair cut off his head and his chin and over his eyes — all his hair is to be cut off — and he will have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and he will be clean. </span>
<span class='v LV14_10' data-id='LV14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day let him take two male lambs, without any marks on them, and one female lamb of the first year, without a mark, and three tenth parts of an ephah of the best meal, mixed with oil, and one log of oil. </span>
<span class='v LV14_11' data-id='LV14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the priest who is making him clean will put the man who is being made clean, together with these things, before the door of the Tent of meeting. </span>

<span class='v LV14_14' data-id='LV14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And let the priest take some of the blood of the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the point of the right ear of him who is to be made clean, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot; </span>

<span class='v LV14_19' data-id='LV14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the priest will give the sin-offering, and take away the sin of him who is to be made clean from his unclean condition; and after that he will put the burned offering to death. </span>
<span class='v LV14_20' data-id='LV14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to have the burned offering and the meal offering burned on the altar; and the priest will take away his sin and he will be clean. </span>

<span class='v LV14_29' data-id='LV14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the oil which is in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be made clean, to take away his sin before the Lord. </span>

<span class='v LV14_32' data-id='LV14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is the law for the man who has the disease of the leper on him, and who is not able to get that which is necessary for making himself clean. </span>
<span class='v LV14_33' data-id='LV14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, </span>
