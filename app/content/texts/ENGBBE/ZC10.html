<span class='v ZC10_1' data-id='ZC10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Make your request to the Lord for rain in the time of the spring rains, even to the Lord who makes the thunder-flames; and he will give them showers of rain, to every man grass in the field. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_2' data-id='ZC10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For the images have said what is not true, and the readers of signs have seen deceit; they have given accounts of false dreams, they give comfort to no purpose: so they go out of the way like sheep, they are troubled because they have no keeper. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_3' data-id='ZC10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>My wrath is burning against the keepers of the flock, and I will send punishment on the he-goats: for the Lord of armies takes care of his flock, the people of Judah, and will make them like the horse of his pride in the fight. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_4' data-id='ZC10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>From him will come the keystone, from him the nail, from him the bow of war, from him will come every ruler; </span>
<span class='v ZC10_5' data-id='ZC10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Together they will be like men of war, crushing down their haters into the earth of the streets in the fight; they will make war because the Lord is with them: and the horsemen will be shamed. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_6' data-id='ZC10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will make the children of Judah strong, and I will be the saviour of the children of Joseph, and I will make them come back again, for I have had mercy on them: they will be as if I had not given them up: for I am the Lord their God and I will give them an answer. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_7' data-id='ZC10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Ephraim will be like a man of war, and their hearts will be glad as with wine; and their children will see it with joy; their hearts will be glad in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_8' data-id='ZC10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>With the sound of the pipe I will get them together; for I have given the price to make them free: and they will be increased as they were increased. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_9' data-id='ZC10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Though I had them planted among the peoples, they will keep me in mind in far countries: and they will take care of their children and will come back. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_10' data-id='ZC10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I will make them come back out of the land of Egypt, and will get them together out of Assyria; and I will take them into the land of Gilead, and it will not be wide enough for them. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_11' data-id='ZC10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they will go through the sea of Egypt, and all the deep waters of the Nile will become dry: and the pride of Assyria will be made low, and the power of Egypt will be taken away. </span>
<span class='v ZC10_12' data-id='ZC10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And their strength will be in the Lord; and their pride will be in his name, says the Lord. </span></div></div>
