<span class='v GN6_1' data-id='GN6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And after a time, when men were increasing on the earth, and had daughters, </span>
<span class='v GN6_2' data-id='GN6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took wives for themselves from those who were pleasing to them. </span>
<span class='v GN6_3' data-id='GN6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, My spirit will not be in man for ever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years. </span>
<span class='v GN6_4' data-id='GN6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>There were men of great strength and size on the earth in those days; and after that, when the sons of God had connection with the daughters of men, they gave birth to children: these were the great men of old days, the men of great name. </span>
<span class='v GN6_5' data-id='GN6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the Lord saw that the sin of man was great on the earth, and that all the thoughts of his heart were evil. </span>
<span class='v GN6_6' data-id='GN6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord had sorrow because he had made man on the earth, and grief was in his heart. </span>
<span class='v GN6_7' data-id='GN6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, I will take away man, whom I have made, from the face of the earth, even man and beast and that which goes on the earth and every bird of the air; for I have sorrow for having made them. </span>
<span class='v GN6_8' data-id='GN6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Noah had grace in the eyes of God. </span>
<span class='v GN6_9' data-id='GN6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was an upright man and without sin in his generation: he went in the ways of God. </span>
<span class='v GN6_10' data-id='GN6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_11' data-id='GN6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the earth was evil in God's eyes and full of violent ways. </span>
<span class='v GN6_12' data-id='GN6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And God, looking on the earth, saw that it was evil: for the way of all flesh had become evil on the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_13' data-id='GN6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come; the earth is full of their violent doings, and now I will put an end to them with the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_14' data-id='GN6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood with rooms in it, and make it safe from the water inside and out. </span>
<span class='v GN6_15' data-id='GN6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And this is the way you are to make it: it is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. </span>
<span class='v GN6_16' data-id='GN6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You are to put a window in the ark, a cubit from the roof, and a door in the side of it, and you are to make it with a lower and second and third floors. </span>
<span class='v GN6_17' data-id='GN6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For truly, I will send a great flow of waters over the earth, for the destruction from under the heaven of all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything on the earth will come to an end. </span>
<span class='v GN6_18' data-id='GN6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But with you I will make an agreement; and you will come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives with you. </span>
