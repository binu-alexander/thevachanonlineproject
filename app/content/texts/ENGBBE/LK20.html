<span class='v LK20_1' data-id='LK20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And it came about on one of those days, when he was teaching the people in the Temple and preaching the good news, </span>
<span class='v LK20_2' data-id='LK20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>That the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people came to him and said, Make clear to us by what authority you do these things and who gave you this authority. </span>
<span class='v LK20_3' data-id='LK20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And in answer he said to them, I will put a question to you, and do you give me an answer: </span>
<span class='v LK20_4' data-id='LK20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men? </span>
<span class='v LK20_5' data-id='LK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they said among themselves, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why did you not have faith in him? </span>
<span class='v LK20_6' data-id='LK20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if we say, Of men; we will be stoned by the people, for they are certain that John was a prophet. </span>
<span class='v LK20_7' data-id='LK20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they made answer that they had no idea where it came from. </span>
<span class='v LK20_8' data-id='LK20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, And I will not make clear to you by what authority I do these things. </span>
<span class='v LK20_9' data-id='LK20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he gave the people this story: A man made a vine-garden and gave the use of it to some field-workers and went into another country for a long time. </span>
<span class='v LK20_10' data-id='LK20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And at the right time he sent a servant to the workers to get part of the fruit from the vines; but the workmen gave him blows and sent him away with nothing. </span>
<span class='v LK20_11' data-id='LK20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he sent another servant, and they gave blows to him in the same way, and put shame on him, and sent him away with nothing. </span>
<span class='v LK20_12' data-id='LK20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he sent a third, and they gave him wounds and put him out. </span>
<span class='v LK20_13' data-id='LK20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the lord of the garden said, What am I to do? I will send my dearly loved son; they may give respect to him. </span>
<span class='v LK20_14' data-id='LK20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But when the workmen saw him, they said to one another, This is he who will one day be the owner of the property: let us put him to death and the heritage will be ours. </span>
<span class='v LK20_15' data-id='LK20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And driving him out of the garden they put him to death. Now what will the lord do to these workmen? </span>
<span class='v LK20_16' data-id='LK20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He will come and put them to destruction and give the garden to others. And when he said this, they said, May it not be so. </span>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But he, looking on them, said, Is it not in the Writings, The stone which the builders put on one side, the same has become the chief stone of the building? </span>
<span class='v LK20_18' data-id='LK20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Everyone falling on that stone will be broken, but the man on whom the stone comes down will be crushed to dust. </span>
<span class='v LK20_19' data-id='LK20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes made attempts to get their hands on him in that very hour; and they were in fear of the people, for they saw that he had made up this story against them. </span>
<span class='v LK20_20' data-id='LK20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And they kept watch on him, and sent out secret representatives, who were acting the part of good men, in order that they might get something from his words, on account of which they might give him up to the government and into the power of the ruler. </span>
<span class='v LK20_21' data-id='LK20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they put a question to him, saying, Master, we are certain that your teaching and your words are right, and that you have no respect for a man's position, but you are teaching the true way of God: </span>
<span class='v LK20_22' data-id='LK20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Is it right for us to make payment of taxes to Caesar or not? </span>
<span class='v LK20_23' data-id='LK20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he saw through their trick and said to them, </span>
<span class='v LK20_24' data-id='LK20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Let me see a penny. Whose image and name are on it? And they said, Caesar's. </span>
<span class='v LK20_25' data-id='LK20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And he said, Then give to Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and to God the things which are God's. </span>
<span class='v LK20_26' data-id='LK20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And they were not able to get anything from these words before the people: but they were full of wonder at his answer, and said nothing. </span>
<span class='v LK20_27' data-id='LK20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And some of the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no coming back from the dead; and they said to him, </span>
<span class='v LK20_28' data-id='LK20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Master, Moses said that if a man's brother comes to his end, having a wife, but no children, his brother is to take the wife, and get a family for his brother. </span>
<span class='v LK20_29' data-id='LK20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers, and the first had a wife and came to his end, having no children; </span>
<span class='v LK20_30' data-id='LK20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the second; </span>
<span class='v LK20_31' data-id='LK20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And the third took her; and in the same way, all the seven, without having any children, came to their end. </span>
<span class='v LK20_32' data-id='LK20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And last of all, the woman came to her end. </span>
<span class='v LK20_33' data-id='LK20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When they come back from the dead, whose wife will she be? for all the seven had her. </span>
<span class='v LK20_34' data-id='LK20_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world are married and have wives; </span>
<span class='v LK20_35' data-id='LK20_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But those to whom is given the reward of the world to come, and to come back from the dead, have no wives, and are not married; </span>
<span class='v LK20_36' data-id='LK20_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And death has no more power over them, for they are equal to the angels, and are sons of God, being of those who will come back from the dead. </span>
<span class='v LK20_37' data-id='LK20_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But even Moses made it clear that the dead come back to life, saying, in the story of the burning thorn-tree, The Lord, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. </span>
<span class='v LK20_38' data-id='LK20_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Now he is not the God of the dead but of the living: for all men are living to him. </span>
<span class='v LK20_39' data-id='LK20_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And some of the scribes, in answer to this, said, Master, you have said well. </span>
<span class='v LK20_40' data-id='LK20_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And they had fear of putting any more questions to him. </span>
<span class='v LK20_41' data-id='LK20_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Why do they say that the Christ is the son of David? </span>
<span class='v LK20_42' data-id='LK20_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Take your seat at my right hand, </span>
<span class='v LK20_43' data-id='LK20_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Till I put under your feet all those who are against you. </span>
<span class='v LK20_44' data-id='LK20_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>David then gives him the name of Lord, so how is it possible for him to be his son? </span>
<span class='v LK20_45' data-id='LK20_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v LK20_46' data-id='LK20_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Keep away from the scribes, whose pleasure it is to go about in long robes, and to have words of respect said to them in the market-places, and to take the chief seats in the Synagogues and the first places at feasts; </span>
<span class='v LK20_47' data-id='LK20_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Who take the property of widows and before the eyes of men make long prayers; they will get a greater punishment. </span></div></div>
