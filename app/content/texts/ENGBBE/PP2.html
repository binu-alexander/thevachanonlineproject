<span class='v PP2_1' data-id='PP2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If then there is any comfort in Christ, any help given by love, any uniting of hearts in the Spirit, any loving mercies and pity, </span>
<span class='v PP2_2' data-id='PP2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in harmony and of one mind; </span>
<span class='v PP2_3' data-id='PP2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Doing nothing through envy or through pride, but with low thoughts of self let everyone take others to be better than himself; </span>
<span class='v PP2_4' data-id='PP2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Not looking everyone to his private good, but keeping in mind the things of others. </span>
<span class='v PP2_5' data-id='PP2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let this mind be in you which was in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v PP2_6' data-id='PP2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>To whom, though himself in the form of God, it did not seem that to take for oneself was to be like God; </span>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But he made himself as nothing, taking the form of a servant, being made like men; </span>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And being seen in form as a man, he took the lowest place, and let himself be put to death, even the death of the cross. </span>
<span class='v PP2_9' data-id='PP2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this reason God has put him in the highest place and has given to him the name which is greater than every name; </span>
<span class='v PP2_10' data-id='PP2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So that at the name of Jesus every knee may be bent, of those in heaven and those on earth and those in the underworld, </span>
<span class='v PP2_11' data-id='PP2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And that every tongue may give witness that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. </span>
<span class='v PP2_12' data-id='PP2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So then, my loved ones, as you have at all times done what I say, not only when I am present, but now much more when I am not with you, give yourselves to working out your salvation with fear in your hearts; </span>
<span class='v PP2_13' data-id='PP2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it is God who is the cause of your desires and of your acts, for his good pleasure. </span>
<span class='v PP2_14' data-id='PP2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do all things without protests and arguments; </span>
<span class='v PP2_15' data-id='PP2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So that you may be holy and gentle, children of God without sin in a twisted and foolish generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world, </span>
<span class='v PP2_16' data-id='PP2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Offering the word of life; so that I may have glory in you in the day of Christ, because my running was not for nothing and my work was not without effect. </span>
<span class='v PP2_17' data-id='PP2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And even if I am offered like a drink offering, giving myself for the cause and work of your faith, I am glad and have joy with you all: </span>
<span class='v PP2_18' data-id='PP2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And in the same way do you be glad and have a part in my joy. </span>
<span class='v PP2_19' data-id='PP2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I am hoping in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be comforted when I have news of you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_20' data-id='PP2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I have no man of like mind who will truly have care for you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_21' data-id='PP2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For they all go after what is theirs, not after the things of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP2_22' data-id='PP2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But his quality is clear to you; how, as a child is to its father, so he was a help to me in the work of the good news. </span>
<span class='v PP2_23' data-id='PP2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Him then I am hoping to send as quickly as possible, when I am able to see how things will go for me: </span>
<span class='v PP2_24' data-id='PP2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But I have faith in the Lord that I myself will come before long. </span>
<span class='v PP2_25' data-id='PP2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But it seemed to me necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, who has taken part with me in the work and in the fight, and your servant, sent by you for help in my need; </span>
<span class='v PP2_26' data-id='PP2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Because his heart was with you all, and he was greatly troubled because you had news that he was ill: </span>
<span class='v PP2_27' data-id='PP2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For in fact he was ill almost to death: but God had mercy on him; and not only on him but on me, so that I might not have grief on grief. </span>
<span class='v PP2_28' data-id='PP2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I have sent him, then, the more gladly, so that when you see him again, you may be happy and I may have the less sorrow. </span>
<span class='v PP2_29' data-id='PP2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So take him to your hearts in the Lord with all joy, and give honour to such as he is: </span>
<span class='v PP2_30' data-id='PP2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, putting his life in danger to make your care for me complete. </span></div></div>
