<span class='v LK3_1' data-id='LK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now in the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being ruler of Judaea, and Herod being king of Galilee, his brother Philip king of the country of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias king of Abilene, </span>
<span class='v LK3_2' data-id='LK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, the word of the Lord came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the waste land. </span>
<span class='v LK3_3' data-id='LK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he came into all the country round about Jordan, preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed. </span>
<span class='v LK3_4' data-id='LK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As it says in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight. </span>
<span class='v LK3_5' data-id='LK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Every valley will be lifted up, and all the mountains and hills made low, and the twisted will be made straight, and the rough ways smooth; </span>
<span class='v LK3_6' data-id='LK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And all flesh will see the salvation of God. </span>
<span class='v LK3_7' data-id='LK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So he said to the people who went out to him for baptism: You offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come? </span>
<span class='v LK3_8' data-id='LK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Make clear by your acts that your hearts have been changed; and do not say to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v LK3_9' data-id='LK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; and every tree which does not have good fruit will be cut down and put into the fire. </span>
<span class='v LK3_10' data-id='LK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the people put questions to him, saying, What have we to do? </span>
<span class='v LK3_11' data-id='LK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he made answer and said to them, He who has two coats, let him give to him who has not even one; and he who has food, let him do the same. </span>
<span class='v LK3_12' data-id='LK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then tax-farmers came to him for baptism and said to him, Master, what have we to do? </span>
<span class='v LK3_13' data-id='LK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Do not make an attempt to get more money than the right amount. </span>
<span class='v LK3_14' data-id='LK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And men of the army put questions to him, saying, And what have we to do? And he said to them, Do no violent acts to any man, and do not take anything without right, and let your payment be enough for you. </span>
<span class='v LK3_15' data-id='LK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And while the people were waiting, and all men were questioning in their hearts about John, if he was the Christ or not, </span>
<span class='v LK3_16' data-id='LK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>John made answer, saying to them all, Truly, I give you baptism with water, but one is coming who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit, and with fire: </span>
<span class='v LK3_17' data-id='LK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned in the fire which will never be put out. </span>
<span class='v LK3_18' data-id='LK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And so comforting them with these and other words, he gave the good news to the people; </span>
<span class='v LK3_19' data-id='LK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Herod the king, because John had made a protest on account of Herodias, his brother's wife, and other evil things which Herod had done, </span>
<span class='v LK3_20' data-id='LK3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Did this most evil thing of all, and had John shut up in prison. </span>
<span class='v LK3_21' data-id='LK3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Now it came about that when all the people had been given baptism, Jesus, having had baptism with them, was in prayer, when, the heaven being open, </span>
<span class='v LK3_22' data-id='LK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Holy Spirit came down in the form of a dove, and a voice came from heaven, saying, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. </span>
<span class='v LK3_23' data-id='LK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus at this time was about thirty years old, being the son (as it seemed) of Joseph, the son of Heli, </span>
