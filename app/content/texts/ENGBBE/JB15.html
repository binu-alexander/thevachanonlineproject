<span class='v JB15_1' data-id='JB15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB15_2' data-id='JB15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Will a wise man make answer with knowledge of no value, or will he give birth to the east wind? </span>
<span class='v JB15_3' data-id='JB15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Will he make arguments with words in which is no profit, and with sayings which have no value? </span>
<span class='v JB15_4' data-id='JB15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Truly, you make the fear of God without effect, so that the time of quiet worship before God is made less by your outcry. </span>
<span class='v JB15_5' data-id='JB15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For your mouth is guided by your sin, and you have taken the tongue of the false for yourself. </span>
<span class='v JB15_6' data-id='JB15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It is by your mouth, even yours, that you are judged to be in the wrong, and not by me; and your lips give witness against you. </span>
<span class='v JB15_7' data-id='JB15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Were you the first man to come into the world? or did you come into being before the hills? </span>
<span class='v JB15_8' data-id='JB15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Were you present at the secret meeting of God? and have you taken all wisdom for yourself? </span>
<span class='v JB15_9' data-id='JB15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What knowledge have you which we have not? is there anything in your mind which is not in ours? </span>
<span class='v JB15_10' data-id='JB15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>With us are men who are grey-haired and full of years, much older than your father. </span>
<span class='v JB15_11' data-id='JB15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Are the comforts of God not enough for you, and the gentle word which was said to you? </span>
<span class='v JB15_12' data-id='JB15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Why is your heart uncontrolled, and why are your eyes lifted up; </span>
<span class='v JB15_13' data-id='JB15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So that you are turning your spirit against God, and letting such words go out of your mouth? </span>
<span class='v JB15_14' data-id='JB15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What is man, that he may be clean? and how may the son of woman be upright? </span>
<span class='v JB15_15' data-id='JB15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Truly, he puts no faith in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his eyes; </span>
<span class='v JB15_16' data-id='JB15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>How much less one who is disgusting and unclean, a man who takes in evil like water! </span>
<span class='v JB15_17' data-id='JB15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Take note and give ear to my words; and I will say what I have seen: </span>
<span class='v JB15_18' data-id='JB15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>(The things which wise men have got from their fathers, and have not kept secret from us; </span>
<span class='v JB15_19' data-id='JB15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For only to them was the land given, and no strange people were among them:) </span>
<span class='v JB15_20' data-id='JB15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The evil man is in pain all his days, and the number of the years stored up for the cruel is small. </span>
<span class='v JB15_21' data-id='JB15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>A sound of fear is in his ears; in time of peace destruction will come on him: </span>
<span class='v JB15_22' data-id='JB15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He has no hope of coming safe out of the dark, and his fate will be the sword; </span>
<span class='v JB15_23' data-id='JB15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He is wandering about in search of bread, saying, Where is it? and he is certain that the day of trouble is ready for him: </span>
<span class='v JB15_24' data-id='JB15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He is greatly in fear of the dark day, trouble and pain overcome him: </span>
<span class='v JB15_25' data-id='JB15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Because his hand is stretched out against God, and his heart is lifted up against the Ruler of all, </span>
<span class='v JB15_26' data-id='JB15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Running against him like a man of war, covered by his thick breastplate; even like a king ready for the fight, </span>
<span class='v JB15_27' data-id='JB15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Because his face is covered with fat, and his body has become thick; </span>
<span class='v JB15_28' data-id='JB15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he has made his resting-place in the towns which have been pulled down, in houses where no man had a right to be, whose fate was to become masses of broken walls. </span>
<span class='v JB15_29' data-id='JB15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He does not get wealth for himself, and is unable to keep what he has got; the heads of his grain are not bent down to the earth. </span>
<span class='v JB15_30' data-id='JB15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He does not come out of the dark; his branches are burned by the flame, and the wind takes away his bud. </span>
<span class='v JB15_31' data-id='JB15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Let him not put his hope in what is false, falling into error: for he will get deceit as his reward. </span>
<span class='v JB15_32' data-id='JB15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>His branch is cut off before its time, and his leaf is no longer green. </span>
<span class='v JB15_33' data-id='JB15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He is like a vine whose grapes do not come to full growth, or an olive-tree dropping its flowers. </span>
<span class='v JB15_34' data-id='JB15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For the band of the evil-doers gives no fruit, and the tents of those who give wrong decisions for reward are burned with fire. </span>
<span class='v JB15_35' data-id='JB15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Evil has made them with child, and they give birth to trouble; and the fruit of their body is shame for themselves. </span></div></div>
