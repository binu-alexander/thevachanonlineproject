<span class='v JB16_1' data-id='JB16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB16_2' data-id='JB16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Such things have frequently come to my ears: you are comforters who only give trouble. </span>
<span class='v JB16_3' data-id='JB16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>May words which are like the wind be stopped? or what is troubling you to make answer to them? </span>
<span class='v JB16_4' data-id='JB16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It would not be hard for me to say such things if your souls were in my soul's place; joining words together against you, and shaking my head at you: </span>
<span class='v JB16_5' data-id='JB16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I might give you strength with my mouth, and not keep back the comfort of my lips. </span>
<span class='v JB16_6' data-id='JB16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If I say what is in my mind, my pain becomes no less: and if I keep quiet, how much of it goes from me? </span>
<span class='v JB16_7' data-id='JB16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But now he has overcome me with weariness and fear, and I am in the grip of all my trouble. </span>
<span class='v JB16_8' data-id='JB16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>It has come up as a witness against me, and the wasting of my flesh makes answer to my face. </span>
<span class='v JB16_9' data-id='JB16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I am broken by his wrath, and his hate has gone after me; he has made his teeth sharp against me: my haters are looking on me with cruel eyes; </span>
<span class='v JB16_10' data-id='JB16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Their mouths are open wide against me; the blows of his bitter words are falling on my face; all of them come together in a mass against me. </span>
<span class='v JB16_11' data-id='JB16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>God gives me over to the power of sinners, sending me violently into the hands of evil-doers. </span>
<span class='v JB16_12' data-id='JB16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I was in comfort, but I have been broken up by his hands; he has taken me by the neck, shaking me to bits; he has put me up as a mark for his arrows. </span>
<span class='v JB16_13' data-id='JB16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>His bowmen come round about me; their arrows go through my body without mercy; my life is drained out on the earth. </span>
<span class='v JB16_14' data-id='JB16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am broken with wound after wound; he comes rushing on me like a man of war. </span>
<span class='v JB16_15' data-id='JB16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I have made haircloth the clothing of my skin, and my horn is rolled in the dust. </span>
<span class='v JB16_16' data-id='JB16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>My face is red with weeping, and my eyes are becoming dark; </span>
<span class='v JB16_17' data-id='JB16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Though my hands have done no violent acts, and my prayer is clean. </span>
<span class='v JB16_18' data-id='JB16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>O earth, let not my blood be covered, and let my cry have no resting-place! </span>
<span class='v JB16_19' data-id='JB16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Even now my witness is in heaven, and the supporter of my cause is on high. </span>
<span class='v JB16_20' data-id='JB16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>My friends make sport of me; to God my eyes are weeping, </span>
<span class='v JB16_21' data-id='JB16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So that he may give decision for a man in his cause with God, and between a son of man and his neighbour. </span>
<span class='v JB16_22' data-id='JB16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For in a short time I will take the journey from which I will not come back. </span></div></div>
