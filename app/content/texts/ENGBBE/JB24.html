<span class='v JB24_1' data-id='JB24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Why are times not stored up by the Ruler of all, and why do those who have knowledge of him not see his days? </span>
<span class='v JB24_2' data-id='JB24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The landmarks are changed by evil men, they violently take away flocks, together with their keepers. </span>
<span class='v JB24_3' data-id='JB24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They send away the ass of him who has no father, they take the widow's ox for debt. </span>
<span class='v JB24_4' data-id='JB24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The crushed are turned out of the way; all the poor of the earth go into a secret place together. </span>
<span class='v JB24_5' data-id='JB24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Like asses in the waste land they go out to their work, looking for food with care; from the waste land they get bread for their children. </span>
<span class='v JB24_6' data-id='JB24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They get mixed grain from the field, and they take away the late fruit from the vines of those who have wealth. </span>
<span class='v JB24_7' data-id='JB24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They take their rest at night without clothing, and have no cover in the cold. </span>
<span class='v JB24_8' data-id='JB24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They are wet with the rain of the mountains, and get into the cracks of the rock for cover. </span>
<span class='v JB24_9' data-id='JB24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The child without a father is forced from its mother's breast, and they take the young children of the poor for debt. </span>
<span class='v JB24_10' data-id='JB24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Others go about without clothing, and though they have no food, they get in the grain from the fields. </span>
<span class='v JB24_11' data-id='JB24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Between the lines of olive-trees they make oil; though they have no drink, they are crushing out the grapes. </span>
<span class='v JB24_12' data-id='JB24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>From the town come sounds of pain from those who are near death, and the soul of the wounded is crying out for help; but God does not take note of their prayer. </span>
<span class='v JB24_13' data-id='JB24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then there are those who are haters of the light, who have no knowledge of its ways, and do not go in them. </span>
<span class='v JB24_14' data-id='JB24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He who is purposing death gets up before day, so that he may put to death the poor and those in need. </span>
<span class='v JB24_15' data-id='JB24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the man whose desire is for the wife of another is waiting for the evening, saying, No eye will see me; and he puts a cover on his face. And in the night the thief goes about; </span>
<span class='v JB24_16' data-id='JB24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the dark he makes holes in the walls of houses: in the daytime they are shutting themselves up, they have no knowledge of the light. </span>
<span class='v JB24_17' data-id='JB24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the middle of the night is as morning to them, they are not troubled by the fear of the dark. </span>
<span class='v JB24_18' data-id='JB24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They go quickly on the face of the waters; their heritage is cursed in the earth; the steps of the crusher of grapes are not turned to their vine-garden. </span>
<span class='v JB24_19' data-id='JB24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Snow waters become dry with the heat: so do sinners go down into the underworld. </span>
<span class='v JB24_20' data-id='JB24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The public place of his town has no more knowledge of him, and his name has gone from the memory of men: he is rooted up like a dead tree. </span>
<span class='v JB24_21' data-id='JB24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He is not kind to the widow, and he has no pity for her child. </span>
<span class='v JB24_22' data-id='JB24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But God by his power gives long life to the strong; he gets up again, though he has no hope of life. </span>
<span class='v JB24_23' data-id='JB24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He takes away his fear of danger and gives him support; and his eyes are on his ways. </span>
<span class='v JB24_24' data-id='JB24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For a short time they are lifted up; then they are gone; they are made low, they are pulled off like fruit, and like the heads of grain they are cut off. </span>
<span class='v JB24_25' data-id='JB24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And if it is not so, now, who will make it clear that my words are false, and that what I say is of no value? </span></div></div>
