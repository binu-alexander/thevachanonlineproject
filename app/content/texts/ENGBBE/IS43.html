<span class='v IS43_1' data-id='IS43_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But now, says the Lord your Maker, O Jacob, and your life-giver, O Israel: have no fear, for I have taken up your cause; naming you by your name, I have made you mine. </span>
<span class='v IS43_2' data-id='IS43_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When you go through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not go over you: when you go through the fire, you will not be burned; and the flame will have no power over you. </span>
<span class='v IS43_3' data-id='IS43_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your saviour; I have given Egypt as a price for you, Ethiopia and Seba for you. </span>
<span class='v IS43_4' data-id='IS43_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because of your value in my eyes, you have been honoured, and loved by me; so I will give men for you, and peoples for your life. </span>
<span class='v IS43_5' data-id='IS43_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Have no fear, for I am with you: I will take your seed from the east, and get you together from the west; </span>
<span class='v IS43_6' data-id='IS43_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will say to the north, Give them up; and to the south, Do not keep them back; send back my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth; </span>
<span class='v IS43_7' data-id='IS43_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Every one who is named by my name, and whom I have made for my glory, who has been formed and designed by me. </span>
<span class='v IS43_8' data-id='IS43_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Send out the blind people who have eyes, and those who have ears, but they are shut. </span>
<span class='v IS43_9' data-id='IS43_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let all the nations come together, and let the peoples be present: who among them is able to make this clear, and give us word of earlier things? let their witnesses come forward, so that they may be seen to be true, and that they may give ear, and say, It is true. </span>
<span class='v IS43_10' data-id='IS43_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and my servant whom I have taken for myself: so that you may see and have faith in me, and that it may be clear to you that I am he; before me there was no God formed, and there will not be after me. </span>
<span class='v IS43_11' data-id='IS43_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I, even I, am the Lord; and there is no saviour but me. </span>
<span class='v IS43_12' data-id='IS43_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I gave the word, and made it clear, and there was no strange god among you: for this reason you are my witnesses, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS43_13' data-id='IS43_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>From time long past I am God, and from this day I am he: there is no one who is able to take you out of my hand: when I undertake a thing, by whom will my purpose be changed? </span>
<span class='v IS43_14' data-id='IS43_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Lord, who has taken up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, Because of you I have sent to Babylon, and made all their seers come south, and the Chaldaeans whose cry is in the ships. </span>
<span class='v IS43_15' data-id='IS43_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Maker of Israel, your King. </span>
<span class='v IS43_16' data-id='IS43_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This is the word of the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a road through the deep waters; </span>
<span class='v IS43_17' data-id='IS43_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Who sends out the war-carriages and the horses, the army with all its force; they have come down, they will not get up again; like a feebly burning light they are put out. </span>
<span class='v IS43_18' data-id='IS43_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Give no thought to the things which are past; let the early times go out of your minds. </span>
<span class='v IS43_19' data-id='IS43_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>See, I am doing a new thing; now it is starting; will you not take note of it? I will even make a way in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country. </span>
<span class='v IS43_20' data-id='IS43_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The beasts of the field will give me honour, the jackals and the ostriches: because I send out waters in the waste land, and rivers in the dry country, to give drink to the people whom I have taken for myself: </span>
<span class='v IS43_21' data-id='IS43_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Even the people whom I made to be the witnesses of my praise. </span>
<span class='v IS43_22' data-id='IS43_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But you have made no prayer to me, O Jacob: and you have given no thought to me, O Israel. </span>
<span class='v IS43_23' data-id='IS43_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You have not made me burned offerings of sheep, or given me honour with your offerings of beasts; I did not make you servants to give me an offering, and I did not make you tired with requests for perfumes. </span>
<span class='v IS43_24' data-id='IS43_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You have not got me sweet-smelling plants with your money, or given me pleasure with the fat of your offerings: but you have made me a servant to your sins, and you have made me tired with your evil doings. </span>
<span class='v IS43_25' data-id='IS43_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I, even I, am he who takes away your sins; and I will no longer keep your evil doings in mind. </span>
<span class='v IS43_26' data-id='IS43_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Put me in mind of this; let us take up the cause between us: put forward your cause, so that you may be seen to be in the right. </span>
<span class='v IS43_27' data-id='IS43_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Your first father was a sinner, and your guides have gone against my word. </span>
<span class='v IS43_28' data-id='IS43_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Your chiefs have made my holy place unclean, so I have made Jacob a curse, and Israel a thing of shame. </span></div></div>
