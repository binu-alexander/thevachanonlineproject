<span class='v JH2_1' data-id='JH2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah made prayer to the Lord his God from the inside of the fish, and said, </span>
<span class='v JH2_2' data-id='JH2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In my trouble I was crying to the Lord, and he gave me an answer; out of the deepest underworld I sent up a cry, and you gave ear to my voice. </span>
<span class='v JH2_3' data-id='JH2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For you have put me down into the deep, into the heart of the sea; and the river was round about me; all your waves and your rolling waters went over me. </span>
<span class='v JH2_4' data-id='JH2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I said, I have been sent away from before your eyes; how may I ever again see your holy Temple? </span>
<span class='v JH2_5' data-id='JH2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The waters were circling round me, even to the neck; the deep was about me; the sea-grass was twisted round my head. </span>
<span class='v JH2_6' data-id='JH2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I went down to the bases of the mountains; as for the earth, her walls were about me for ever: but you have taken up my life from the underworld, O Lord my God. </span>
<span class='v JH2_7' data-id='JH2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When my soul in me was overcome, I kept the memory of the Lord: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy Temple. </span>
<span class='v JH2_8' data-id='JH2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The worshippers of false gods have given up their only hope. </span>
<span class='v JH2_9' data-id='JH2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But I will make an offering to you with the voice of praise; I will give effect to my oaths. Salvation is the Lord's. </span>
<span class='v JH2_10' data-id='JH2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And at the Lord's order, the fish sent Jonah out of its mouth on to the dry land. </span></div></div>
