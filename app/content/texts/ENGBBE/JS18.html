<span class='v JS18_1' data-id='JS18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And all the meeting of the children of Israel came together at Shiloh and put up the Tent of meeting there: and the land was crushed before them. </span>
<span class='v JS18_2' data-id='JS18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But there were still seven tribes among the children of Israel who had not taken up their heritage. </span>
<span class='v JS18_3' data-id='JS18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said to the children of Israel, Why are you so slow to go in and take up your heritage in the land which the Lord, the God of your fathers, has given you? </span>
<span class='v JS18_4' data-id='JS18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Take from among you three men from every tribe; and I will send them to go through the land and make a record of it for distribution as their heritage; then let them come back to me. </span>
<span class='v JS18_5' data-id='JS18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And let them make division of it into seven parts: let Judah keep inside his limit on the south, and let the children of Joseph keep inside their limit on the north. </span>
<span class='v JS18_6' data-id='JS18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you are to have the land marked out in seven parts, and come back to me with the record; and I will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the Lord our God. </span>
<span class='v JS18_7' data-id='JS18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the Levites have no part among you; to be the Lord's priests is their heritage; and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have had their heritage on the east side of Jordan, given to them by Moses, the servant of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JS18_8' data-id='JS18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So the men got up and went; and Joshua gave orders to those who went, to make a record of the land, saying, Go up and down through the land, and make a record of it and come back here to me, and I will make the distribution for you here by the decision of the Lord in Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v JS18_9' data-id='JS18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So the men went, travelling through the land, and made a record of it by towns in seven parts in a book, and came back to Joshua to the tent-circle at Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v JS18_10' data-id='JS18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Joshua made the distribution for them in Shiloh by the decision of the Lord, marking out the land for the children of Israel by their divisions. </span>
<span class='v JS18_11' data-id='JS18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the first heritage came out for the tribe of Benjamin by their families: and the limit of their heritage went between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. </span>
<span class='v JS18_12' data-id='JS18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And their limit on the north was from the Jordan, and the line goes up to the side of Jericho on the north and through the hill-country to the west, ending at the waste land of Beth-aven. </span>
<span class='v JS18_13' data-id='JS18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And from there the line goes south to Luz, to the side of Luz (which is Beth-el), then down to Ataroth-addar, by the mountain to the south of Beth-horon the lower. </span>
<span class='v JS18_14' data-id='JS18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the limit is marked as coming round to the south on the west side from the mountain which is south of Beth-horon, and ending at Kiriath-baal (which is Kiriath-jearim), a town of the children of Judah: this is the west part. </span>

<span class='v JS18_16' data-id='JS18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the line goes down to the farthest part of the mountain facing the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is on the north of the valley of Rephaim: from there it goes down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite on the south as far as En-rogel; </span>
<span class='v JS18_17' data-id='JS18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And it goes to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, opposite the way up to Adummim, and it goes down to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben; </span>
<span class='v JS18_18' data-id='JS18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And it goes on to the side facing the Arabah to the north, and down to the Arabah; </span>
<span class='v JS18_19' data-id='JS18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And on to the north side of Beth-hoglah, ending at the north inlet of the Salt Sea at the south end of Jordan; this is their limit on the south. </span>
<span class='v JS18_20' data-id='JS18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the limit of the east part is the Jordan. This is the heritage of the children of Benjamin, marked out for their families by these limits on all sides. </span>
