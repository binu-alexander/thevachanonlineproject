<span class='v H11_1' data-id='H11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace. </span>
<span class='v H11_2' data-id='H11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We give praise to God at all times for you, keeping you in memory in our prayers; </span>
<span class='v H11_3' data-id='H11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Having ever in mind your work of faith and acts of love and the strength of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father; </span>
<span class='v H11_4' data-id='H11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Being conscious, my brothers, dear to God, that you have been marked out by God's purpose; </span>
<span class='v H11_5' data-id='H11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Because our good news came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Spirit, so that you were completely certain of it; even as you saw what our behaviour to you was like from our love to you. </span>
<span class='v H11_6' data-id='H11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you took us and the Lord as your example, after the word had come to you in much trouble, with joy in the Holy Spirit; </span>
<span class='v H11_7' data-id='H11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So that you became an example to all those who have faith in Christ in Macedonia and Achaia. </span>
<span class='v H11_8' data-id='H11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For not only was the word of the Lord sounding out from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God is made clear; so that we have no need to say anything. </span>
<span class='v H11_9' data-id='H11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For they themselves give the news of how we came among you; and how you were turned from images to God, to the worship of a true and living God, </span>
<span class='v H11_10' data-id='H11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Waiting for his Son from heaven, who came back from the dead, even Jesus, our Saviour from the wrath to come. </span></div></div>
