<span class='v IS3_1' data-id='IS3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For the Lord, the Lord of armies, is about to take away from Jerusalem and from Judah all their support; their store of bread and of water; </span>
<span class='v IS3_2' data-id='IS3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The strong man and the man of war; the judge and the prophet; the man who has knowledge of secret arts, and the man who is wise because of his years; </span>
<span class='v IS3_3' data-id='IS3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The captain of fifty, and the man of high position, and the wise guide, and the wonder-worker, and he who makes use of secret powers. </span>
<span class='v IS3_4' data-id='IS3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will make children their chiefs, and foolish ones will have rule over them. </span>
<span class='v IS3_5' data-id='IS3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the people will be crushed, every one by his neighbour; the young will be full of pride against the old, and those of low position will be lifted up against the noble. </span>
<span class='v IS3_6' data-id='IS3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When one man puts his hand on another in his father's house, and says, You have clothing, be our ruler and be responsible for us in our sad condition: </span>
<span class='v IS3_7' data-id='IS3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he will say with an oath, I will not be a helper, for in my house there is no bread or clothing: I will not let you make me a ruler of the people. </span>
<span class='v IS3_8' data-id='IS3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For Jerusalem has become feeble, and destruction has come on Judah, because their words and their acts are against the Lord, moving the eyes of his glory to wrath. </span>
<span class='v IS3_9' data-id='IS3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Their respect for a man's position is a witness against them; and their sin is open to the view of all; like that of Sodom, it is not covered. A curse on their soul! for the measure of their sin is full. </span>
<span class='v IS3_10' data-id='IS3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Happy is the upright man! for he will have joy of the fruit of his ways. </span>
<span class='v IS3_11' data-id='IS3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Unhappy is the sinner! for the reward of his evil doings will come on him. </span>
<span class='v IS3_12' data-id='IS3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for my people, their ruler is acting like a child, and those who have authority over them are women. O my people, your guides are the cause of your wandering, turning your footsteps out of the right way. </span>
<span class='v IS3_13' data-id='IS3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The Lord is ready to take up his cause against his people, and is about to come forward as their judge. </span>
<span class='v IS3_14' data-id='IS3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Lord comes to be the judge of their responsible men and of their rulers: it is you who have made waste the vine-garden, and in your houses is the property of the poor which you have taken by force. </span>
<span class='v IS3_15' data-id='IS3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>By what right are you crushing my people, and putting a bitter yoke on the necks of the poor? This is the word of the Lord, the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v IS3_16' data-id='IS3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Again, the Lord has said, Because the daughters of Zion are full of pride, and go with outstretched necks and wandering eyes, with their foot-chains sounding when they go: </span>
<span class='v IS3_17' data-id='IS3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The Lord will send disease on the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will let their secret parts be seen. </span>
<span class='v IS3_18' data-id='IS3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In that day the Lord will take away the glory of their foot-rings, and their sun-jewels, and their moon-ornaments, </span>
<span class='v IS3_19' data-id='IS3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The ear-rings, and the chains, and the delicate clothing, </span>
<span class='v IS3_20' data-id='IS3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The head-bands, and the arm-chains, and the worked bands, and the perfume-boxes, and the jewels with secret powers, </span>
<span class='v IS3_21' data-id='IS3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The rings, and the nose-jewels, </span>
<span class='v IS3_22' data-id='IS3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The feast-day dresses, and the robes, and the wide skirts, and the handbags, </span>
<span class='v IS3_23' data-id='IS3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The looking-glasses, and the fair linen, and the high head-dresses, and the veils. </span>
<span class='v IS3_24' data-id='IS3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And in the place of sweet spices will be an evil smell, and for a fair band a thick cord; for a well-dressed head there will be the cutting-off of the hair, and for a beautiful robe there will be the clothing of sorrow; the mark of the prisoner in place of the ornaments of the free. </span>
<span class='v IS3_25' data-id='IS3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Your men will be put to the sword, and your men of war will come to destruction in the fight. </span>
<span class='v IS3_26' data-id='IS3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And in the public places of her towns will be sorrow and weeping; and she will be seated on the earth, waste and uncovered. </span></div></div>
