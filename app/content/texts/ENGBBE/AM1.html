<span class='v AM1_2' data-id='AM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said, The Lord will give a lion's cry from Zion, his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the fields of the keepers of sheep will become dry, and the top of Carmel will be wasted away. </span>
<span class='v AM1_3' data-id='AM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they have been crushing Gilead with iron grain-crushing instruments. </span>
<span class='v AM1_4' data-id='AM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, burning up the great houses of Ben-hadad. </span>
<span class='v AM1_5' data-id='AM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I will have the locks of the door of Damascus broken, and him who is seated in power cut off from the valley of Aven, and him in whose hand is the rod from the house of Eden; and the people of Aram will go away as prisoners into Kir, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AM1_6' data-id='AM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Gaza, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they took all the people away prisoners, to give them up to Edom. </span>
<span class='v AM1_7' data-id='AM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, burning up its great houses: </span>
<span class='v AM1_8' data-id='AM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Him who is seated in power I will have cut off from Ashdod, and him in whose hand is the rod from Ashkelon; and my hand will be turned against Ekron, and the rest of the Philistines will come to destruction, says the Lord God. </span>
<span class='v AM1_9' data-id='AM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>These are the words of the Lord: For three crimes of Tyre, and for four, I will not let its fate be changed; because they gave up all the people prisoners to Edom, without giving a thought to the brothers' agreement between them. </span>
<span class='v AM1_10' data-id='AM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, burning up its great houses. </span>

<span class='v AM1_14' data-id='AM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I will make a fire in the wall of Rabbah, burning up its great houses, with loud cries in the days of war, with a storm in the day of the great wind: </span>
