<span class='v LM3_2' data-id='LM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By him I have been made to go in the dark where there is no light. </span>
<span class='v LM3_3' data-id='LM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day. </span>
<span class='v LM3_4' data-id='LM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken. </span>
<span class='v LM3_5' data-id='LM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow. </span>
<span class='v LM3_6' data-id='LM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead. </span>
<span class='v LM3_7' data-id='LM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain. </span>
<span class='v LM3_8' data-id='LM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out. </span>
<span class='v LM3_9' data-id='LM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted. </span>
<span class='v LM3_10' data-id='LM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places. </span>
<span class='v LM3_11' data-id='LM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste. </span>
<span class='v LM3_12' data-id='LM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows. </span>
<span class='v LM3_13' data-id='LM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body. </span>
<span class='v LM3_14' data-id='LM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day. </span>
<span class='v LM3_15' data-id='LM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure. </span>

<span class='v LM3_22' data-id='LM3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>It is through the Lord's love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit. </span>

<span class='v LM3_26' data-id='LM3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LM3_27' data-id='LM3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young. </span>
<span class='v LM3_28' data-id='LM3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him. </span>
<span class='v LM3_29' data-id='LM3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope. </span>
<span class='v LM3_30' data-id='LM3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame. </span>
<span class='v LM3_31' data-id='LM3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For the Lord does not give a man up for ever. </span>
<span class='v LM3_32' data-id='LM3_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love. </span>
<span class='v LM3_33' data-id='LM3_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men. </span>
<span class='v LM3_34' data-id='LM3_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>In a man's crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, </span>
<span class='v LM3_35' data-id='LM3_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High. </span>
<span class='v LM3_36' data-id='LM3_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure. </span>
<span class='v LM3_37' data-id='LM3_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord? </span>
<span class='v LM3_38' data-id='LM3_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High? </span>
<span class='v LM3_39' data-id='LM3_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin? </span>
<span class='v LM3_40' data-id='LM3_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord; </span>
<span class='v LM3_41' data-id='LM3_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens. </span>

<span class='v LM3_49' data-id='LM3_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>My eyes are streaming without stopping, they have no rest, </span>
<span class='v LM3_50' data-id='LM3_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Till the Lord's eye is turned on me, till he sees my trouble from heaven. </span>
<span class='v LM3_51' data-id='LM3_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town. </span>
<span class='v LM3_52' data-id='LM3_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird; </span>
<span class='v LM3_53' data-id='LM3_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones. </span>
<span class='v LM3_54' data-id='LM3_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off. </span>
<span class='v LM3_55' data-id='LM3_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison. </span>
<span class='v LM3_56' data-id='LM3_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>My voice came to you; let not your ear be shut to my breathing, to my cry. </span>
<span class='v LM3_57' data-id='LM3_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you: you said, Have no fear. </span>

<span class='v LM3_60' data-id='LM3_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me, and all their designs against me. </span>
