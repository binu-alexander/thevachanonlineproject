<span class='v ZC9_1' data-id='ZC9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A word of the Lord: The Lord has come to the land of Hadrach, and Damascus is his resting-place: for the towns of Aram are the Lord's, </span>
<span class='v ZC9_2' data-id='ZC9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As well as Hamath, which is by its limit, and Tyre and Zidon, because they are very wise. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_3' data-id='ZC9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Tyre made for herself a strong place, and got together silver like dust and the best gold like the earth of the streets. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_4' data-id='ZC9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>See, the Lord will take away her heritage, overturning her power in the sea; and she will be burned up with fire. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_5' data-id='ZC9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Ashkelon will see it with fear, and Gaza, bent with pain; and Ekron, for her hope will be shamed: and the king will be cut off from Gaza, and Ashkelon will be unpeopled. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_6' data-id='ZC9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And a mixed people will be living in Ashdod, and I will have the pride of the Philistines cut off. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_7' data-id='ZC9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I will take away his blood from his mouth, and his disgusting things from between his teeth; and some of his people will be kept for our God: and he will be as a family in Judah, and Ekron as one living in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_8' data-id='ZC9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I will put my forces in position round my house, so that there may be no coming and going: and no cruel master will again go through them: for now I have seen his trouble. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_9' data-id='ZC9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be full of joy, O daughter of Zion; give a glad cry, O daughter of Jerusalem: see, your king comes to you: he is upright and has overcome; gentle and seated on an ass, on a young ass. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_10' data-id='ZC9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he will have the war-carriage cut off from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war will be cut off: and he will say words of peace to the nations: and his rule will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_11' data-id='ZC9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And as for you, because of the blood of your agreement, I have sent out your prisoners from the deep hole in which there is no water. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_12' data-id='ZC9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they will come back to you, O daughter of Zion, as prisoners of hope: today I say to you that I will give you back twice as much; </span>
<span class='v ZC9_13' data-id='ZC9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For I have made Judah a bow bent for my use, I have made Ephraim the arrows of the bow; I will make your sons, O Zion, take up arms against your sons, O Greece, and will make you like the sword of a man of war. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_14' data-id='ZC9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will be seen over them, and his arrow will go out like the thunder-flame: and the Lord God, sounding the war-horn, will go in the storm-winds of the South. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_15' data-id='ZC9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Lord of armies will be a cover for them; and they will overcome, crushing under foot the armed men; they will take their blood for drink like wine: they will be full like the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_16' data-id='ZC9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the Lord their God will be their saviour in that day, giving them food like the flock of his people: for they will be like the jewels of a crown shining over his land. </span>
<span class='v ZC9_17' data-id='ZC9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For how good it is and how beautiful! grain will make the young men strong and new wine the virgins. </span></div></div>
