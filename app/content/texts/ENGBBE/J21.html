<span class='v J21_1' data-id='J21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I, a ruler in the church, send word to the noble sister who is of God's selection, and to her children, for whom I have true love; and not only I, but all who have knowledge of what is true; </span>
<span class='v J21_2' data-id='J21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Because of this true knowledge which is in us, and will be with us for ever: </span>
<span class='v J21_3' data-id='J21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>May grace, mercy, and peace be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in all true love. </span>
<span class='v J21_4' data-id='J21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It gave me great joy to see some of your children walking in the true way, even as we were ordered to do by the Father. </span>
<span class='v J21_5' data-id='J21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And now, my sister, I make a request to you, not sending you a new law, but the law which we had from the first, that we have love for one another. </span>
<span class='v J21_6' data-id='J21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And love is the keeping of his laws. This is the law which was given to you from the first, so that you might keep it. </span>
<span class='v J21_7' data-id='J21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Because a number of false teachers have gone out into the world, who do not give witness that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. Such a one is a false teacher and Antichrist. </span>
<span class='v J21_8' data-id='J21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Keep watch over yourselves, so that you do not make our work of no effect, but may get your full reward. </span>
<span class='v J21_9' data-id='J21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Anyone who goes on and does not keep to the teaching of Christ, has not God: he who keeps to the teaching has the Father and the Son. </span>
<span class='v J21_10' data-id='J21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If anyone comes to you not having this teaching, do not take him into your house or give him words of love: </span>
<span class='v J21_11' data-id='J21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he who gives him words of love has a part in his evil works. </span>
<span class='v J21_12' data-id='J21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Having much to say to you, it is not my purpose to put it all down with paper and ink: but I am hoping to come to you, and to have talk with you face to face, so that your joy may be full. </span>
<span class='v J21_13' data-id='J21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The children of your noble sister, who is of God's selection, send you their love. </span></div></div>
