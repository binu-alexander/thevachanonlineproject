<div class='s'>The Two Witnesses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_1' data-id='RV11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. </span>
<span class='v RV11_2' data-id='RV11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months. </span>
<span class='v RV11_3' data-id='RV11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I will appoint my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” </span>
<span class='v RV11_4' data-id='RV11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They are “the two olive trees” and the two lampstands, and “they stand before the Lord of the earth.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3292'><a href='#note-3292' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v RV11_5' data-id='RV11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies. This is how anyone who wants to harm them must die. </span>
<span class='v RV11_6' data-id='RV11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They have power to shut up the heavens so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying; and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_7' data-id='RV11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now when they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the Abyss will attack them, and overpower and kill them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_8' data-id='RV11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Their bodies will lie in the public square of the great city—which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt—where also their Lord was crucified. </span>
<span class='v RV11_9' data-id='RV11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For three and a half days some from every people, tribe, language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial. </span>
<span class='v RV11_10' data-id='RV11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_11' data-id='RV11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But after the three and a half days the breath<span class='note' id='footnote-3293'><a href='#note-3293' class='key'>†</a></span> of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and terror struck those who saw them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_12' data-id='RV11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here.” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, while their enemies looked on. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_13' data-id='RV11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>At that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_14' data-id='RV11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The second woe has passed; the third woe is coming soon. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Seventh Trumpet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_15' data-id='RV11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: </span></div>

<span class='v RV11_15' data-id='RV11_15'>“The kingdom of the world has become </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_15' data-id='RV11_15'>the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, </span></div>

<span class='v RV11_15' data-id='RV11_15'>and he will reign for ever and ever.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV11_16' data-id='RV11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, </span>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>because you have taken your great power </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>and have begun to reign. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The nations were angry, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and your wrath has come. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>The time has come for judging the dead, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and for rewarding your servants the prophets </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and your people who revere your name, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>both great and small— </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and for destroying those who destroy the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_19' data-id='RV11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake and a severe hailstorm. </span></div></div>
