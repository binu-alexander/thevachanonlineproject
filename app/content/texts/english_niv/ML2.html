<div class='s'>Additional Warning to the Priests </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_1' data-id='ML2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“And now, you priests, this warning is for you. </span>
<span class='v ML2_2' data-id='ML2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If you do not listen, and if you do not resolve to honor my name,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, “I will send a curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Yes, I have already cursed them, because you have not resolved to honor me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_3' data-id='ML2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Because of you I will rebuke your descendants<span class='note' id='footnote-2431'><a href='#note-2431' class='key'>*</a></span>; I will smear on your faces the dung from your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it. </span>
<span class='v ML2_4' data-id='ML2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And you will know that I have sent you this warning so that my covenant with Levi may continue,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v ML2_5' data-id='ML2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“My covenant was with him, a covenant of life and peace, and I gave them to him; this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name. </span>
<span class='v ML2_6' data-id='ML2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>True instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from sin. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_7' data-id='ML2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth. </span>
<span class='v ML2_8' data-id='ML2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v ML2_9' data-id='ML2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“So I have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Breaking Covenant Through Divorce </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_10' data-id='ML2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do we not all have one Father<span class='note' id='footnote-2432'><a href='#note-2432' class='key'>†</a></span>? Did not one God create us? Why do we profane the covenant of our ancestors by being unfaithful to one another? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_11' data-id='ML2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Judah has been unfaithful. A detestable thing has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> loves by marrying women who worship a foreign god. </span>
<span class='v ML2_12' data-id='ML2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for the man who does this, whoever he may be, may the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> remove him from the tents of Jacob<span class='note' id='footnote-2433'><a href='#note-2433' class='key'>‡</a></span>—even though he brings an offering to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_13' data-id='ML2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Another thing you do: You flood the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s altar with tears. You weep and wail because he no longer looks with favor on your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands. </span>
<span class='v ML2_14' data-id='ML2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You ask, “Why?” It is because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is the witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_15' data-id='ML2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring.<span class='note' id='footnote-2434'><a href='#note-2434' class='key'>§</a></span> So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_16' data-id='ML2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“The man who hates and divorces his wife,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, “does violence to the one he should protect,”<span class='note' id='footnote-2435'><a href='#note-2435' class='key'>*</a></span> says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_16' data-id='ML2_16'>So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful. </span></div>

<span class='v ML2_17' data-id='ML2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You have wearied the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with your words. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_17' data-id='ML2_17'>“How have we wearied him?” you ask. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML2_17' data-id='ML2_17'>By saying, “All who do evil are good in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he is pleased with them” or “Where is the God of justice?” </span></div></div>
