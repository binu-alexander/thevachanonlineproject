<span class='v JG3_1' data-id='JG3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>These are the nations the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> left to test all those Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan </span>
<span class='v JG3_2' data-id='JG3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>(he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the Israelites who had not had previous battle experience): </span>
<span class='v JG3_3' data-id='JG3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath. </span>
<span class='v JG3_4' data-id='JG3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They were left to test the Israelites to see whether they would obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s commands, which he had given their ancestors through Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_5' data-id='JG3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. </span>
<span class='v JG3_6' data-id='JG3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Othniel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_7' data-id='JG3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; they forgot the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs. </span>
<span class='v JG3_8' data-id='JG3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> burned against Israel so that he sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim,<span class='note' id='footnote-605'><a href='#note-605' class='key'>*</a></span> to whom the Israelites were subject for eight years. </span>
<span class='v JG3_9' data-id='JG3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But when they cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, he raised up for them a deliverer, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, who saved them. </span>
<span class='v JG3_10' data-id='JG3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came on him, so that he became Israel’s judge<span class='note' id='footnote-606'><a href='#note-606' class='key'>†</a></span> and went to war. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram into the hands of Othniel, who overpowered him. </span>
<span class='v JG3_11' data-id='JG3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So the land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Ehud </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_12' data-id='JG3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and because they did this evil the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave Eglon king of Moab power over Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG3_13' data-id='JG3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Getting the Ammonites and Amalekites to join him, Eglon came and attacked Israel, and they took possession of the City of Palms.<span class='note' id='footnote-607'><a href='#note-607' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v JG3_14' data-id='JG3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Israelites were subject to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_15' data-id='JG3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Again the Israelites cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he gave them a deliverer—Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon king of Moab. </span>
<span class='v JG3_16' data-id='JG3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now Ehud had made a double-edged sword about a cubit<span class='note' id='footnote-608'><a href='#note-608' class='key'>§</a></span> long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing. </span>
<span class='v JG3_17' data-id='JG3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab, who was a very fat man. </span>
<span class='v JG3_18' data-id='JG3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>After Ehud had presented the tribute, he sent on their way those who had carried it. </span>
<span class='v JG3_19' data-id='JG3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But on reaching the stone images near Gilgal he himself went back to Eglon and said, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_19' data-id='JG3_19'>The king said to his attendants, “Leave us!” And they all left. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_20' data-id='JG3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his palace<span class='note' id='footnote-609'><a href='#note-609' class='key'>*</a></span> and said, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his seat, </span>
<span class='v JG3_21' data-id='JG3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king’s belly. </span>
<span class='v JG3_22' data-id='JG3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged. Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it. </span>
<span class='v JG3_23' data-id='JG3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Ehud went out to the porch<span class='note' id='footnote-610'><a href='#note-610' class='key'>†</a></span>; he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_24' data-id='JG3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After he had gone, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.” </span>
<span class='v JG3_25' data-id='JG3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors of the room, they took a key and unlocked them. There they saw their lord fallen to the floor, dead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_26' data-id='JG3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>While they waited, Ehud got away. He passed by the stone images and escaped to Seirah. </span>
<span class='v JG3_27' data-id='JG3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When he arrived there, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_28' data-id='JG3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Follow me,” he ordered, “for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given Moab, your enemy, into your hands.” So they followed him down and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that led to Moab; they allowed no one to cross over. </span>
<span class='v JG3_29' data-id='JG3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all vigorous and strong; not one escaped. </span>
<span class='v JG3_30' data-id='JG3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>That day Moab was made subject to Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Shamgar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG3_31' data-id='JG3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>After Ehud came Shamgar son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel. </span></div></div>
