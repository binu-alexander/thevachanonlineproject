<div class='s'>Jesus Talks With a Samaritan Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_1' data-id='JN4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John— </span>
<span class='v JN4_2' data-id='JN4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN4_3' data-id='JN4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So he left Judea and went back once more to Galilee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_4' data-id='JN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now he had to go through Samaria. </span>
<span class='v JN4_5' data-id='JN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground Jacob had given to his son Joseph. </span>
<span class='v JN4_6' data-id='JN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_7' data-id='JN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Will you give me a drink?”</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_8' data-id='JN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_9' data-id='JN4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.<span class='note' id='footnote-2722'><a href='#note-2722' class='key'>*</a></span>) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_10' data-id='JN4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered her, <span class='wj'>“If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_11' data-id='JN4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” the woman said, “you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water? </span>
<span class='v JN4_12' data-id='JN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did also his sons and his livestock?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_13' data-id='JN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, </span></span>
<span class='v JN4_14' data-id='JN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_15' data-id='JN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_16' data-id='JN4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He told her, <span class='wj'>“Go, call your husband and come back.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_17' data-id='JN4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“I have no husband,” she replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_17' data-id='JN4_17'>Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“You are right when you say you have no husband.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_18' data-id='JN4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_19' data-id='JN4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” the woman said, “I can see that you are a prophet. </span>
<span class='v JN4_20' data-id='JN4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews claim that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_21' data-id='JN4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Woman,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“believe me, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_22' data-id='JN4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You Samaritans worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_23' data-id='JN4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_24' data-id='JN4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_25' data-id='JN4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_26' data-id='JN4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus declared, <span class='wj'>“I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Disciples Rejoin Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_27' data-id='JN4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_28' data-id='JN4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, </span>
<span class='v JN4_29' data-id='JN4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” </span>
<span class='v JN4_30' data-id='JN4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They came out of the town and made their way toward him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_31' data-id='JN4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, “Rabbi, eat something.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_32' data-id='JN4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, <span class='wj'>“I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_33' data-id='JN4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then his disciples said to each other, “Could someone have brought him food?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_34' data-id='JN4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“My food,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_35' data-id='JN4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Don’t you have a saying, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_36' data-id='JN4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and harvests a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_37' data-id='JN4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.</span></span>
<span class='v JN4_38' data-id='JN4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have reaped the benefits of their labor.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Many Samaritans Believe </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_39' data-id='JN4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_40' data-id='JN4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them, and he stayed two days. </span>
<span class='v JN4_41' data-id='JN4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And because of his words many more became believers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_42' data-id='JN4_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Savior of the world.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals an Official’s Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_43' data-id='JN4_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>After the two days he left for Galilee. </span>
<span class='v JN4_44' data-id='JN4_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>(Now Jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) </span>
<span class='v JN4_45' data-id='JN4_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him. They had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, for they also had been there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_46' data-id='JN4_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Once more he visited Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. And there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum. </span>
<span class='v JN4_47' data-id='JN4_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son, who was close to death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_48' data-id='JN4_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Unless you people see signs and wonders,”</span> Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“you will never believe.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_49' data-id='JN4_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The royal official said, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_50' data-id='JN4_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Go,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“your son will live.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_50' data-id='JN4_50'>The man took Jesus at his word and departed. </span>
<span class='v JN4_51' data-id='JN4_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>While he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living. </span>
<span class='v JN4_52' data-id='JN4_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>When he inquired as to the time when his son got better, they said to him, “Yesterday, at one in the afternoon, the fever left him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_53' data-id='JN4_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, <span class='wj'>“Your son will live.”</span> So he and his whole household believed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_54' data-id='JN4_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>This was the second sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee. </span></div></div>
