<div class='s'>Zelophehad’s Daughters </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_1' data-id='NU27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. The names of the daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah. They came forward </span>
<span class='v NU27_2' data-id='NU27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance to the tent of meeting and said, </span>
<span class='v NU27_3' data-id='NU27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among Korah’s followers, who banded together against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but he died for his own sin and left no sons. </span>
<span class='v NU27_4' data-id='NU27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Why should our father’s name disappear from his clan because he had no son? Give us property among our father’s relatives.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_5' data-id='NU27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So Moses brought their case before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span>
<span class='v NU27_6' data-id='NU27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, </span>
<span class='v NU27_7' data-id='NU27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“What Zelophehad’s daughters are saying is right. You must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their father’s relatives and give their father’s inheritance to them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_8' data-id='NU27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and leaves no son, give his inheritance to his daughter. </span>
<span class='v NU27_9' data-id='NU27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If he has no daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. </span>
<span class='v NU27_10' data-id='NU27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. </span>
<span class='v NU27_11' data-id='NU27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If his father had no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan, that he may possess it. This is to have the force of law for the Israelites, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Joshua to Succeed Moses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_12' data-id='NU27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go up this mountain in the Abarim Range and see the land I have given the Israelites. </span>
<span class='v NU27_13' data-id='NU27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>After you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron was, </span>
<span class='v NU27_14' data-id='NU27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>for when the community rebelled at the waters in the Desert of Zin, both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes.” (These were the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Desert of Zin.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_15' data-id='NU27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Moses said to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span>
<span class='v NU27_16' data-id='NU27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God who gives breath to all living things, appoint someone over this community </span>
<span class='v NU27_17' data-id='NU27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>to go out and come in before them, one who will lead them out and bring them in, so the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s people will not be like sheep without a shepherd.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_18' data-id='NU27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit of leadership,<span class='note' id='footnote-481'><a href='#note-481' class='key'>*</a></span> and lay your hand on him. </span>
<span class='v NU27_19' data-id='NU27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Have him stand before Eleazar the priest and the entire assembly and commission him in their presence. </span>
<span class='v NU27_20' data-id='NU27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Give him some of your authority so the whole Israelite community will obey him. </span>
<span class='v NU27_21' data-id='NU27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He is to stand before Eleazar the priest, who will obtain decisions for him by inquiring of the Urim before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. At his command he and the entire community of the Israelites will go out, and at his command they will come in.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU27_22' data-id='NU27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Moses did as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole assembly. </span>
<span class='v NU27_23' data-id='NU27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> instructed through Moses. </span></div></div>
