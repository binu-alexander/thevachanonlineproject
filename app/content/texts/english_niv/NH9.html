<div class='s'>The Israelites Confess Their Sins </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH9_1' data-id='NH9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the same month, the Israelites gathered together, fasting and wearing sackcloth and putting dust on their heads. </span>
<span class='v NH9_2' data-id='NH9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Those of Israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood in their places and confessed their sins and the sins of their ancestors. </span>
<span class='v NH9_3' data-id='NH9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They stood where they were and read from the Book of the Law of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God for a quarter of the day, and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God. </span>
<span class='v NH9_4' data-id='NH9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Standing on the stairs of the Levites were Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Kenani. They cried out with loud voices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God. </span>
<span class='v NH9_5' data-id='NH9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the Levites—Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah—said: “Stand up and praise the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, who is from everlasting to everlasting.<span class='note' id='footnote-1290'><a href='#note-1290' class='key'>*</a></span>” </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_6' data-id='NH9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You alone are the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. You made the heavens, even the highest heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them. You give life to everything, and the multitudes of heaven worship you. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_7' data-id='NH9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“You are the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God, who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans and named him Abraham. </span>
<span class='v NH9_8' data-id='NH9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You found his heart faithful to you, and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites and Girgashites. You have kept your promise because you are righteous. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_10' data-id='NH9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his officials and all the people of his land, for you knew how arrogantly the Egyptians treated them. You made a name for yourself, which remains to this day. </span>
<span class='v NH9_11' data-id='NH9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You divided the sea before them, so that they passed through it on dry ground, but you hurled their pursuers into the depths, like a stone into mighty waters. </span>
<span class='v NH9_12' data-id='NH9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>By day you led them with a pillar of cloud, and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_13' data-id='NH9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“You came down on Mount Sinai; you spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and laws that are just and right, and decrees and commands that are good. </span>
<span class='v NH9_14' data-id='NH9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You made known to them your holy Sabbath and gave them commands, decrees and laws through your servant Moses. </span>
<span class='v NH9_15' data-id='NH9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>In their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock; you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_16' data-id='NH9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“But they, our ancestors, became arrogant and stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commands. </span>
<span class='v NH9_17' data-id='NH9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them. They became stiff-necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in love. Therefore you did not desert them, </span>
<span class='v NH9_18' data-id='NH9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said, ‘This is your god, who brought you up out of Egypt,’ or when they committed awful blasphemies. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_19' data-id='NH9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the wilderness.

<span class='v NH9_20' data-id='NH9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You gave your good Spirit to instruct them. You did not withhold your manna from their mouths, and you gave them water for their thirst. </span>
<span class='v NH9_21' data-id='NH9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness; they lacked nothing, their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH9_22' data-id='NH9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“You gave them kingdoms and nations, allotting to them even the remotest frontiers.

<span class='v NH9_23' data-id='NH9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You made their children as numerous as the stars in the sky, and you brought them into the land that you told their parents to enter and possess. </span>
<span class='v NH9_24' data-id='NH9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Their children went in and took possession of the land. You subdued before them the Canaanites, who lived in the land; you gave the Canaanites into their hands, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, to deal with them as they pleased. </span>
<span class='v NH9_25' data-id='NH9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They captured fortified cities and fertile land; they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. They ate to the full and were well-nourished; they reveled in your great goodness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH9_26' data-id='NH9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>“But they were disobedient and rebelled against you; they turned their backs on your law. They killed your prophets, who had warned them in order to turn them back to you; they committed awful blasphemies. </span>
<span class='v NH9_27' data-id='NH9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So you delivered them into the hands of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed they cried out to you. From heaven you heard them, and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers, who rescued them from the hand of their enemies. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH9_28' data-id='NH9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“But as soon as they were at rest, they again did what was evil in your sight. Then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them. And when they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and in your compassion you delivered them time after time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH9_29' data-id='NH9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“You warned them in order to turn them back to your law, but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands. They sinned against your ordinances, of which you said, ‘The person who obeys them will live by them.’ Stubbornly they turned their backs on you, became stiff-necked and refused to listen. </span>
<span class='v NH9_30' data-id='NH9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For many years you were patient with them. By your Spirit you warned them through your prophets. Yet they paid no attention, so you gave them into the hands of the neighboring peoples. </span>
<span class='v NH9_31' data-id='NH9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them, for you are a gracious and merciful God. </span></div>

<span class='v NH9_33' data-id='NH9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we acted wickedly. </span>
<span class='v NH9_34' data-id='NH9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Our kings, our leaders, our priests and our ancestors did not follow your law; they did not pay attention to your commands or the statutes you warned them to keep. </span>
<span class='v NH9_35' data-id='NH9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Even while they were in their kingdom, enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them, they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways. </span></div>
