<span class='v C114_1' data-id='C114_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Follow the way of love and eagerly desire gifts of the Spirit, especially prophecy. </span>
<span class='v C114_2' data-id='C114_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For anyone who speaks in a tongue<span class='note' id='footnote-2996'><a href='#note-2996' class='key'>*</a></span> does not speak to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands them; they utter mysteries by the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v C114_3' data-id='C114_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouraging and comfort. </span>
<span class='v C114_4' data-id='C114_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Anyone who speaks in a tongue edifies themselves, but the one who prophesies edifies the church. </span>
<span class='v C114_5' data-id='C114_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I would like every one of you to speak in tongues,<span class='note' id='footnote-2997'><a href='#note-2997' class='key'>†</a></span> but I would rather have you prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues,<span class='note' id='footnote-2998'><a href='#note-2998' class='key'>‡</a></span> unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_6' data-id='C114_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you and speak in tongues, what good will I be to you, unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction? </span>
<span class='v C114_7' data-id='C114_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds, such as the pipe or harp, how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes? </span>
<span class='v C114_8' data-id='C114_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Again, if the trumpet does not sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle? </span>
<span class='v C114_9' data-id='C114_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air. </span>
<span class='v C114_10' data-id='C114_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning. </span>
<span class='v C114_11' data-id='C114_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If then I do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying, I am a foreigner to the speaker, and the speaker is a foreigner to me. </span>
<span class='v C114_12' data-id='C114_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So it is with you. Since you are eager for gifts of the Spirit, try to excel in those that build up the church. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_13' data-id='C114_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this reason the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret what they say. </span>
<span class='v C114_14' data-id='C114_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. </span>
<span class='v C114_15' data-id='C114_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So what shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my understanding. </span>
<span class='v C114_16' data-id='C114_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Otherwise when you are praising God in the Spirit, how can someone else, who is now put in the position of an inquirer,<span class='note' id='footnote-2999'><a href='#note-2999' class='key'>§</a></span> say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since they do not know what you are saying? </span>
<span class='v C114_17' data-id='C114_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You are giving thanks well enough, but no one else is edified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_18' data-id='C114_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. </span>
<span class='v C114_19' data-id='C114_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But in the church I would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_20' data-id='C114_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Brothers and sisters, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. </span>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In the Law it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'>“With other tongues </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'>and through the lips of foreigners </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'>I will speak to this people, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'>but even then they will not listen to me, </span></div>
<div class='qr'>says the Lord.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3000'><a href='#note-3000' class='key'>*</a></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_22' data-id='C114_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. </span>
<span class='v C114_23' data-id='C114_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? </span>
<span class='v C114_24' data-id='C114_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But if an unbeliever or an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of sin and are brought under judgment by all, </span>
<span class='v C114_25' data-id='C114_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>as the secrets of their hearts are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is really among you!” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Good Order in Worship </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_26' data-id='C114_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>What then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up. </span>
<span class='v C114_27' data-id='C114_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at a time, and someone must interpret. </span>
<span class='v C114_28' data-id='C114_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>If there is no interpreter, the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_29' data-id='C114_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said. </span>
<span class='v C114_30' data-id='C114_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first speaker should stop. </span>
<span class='v C114_31' data-id='C114_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged. </span>
<span class='v C114_32' data-id='C114_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets. </span>
<span class='v C114_33' data-id='C114_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all the congregations of the Lord’s people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_34' data-id='C114_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Women<span class='note' id='footnote-3001'><a href='#note-3001' class='key'>†</a></span> should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the law says. </span>
<span class='v C114_35' data-id='C114_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.<span class='note' id='footnote-3002'><a href='#note-3002' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_36' data-id='C114_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached? </span>
<span class='v C114_37' data-id='C114_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>If anyone thinks they are a prophet or otherwise gifted by the Spirit, let them acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. </span>
<span class='v C114_38' data-id='C114_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But if anyone ignores this, they will themselves be ignored.<span class='note' id='footnote-3003'><a href='#note-3003' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_39' data-id='C114_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. </span>
<span class='v C114_40' data-id='C114_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way. </span></div></div>
