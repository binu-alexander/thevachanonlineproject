<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_19' data-id='JN1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders<span class='note' id='footnote-2700'><a href='#note-2700' class='key'>‡</a></span> in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. </span>
<span class='v JN1_20' data-id='JN1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, “I am not the Messiah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'>He said, “I am not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'>“Are you the Prophet?” </span></div>

<span class='v JN1_21' data-id='JN1_21'>He answered, “No.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_22' data-id='JN1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Finally they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_23' data-id='JN1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, “I am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord.’ ”<span class='note' id='footnote-2701'><a href='#note-2701' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_24' data-id='JN1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now the Pharisees who had been sent </span>
<span class='v JN1_25' data-id='JN1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>questioned him, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?” </span></div>

<span class='v JN1_27' data-id='JN1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_28' data-id='JN1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. </span></div>
<div class='s'>John Testifies About Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_29' data-id='JN1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! </span>
<span class='v JN1_30' data-id='JN1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>This is the one I meant when I said, ‘A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.’ </span>
<span class='v JN1_31' data-id='JN1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_32' data-id='JN1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then John gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. </span>
<span class='v JN1_33' data-id='JN1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ </span>

<div class='s'>John’s Disciples Follow Jesus </div>

<span class='v JN1_35' data-id='JN1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN1_36' data-id='JN1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_37' data-id='JN1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN1_38' data-id='JN1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, <span class='wj'>“What do you want?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_38' data-id='JN1_38'>They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?” </span></div>

<span class='v JN1_39' data-id='JN1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Come,”</span> he replied, <span class='wj'>“and you will see.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_39' data-id='JN1_39'>So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_40' data-id='JN1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN1_41' data-id='JN1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, “We have found the Messiah” (that is, the Christ). </span>
<span class='v JN1_42' data-id='JN1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And he brought him to Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_42' data-id='JN1_42'>Jesus looked at him and said, <span class='wj'>“You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas”</span> (which, when translated, is Peter<span class='note' id='footnote-2704'><a href='#note-2704' class='key'>‡</a></span>). </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_43' data-id='JN1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Follow me.”</span></span></div>

<span class='v JN1_44' data-id='JN1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. </span>
<span class='v JN1_45' data-id='JN1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wrote—Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_46' data-id='JN1_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?” Nathanael asked. </span></div>

<span class='v JN1_46' data-id='JN1_46'>“Come and see,” said Philip. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_47' data-id='JN1_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, <span class='wj'>“Here truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN1_49' data-id='JN1_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Then Nathanael declared, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.” </span></div>
