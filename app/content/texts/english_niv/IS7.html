<div class='s'>The Sign of Immanuel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_1' data-id='IS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Ahaz son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel marched up to fight against Jerusalem, but they could not overpower it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_2' data-id='IS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now the house of David was told, “Aram has allied itself with<span class='note' id='footnote-1805'><a href='#note-1805' class='key'>*</a></span> Ephraim”; so the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken, as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_3' data-id='IS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Isaiah, “Go out, you and your son Shear-Jashub,<span class='note' id='footnote-1806'><a href='#note-1806' class='key'>†</a></span> to meet Ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field. </span>
<span class='v IS7_4' data-id='IS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Say to him, ‘Be careful, keep calm and don’t be afraid. Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and of the son of Remaliah. </span>
<span class='v IS7_5' data-id='IS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Aram, Ephraim and Remaliah’s son have plotted your ruin, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS7_6' data-id='IS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Let us invade Judah; let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves, and make the son of Tabeel king over it.” </span>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Yet this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'>“ ‘It will not take place, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_7' data-id='IS7_7'>it will not happen, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>for the head of Aram is Damascus, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'>and the head of Damascus is only Rezin. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'>Within sixty-five years </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_8' data-id='IS7_8'>Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>and the head of Samaria is only Remaliah’s son. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>If you do not stand firm in your faith, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS7_9' data-id='IS7_9'>you will not stand at all.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_10' data-id='IS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Again the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoke to Ahaz, </span>
<span class='v IS7_11' data-id='IS7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Ask the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God for a sign, whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_12' data-id='IS7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask; I will not put the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to the test.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_13' data-id='IS7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, you house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of humans? Will you try the patience of my God also? </span>
<span class='v IS7_14' data-id='IS7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Lord himself will give you<span class='note' id='footnote-1807'><a href='#note-1807' class='key'>‡</a></span> a sign: The virgin<span class='note' id='footnote-1808'><a href='#note-1808' class='key'>§</a></span> will conceive and give birth to a son, and<span class='note' id='footnote-1809'><a href='#note-1809' class='key'>*</a></span> will call him Immanuel.<span class='note' id='footnote-1810'><a href='#note-1810' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v IS7_15' data-id='IS7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He will be eating curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, </span>
<span class='v IS7_16' data-id='IS7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>for before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. </span>
<span class='v IS7_17' data-id='IS7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since Ephraim broke away from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Assyria, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s Instrument </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS7_18' data-id='IS7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In that day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will whistle for flies from the Nile delta in Egypt and for bees from the land of Assyria. </span>
<span class='v IS7_19' data-id='IS7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks, on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes. </span>
<span class='v IS7_20' data-id='IS7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In that day the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates River—the king of Assyria—to shave your heads and private parts, and to cut off your beards also. </span>
<span class='v IS7_21' data-id='IS7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In that day, a person will keep alive a young cow and two goats. </span>
<span class='v IS7_22' data-id='IS7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And because of the abundance of the milk they give, there will be curds to eat. All who remain in the land will eat curds and honey. </span>
<span class='v IS7_23' data-id='IS7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>In that day, in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels,<span class='note' id='footnote-1811'><a href='#note-1811' class='key'>‡</a></span> there will be only briers and thorns. </span>
<span class='v IS7_24' data-id='IS7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Hunters will go there with bow and arrow, for the land will be covered with briers and thorns. </span>
<span class='v IS7_25' data-id='IS7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe, you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns; they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run. </span></div></div>
