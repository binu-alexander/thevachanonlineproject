<span class='v EK46_6' data-id='EK46_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On the day of the New Moon he is to offer a young bull, six lambs and a ram, all without defect. </span>
<span class='v EK46_7' data-id='EK46_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He is to provide as a grain offering one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he wants to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah. </span>
<span class='v EK46_8' data-id='EK46_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the prince enters, he is to go in through the portico of the gateway, and he is to come out the same way. </span></div>

No one is to return through the gate by which they entered, but each is to go out the opposite gate. </span>
<span class='v EK46_10' data-id='EK46_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The prince is to be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out. </span>

<span class='v EK46_15' data-id='EK46_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering. </span></div>

<span class='v EK46_18' data-id='EK46_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property.

<span class='v EK46_19' data-id='EK46_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end. </span>
<span class='v EK46_20' data-id='EK46_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “This is the place where the priests are to cook the guilt offering and the sin offering<span class='note' id='footnote-2204'><a href='#note-2204' class='key'>*</a></span> and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK46_21' data-id='EK46_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court. </span>
<span class='v EK46_22' data-id='EK46_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed<span class='note' id='footnote-2205'><a href='#note-2205' class='key'>†</a></span> courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide;<span class='note' id='footnote-2206'><a href='#note-2206' class='key'>‡</a></span> each of the courts in the four corners was the same size. </span>
<span class='v EK46_23' data-id='EK46_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge. </span>
