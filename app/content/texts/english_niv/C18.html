<div class='s'>Concerning Food Sacrificed to Idols </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_1' data-id='C18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that “We all possess knowledge.” But knowledge puffs up while love builds up. </span>
<span class='v C18_2' data-id='C18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Those who think they know something do not yet know as they ought to know. </span>
<span class='v C18_3' data-id='C18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But whoever loves God is known by God.<span class='note' id='footnote-2978'><a href='#note-2978' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_4' data-id='C18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So then, about eating food sacrificed to idols: We know that “An idol is nothing at all in the world” and that “There is no God but one.” </span>
<span class='v C18_5' data-id='C18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”), </span>
<span class='v C18_6' data-id='C18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_7' data-id='C18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But not everyone possesses this knowledge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as having been sacrificed to a god, and since their conscience is weak, it is defiled. </span>
<span class='v C18_8' data-id='C18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But food does not bring us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C18_9' data-id='C18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be careful, however, that the exercise of your rights does not become a stumbling block to the weak. </span>
<span class='v C18_10' data-id='C18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For if someone with a weak conscience sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol’s temple, won’t that person be emboldened to eat what is sacrificed to idols? </span>
<span class='v C18_11' data-id='C18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So this weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your knowledge. </span>
<span class='v C18_12' data-id='C18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When you sin against them in this way and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ. </span>
<span class='v C18_13' data-id='C18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if what I eat causes my brother or sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause them to fall. </span></div></div>
