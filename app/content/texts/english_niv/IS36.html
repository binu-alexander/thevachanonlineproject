<div class='s'>Sennacherib Threatens Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_1' data-id='IS36_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah’s reign, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. </span>
<span class='v IS36_2' data-id='IS36_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Assyria sent his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. When the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field, </span>
<span class='v IS36_3' data-id='IS36_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went out to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_4' data-id='IS36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_4' data-id='IS36_4'>“ ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: On what are you basing this confidence of yours? </span>
<span class='v IS36_5' data-id='IS36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You say you have counsel and might for war—but you speak only empty words. On whom are you depending, that you rebel against me? </span>
<span class='v IS36_6' data-id='IS36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Look, I know you are depending on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it! Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who depend on him. </span>
<span class='v IS36_7' data-id='IS36_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But if you say to me, “We are depending on the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God”—isn’t he the one whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, saying to Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar”? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_8' data-id='IS36_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Come now, make a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses—if you can put riders on them! </span>
<span class='v IS36_9' data-id='IS36_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>How then can you repulse one officer of the least of my master’s officials, even though you are depending on Egypt for chariots and horsemen<span class='note' id='footnote-1863'><a href='#note-1863' class='key'>*</a></span>? </span>
<span class='v IS36_10' data-id='IS36_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, have I come to attack and destroy this land without the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>? The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> himself told me to march against this country and destroy it.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_11' data-id='IS36_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, since we understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_12' data-id='IS36_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the commander replied, “Was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things, and not to the people sitting on the wall—who, like you, will have to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_13' data-id='IS36_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the commander stood and called out in Hebrew, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! </span>
<span class='v IS36_14' data-id='IS36_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you! </span>
<span class='v IS36_15' data-id='IS36_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> when he says, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will surely deliver us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_16' data-id='IS36_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat fruit from your own vine and fig tree and drink water from your own cistern, </span>
<span class='v IS36_17' data-id='IS36_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>until I come and take you to a land like your own—a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_18' data-id='IS36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“Do not let Hezekiah mislead you when he says, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will deliver us.’ Have the gods of any nations ever delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria? </span>
<span class='v IS36_19' data-id='IS36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they rescued Samaria from my hand? </span>
<span class='v IS36_20' data-id='IS36_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Who of all the gods of these countries have been able to save their lands from me? How then can the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> deliver Jerusalem from my hand?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_21' data-id='IS36_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But the people remained silent and said nothing in reply, because the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS36_22' data-id='IS36_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah the palace administrator, Shebna the secretary and Joah son of Asaph the recorder went to Hezekiah, with their clothes torn, and told him what the field commander had said. </span></div></div>
