<div class='s'>Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_1' data-id='LK22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was approaching, </span>
<span class='v LK22_2' data-id='LK22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of Jesus, for they were afraid of the people. </span>
<span class='v LK22_3' data-id='LK22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Satan entered Judas, called Iscariot, one of the Twelve. </span>
<span class='v LK22_4' data-id='LK22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK22_5' data-id='LK22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They were delighted and agreed to give him money. </span>
<span class='v LK22_6' data-id='LK22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He consented, and watched for an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them when no crowd was present. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Last Supper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_7' data-id='LK22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. </span>
<span class='v LK22_8' data-id='LK22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span class='wj'>“Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_9' data-id='LK22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Where do you want us to prepare for it?” they asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_10' data-id='LK22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters, </span></span>
<span class='v LK22_11' data-id='LK22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_12' data-id='LK22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He will show you a large room upstairs, all furnished. Make preparations there.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_13' data-id='LK22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They left and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_14' data-id='LK22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table. </span>
<span class='v LK22_15' data-id='LK22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, <span class='wj'>“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_16' data-id='LK22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For I tell you, I will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_17' data-id='LK22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>After taking the cup, he gave thanks and said, <span class='wj'>“Take this and divide it among you.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_18' data-id='LK22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For I tell you I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_19' data-id='LK22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_20' data-id='LK22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In the same way, after the supper he took the cup, saying, <span class='wj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2689'><a href='#note-2689' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v LK22_21' data-id='LK22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_22' data-id='LK22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed. But woe to that man who betrays him!”</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_23' data-id='LK22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_24' data-id='LK22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest. </span>
<span class='v LK22_25' data-id='LK22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who exercise authority over them call themselves Benefactors.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_26' data-id='LK22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the one who rules like the one who serves.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_27' data-id='LK22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For who is greater, the one who is at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who is at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_28' data-id='LK22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You are those who have stood by me in my trials.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_29' data-id='LK22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me, </span></span>
<span class='v LK22_30' data-id='LK22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_31' data-id='LK22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_32' data-id='LK22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_33' data-id='LK22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_34' data-id='LK22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus asked them, <span class='wj'>“When I sent you without purse, bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_35' data-id='LK22_35'>“Nothing,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_36' data-id='LK22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“But now if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_37' data-id='LK22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>It is written: ‘And he was numbered with the transgressors’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2690'><a href='#note-2690' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_38' data-id='LK22_38'><span class='wj'>“That’s enough!”</span> he replied. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_39' data-id='LK22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_40' data-id='LK22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>On reaching the place, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_41' data-id='LK22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down and prayed, </span>
<span class='v LK22_42' data-id='LK22_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_43' data-id='LK22_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>An angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_44' data-id='LK22_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<span class='note' id='footnote-2691'><a href='#note-2691' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_45' data-id='LK22_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, he found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow. </span>
<span class='v LK22_46' data-id='LK22_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Why are you sleeping?”</span> he asked them. <span class='wj'>“Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Arrested </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_47' data-id='LK22_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking a crowd came up, and the man who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss him, </span>
<span class='v LK22_48' data-id='LK22_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>but Jesus asked him, <span class='wj'>“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_49' data-id='LK22_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>When Jesus’ followers saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_50' data-id='LK22_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_51' data-id='LK22_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“No more of this!”</span> And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_52' data-id='LK22_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders, who had come for him, <span class='wj'>“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_53' data-id='LK22_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Disowns Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_54' data-id='LK22_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. </span>
<span class='v LK22_55' data-id='LK22_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_56' data-id='LK22_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_57' data-id='LK22_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>But he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_58' data-id='LK22_58'>“Man, I am not!” Peter replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_59' data-id='LK22_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>About an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_60' data-id='LK22_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>Peter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. </span>
<span class='v LK22_61' data-id='LK22_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK22_62' data-id='LK22_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>And he went outside and wept bitterly. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_63' data-id='LK22_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating him. </span>
<span class='v LK22_64' data-id='LK22_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>They blindfolded him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” </span>
<span class='v LK22_65' data-id='LK22_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And they said many other insulting things to him. </span></div>

<span class='v LK22_66' data-id='LK22_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>At daybreak the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the teachers of the law, met together, and Jesus was led before them. </span>
<span class='v LK22_67' data-id='LK22_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<span class='v LK22_69' data-id='LK22_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK22_70' data-id='LK22_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” </span></div>
