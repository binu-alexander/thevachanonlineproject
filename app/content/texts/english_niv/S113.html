<div class='s'>Samuel Rebukes Saul </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_1' data-id='S113_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Saul was thirty<span class='note' id='footnote-704'><a href='#note-704' class='key'>*</a></span> years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-<span class='note' id='footnote-705'><a href='#note-705' class='key'>†</a></span>two years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_2' data-id='S113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Saul chose three thousand men from Israel; two thousand were with him at Mikmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. The rest of the men he sent back to their homes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_3' data-id='S113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said, “Let the Hebrews hear!” </span>
<span class='v S113_4' data-id='S113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked the Philistine outpost, and now Israel has become obnoxious to the Philistines.” And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_5' data-id='S113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Philistines assembled to fight Israel, with three thousand<span class='note' id='footnote-706'><a href='#note-706' class='key'>‡</a></span> chariots, six thousand charioteers, and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Mikmash, east of Beth Aven. </span>
<span class='v S113_6' data-id='S113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the Israelites saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed, they hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in pits and cisterns. </span>
<span class='v S113_7' data-id='S113_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_7' data-id='S113_7'>Saul remained at Gilgal, and all the troops with him were quaking with fear. </span>
<span class='v S113_8' data-id='S113_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He waited seven days, the time set by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and Saul’s men began to scatter. </span>
<span class='v S113_9' data-id='S113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” And Saul offered up the burnt offering. </span>
<span class='v S113_10' data-id='S113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Just as he finished making the offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_11' data-id='S113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“What have you done?” asked Samuel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_11' data-id='S113_11'>Saul replied, “When I saw that the men were scattering, and that you did not come at the set time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Mikmash, </span>
<span class='v S113_12' data-id='S113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s favor.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_13' data-id='S113_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“You have done a foolish thing,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time. </span>
<span class='v S113_14' data-id='S113_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But now your kingdom will not endure; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him ruler of his people, because you have not kept the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s command.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_15' data-id='S113_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel left Gilgal<span class='note' id='footnote-707'><a href='#note-707' class='key'>§</a></span> and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin, and Saul counted the men who were with him. They numbered about six hundred. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Israel Without Weapons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_16' data-id='S113_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Saul and his son Jonathan and the men with them were staying in Gibeah<span class='note' id='footnote-708'><a href='#note-708' class='key'>*</a></span> in Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Mikmash. </span>
<span class='v S113_17' data-id='S113_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Raiding parties went out from the Philistine camp in three detachments. One turned toward Ophrah in the vicinity of Shual, </span>
<span class='v S113_18' data-id='S113_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>another toward Beth Horon, and the third toward the borderland overlooking the Valley of Zeboyim facing the wilderness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_19' data-id='S113_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears!” </span>
<span class='v S113_20' data-id='S113_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow points, mattocks, axes and sickles<span class='note' id='footnote-709'><a href='#note-709' class='key'>†</a></span> sharpened. </span>
<span class='v S113_21' data-id='S113_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The price was two-thirds of a shekel<span class='note' id='footnote-710'><a href='#note-710' class='key'>‡</a></span> for sharpening plow points and mattocks, and a third of a shekel<span class='note' id='footnote-711'><a href='#note-711' class='key'>§</a></span> for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_22' data-id='S113_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So on the day of the battle not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand; only Saul and his son Jonathan had them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S113_23' data-id='S113_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now a detachment of Philistines had gone out to the pass at Mikmash. </span></div></div>
