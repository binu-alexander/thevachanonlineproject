<span class='v NU31_1' data-id='NU31_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU31_2' data-id='NU31_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. After that, you will be gathered to your people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU31_3' data-id='NU31_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s vengeance on them. </span>
<span class='v NU31_4' data-id='NU31_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.” </span>
<span class='v NU31_5' data-id='NU31_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So twelve thousand men armed for battle, a thousand from each tribe, were supplied from the clans of Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU31_6' data-id='NU31_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU31_7' data-id='NU31_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They fought against Midian, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses, and killed every man. </span>
<span class='v NU31_8' data-id='NU31_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Among their victims were Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba—the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword. </span>
<span class='v NU31_9' data-id='NU31_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks and goods as plunder. </span>
<span class='v NU31_10' data-id='NU31_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps. </span>
<span class='v NU31_11' data-id='NU31_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They took all the plunder and spoils, including the people and animals, </span>
<span class='v NU31_12' data-id='NU31_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and brought the captives, spoils and plunder to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the Israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan across from Jericho. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU31_13' data-id='NU31_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Moses, Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU31_14' data-id='NU31_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—who returned from the battle. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU31_15' data-id='NU31_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Have you allowed all the women to live?” he asked them. </span>
<span class='v NU31_16' data-id='NU31_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the Peor incident, so that a plague struck the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s people. </span>
<span class='v NU31_17' data-id='NU31_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now kill all the boys. And kill every woman who has slept with a man, </span>

<span class='v NU31_19' data-id='NU31_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Anyone who has killed someone or touched someone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days. On the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives. </span>
<span class='v NU31_20' data-id='NU31_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Purify every garment as well as everything made of leather, goat hair or wood.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU31_21' data-id='NU31_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle, “This is what is required by the law that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave Moses: </span>
<span class='v NU31_22' data-id='NU31_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, lead </span>
<span class='v NU31_23' data-id='NU31_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire, and then it will be clean. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. And whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water. </span>
<span class='v NU31_24' data-id='NU31_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>On the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.” </span></div>

<span class='v NU31_25' data-id='NU31_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>

<span class='v NU31_27' data-id='NU31_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community. </span>
<span class='v NU31_28' data-id='NU31_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>From the soldiers who fought in the battle, set apart as tribute for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> one out of every five hundred, whether people, cattle, donkeys or sheep. </span>
<span class='v NU31_29' data-id='NU31_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Take this tribute from their half share and give it to Eleazar the priest as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s part. </span>
<span class='v NU31_30' data-id='NU31_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>From the Israelites’ half, select one out of every fifty, whether people, cattle, donkeys, sheep or other animals.

<span class='v NU31_31' data-id='NU31_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>

<span class='v NU31_48' data-id='NU31_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then the officers who were over the units of the army—the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds—went to Moses </span>
