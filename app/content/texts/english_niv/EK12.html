<span class='v EK12_1' data-id='EK12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK12_2' data-id='EK12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious people. They have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK12_3' data-id='EK12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, son of man, pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime, as they watch, set out and go from where you are to another place. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious people. </span>
<span class='v EK12_4' data-id='EK12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>During the daytime, while they watch, bring out your belongings packed for exile. Then in the evening, while they are watching, go out like those who go into exile. </span>
<span class='v EK12_5' data-id='EK12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>While they watch, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it. </span>
<span class='v EK12_6' data-id='EK12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the Israelites.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK12_7' data-id='EK12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I did as I was commanded. During the day I brought out my things packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I took my belongings out at dusk, carrying them on my shoulders while they watched. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK12_8' data-id='EK12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the morning the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK12_9' data-id='EK12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, did not the Israelites, that rebellious people, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’ </span></div>

<span class='v EK12_13' data-id='EK12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare; I will bring him to Babylonia, the land of the Chaldeans, but he will not see it, and there he will die. </span>
<span class='v EK12_14' data-id='EK12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will scatter to the winds all those around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with drawn sword. </span></div>

<span class='v EK12_17' data-id='EK12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>

<span class='v EK12_19' data-id='EK12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Say to the people of the land: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says about those living in Jerusalem and in the land of Israel: They will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair, for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there. </span>
<span class='v EK12_20' data-id='EK12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ ” </span></div>

<span class='v EK12_23' data-id='EK12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am going to put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Say to them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled. </span>
<span class='v EK12_24' data-id='EK12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of Israel. </span>
