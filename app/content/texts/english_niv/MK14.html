<div class='s'>Jesus Anointed at Bethany </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_1' data-id='MK14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were only two days away, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were scheming to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. </span>
<span class='v MK14_2' data-id='MK14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“But not during the festival,” they said, “or the people may riot.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_3' data-id='MK14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>While he was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the home of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_4' data-id='MK14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Some of those present were saying indignantly to one another, “Why this waste of perfume? </span>
<span class='v MK14_5' data-id='MK14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It could have been sold for more than a year’s wages<span class='note' id='footnote-2608'><a href='#note-2608' class='key'>*</a></span> and the money given to the poor.” And they rebuked her harshly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_6' data-id='MK14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Leave her alone,”</span> said Jesus. <span class='wj'>“Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span></span>

<span class='v MK14_8' data-id='MK14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial.</span></span>
<span class='v MK14_9' data-id='MK14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_10' data-id='MK14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Jesus to them. </span>
<span class='v MK14_11' data-id='MK14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money. So he watched for an opportunity to hand him over. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Last Supper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_12' data-id='MK14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_13' data-id='MK14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So he sent two of his disciples, telling them, <span class='wj'>“Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him.</span></span>
<span class='v MK14_14' data-id='MK14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_16' data-id='MK14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The disciples left, went into the city and found things just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_17' data-id='MK14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. </span>
<span class='v MK14_18' data-id='MK14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>While they were reclining at the table eating, he said, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_19' data-id='MK14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely you don’t mean me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_20' data-id='MK14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“It is one of the Twelve,”</span> he replied, <span class='wj'>“one who dips bread into the bowl with me.</span></span>
<span class='v MK14_21' data-id='MK14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_22' data-id='MK14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, <span class='wj'>“Take it; this is my body.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_23' data-id='MK14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it. </span></div>

<span class='v MK14_25' data-id='MK14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, I will not drink again from the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_26' data-id='MK14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_29' data-id='MK14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Peter declared, “Even if all fall away, I will not.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_31' data-id='MK14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Gethsemane </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_32' data-id='MK14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They went to a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Sit here while I pray.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK14_33' data-id='MK14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He took Peter, James and John along with him, and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled. </span>
<span class='v MK14_34' data-id='MK14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death,”</span> he said to them. <span class='wj'>“Stay here and keep watch.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_35' data-id='MK14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Going a little farther, he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_37' data-id='MK14_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. <span class='wj'>“Simon,”</span> he said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“are you asleep? Couldn’t you keep watch for one hour?</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_39' data-id='MK14_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Once more he went away and prayed the same thing. </span>
<span class='v MK14_40' data-id='MK14_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They did not know what to say to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_41' data-id='MK14_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Returning the third time, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</span></span>

<div class='s'>Jesus Arrested </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_43' data-id='MK14_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_44' data-id='MK14_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.” </span>
<span class='v MK14_45' data-id='MK14_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him. </span>
<span class='v MK14_46' data-id='MK14_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>The men seized Jesus and arrested him. </span>
<span class='v MK14_47' data-id='MK14_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_48' data-id='MK14_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Am I leading a rebellion,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me?</span></span>

<span class='v MK14_50' data-id='MK14_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Then everyone deserted him and fled. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_51' data-id='MK14_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, </span>

<div class='s'>Jesus Before the Sanhedrin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_53' data-id='MK14_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders and the teachers of the law came together. </span>
<span class='v MK14_54' data-id='MK14_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_55' data-id='MK14_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find any. </span>
<span class='v MK14_56' data-id='MK14_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Many testified falsely against him, but their statements did not agree. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_57' data-id='MK14_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: </span>
<span class='v MK14_58' data-id='MK14_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, not made with hands.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MK14_59' data-id='MK14_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>Yet even then their testimony did not agree. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_60' data-id='MK14_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” </span>
<span class='v MK14_61' data-id='MK14_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_61' data-id='MK14_61'>Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_62' data-id='MK14_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I am,”</span> said Jesus. <span class='wj'>“And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_63' data-id='MK14_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>The high priest tore his clothes. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked. </span>
<span class='v MK14_64' data-id='MK14_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>“You have heard the blasphemy. What do you think?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_64' data-id='MK14_64'>They all condemned him as worthy of death. </span>
<span class='v MK14_65' data-id='MK14_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Then some began to spit at him; they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Disowns Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_66' data-id='MK14_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came by. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_67' data-id='MK14_67'>“You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK14_68' data-id='MK14_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>But he denied it. “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.<span class='note' id='footnote-2614'><a href='#note-2614' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
