<div class='s'>The Remnant of Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_1' data-id='RM11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I ask then: Did God reject his people? By no means! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v RM11_2' data-id='RM11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>God did not reject his people, whom he foreknew. Don’t you know what Scripture says in the passage about Elijah—how he appealed to God against Israel: </span>
<span class='v RM11_3' data-id='RM11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars; I am the only one left, and they are trying to kill me”<span class='note' id='footnote-2922'><a href='#note-2922' class='key'>*</a></span>? </span>
<span class='v RM11_4' data-id='RM11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And what was God’s answer to him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2923'><a href='#note-2923' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM11_5' data-id='RM11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. </span>
<span class='v RM11_6' data-id='RM11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And if by grace, then it cannot be based on works; if it were, grace would no longer be grace. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_7' data-id='RM11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, </span>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>as it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>“God gave them a spirit of stupor, </span></div>

<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>eyes that could not see </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>to this very day.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2924'><a href='#note-2924' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And David says: </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'>a stumbling block and a retribution for them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_10' data-id='RM11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_10' data-id='RM11_10'>and their backs be bent forever.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2925'><a href='#note-2925' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Ingrafted Branches </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_11' data-id='RM11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Again I ask: Did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Not at all! Rather, because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious. </span>
<span class='v RM11_12' data-id='RM11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_13' data-id='RM11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I am talking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I take pride in my ministry </span>
<span class='v RM11_14' data-id='RM11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>in the hope that I may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them. </span>
<span class='v RM11_15' data-id='RM11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For if their rejection brought reconciliation to the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? </span>
<span class='v RM11_16' data-id='RM11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_17' data-id='RM11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If some of the branches have been broken off, and you, though a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root, </span>
<span class='v RM11_18' data-id='RM11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>do not consider yourself to be superior to those other branches. If you do, consider this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you. </span>
<span class='v RM11_19' data-id='RM11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” </span>
<span class='v RM11_20' data-id='RM11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but tremble. </span>
<span class='v RM11_21' data-id='RM11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_22' data-id='RM11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off. </span>
<span class='v RM11_23' data-id='RM11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. </span>
<span class='v RM11_24' data-id='RM11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After all, if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree! </span></div>
<div class='s'>All Israel Will Be Saved </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_25' data-id='RM11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, </span>

<span class='v RM11_29' data-id='RM11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>for God’s gifts and his call are irrevocable. </span>
<span class='v RM11_30' data-id='RM11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Just as you who were at one time disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience, </span>

<span class='v RM11_32' data-id='RM11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all. </span></div>
