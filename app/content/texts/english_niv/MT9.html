<div class='s'>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_1' data-id='MT9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus stepped into a boat, crossed over and came to his own town. </span>
<span class='v MT9_2' data-id='MT9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some men brought to him a paralyzed man, lying on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_3' data-id='MT9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>At this, some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_4' data-id='MT9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts?</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_5' data-id='MT9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_6' data-id='MT9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”</span> So he said to the paralyzed man, <span class='wj'>“Get up, take your mat and go home.”</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_7' data-id='MT9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the man got up and went home. </span>
<span class='v MT9_8' data-id='MT9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the crowd saw this, they were filled with awe; and they praised God, who had given such authority to man. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Calling of Matthew </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_9' data-id='MT9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. <span class='wj'>“Follow me,”</span> he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_10' data-id='MT9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT9_11' data-id='MT9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_12' data-id='MT9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_13' data-id='MT9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2474'><a href='#note-2474' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Questioned About Fasting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_14' data-id='MT9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then John’s disciples came and asked him, “How is it that we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_15' data-id='MT9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; then they will fast.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_16' data-id='MT9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_17' data-id='MT9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Neither do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_18' data-id='MT9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>While he was saying this, a synagogue leader came and knelt before him and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and put your hand on her, and she will live.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_19' data-id='MT9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus got up and went with him, and so did his disciples. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_20' data-id='MT9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. </span>
<span class='v MT9_21' data-id='MT9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_22' data-id='MT9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus turned and saw her. <span class='wj'>“Take heart, daughter,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“your faith has healed you.”</span> And the woman was healed at that moment. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_23' data-id='MT9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When Jesus entered the synagogue leader’s house and saw the noisy crowd and people playing pipes, </span>
<span class='v MT9_24' data-id='MT9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>he said, <span class='wj'>“Go away. The girl is not dead but asleep.”</span> But they laughed at him. </span>
<span class='v MT9_25' data-id='MT9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up. </span>
<span class='v MT9_26' data-id='MT9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>News of this spread through all that region. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals the Blind and the Mute </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_27' data-id='MT9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_28' data-id='MT9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Do you believe that I am able to do this?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_28' data-id='MT9_28'>“Yes, Lord,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_29' data-id='MT9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then he touched their eyes and said, <span class='wj'>“According to your faith let it be done to you”;</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_30' data-id='MT9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>and their sight was restored. Jesus warned them sternly, <span class='wj'>“See that no one knows about this.”</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_31' data-id='MT9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But they went out and spread the news about him all over that region. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_32' data-id='MT9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>While they were going out, a man who was demon-possessed and could not talk was brought to Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT9_33' data-id='MT9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And when the demon was driven out, the man who had been mute spoke. The crowd was amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_34' data-id='MT9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees said, “It is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Workers Are Few </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_35' data-id='MT9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. </span>
<span class='v MT9_36' data-id='MT9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. </span>
<span class='v MT9_37' data-id='MT9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then he said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.</span></span>
<span class='v MT9_38' data-id='MT9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.”</span></span></div></div>
