<span class='v RV16_10' data-id='RV16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in agony </span>
<span class='v RV16_11' data-id='RV16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done. </span></div>

<span class='v RV16_12' data-id='RV16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. </span>
<span class='v RV16_13' data-id='RV16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then I saw three impure spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. </span>
