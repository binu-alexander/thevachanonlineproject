<div class='s'>Jonah’s Anger at the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s Compassion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_1' data-id='JH4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But to Jonah this seemed very wrong, and he became angry. </span>
<span class='v JH4_2' data-id='JH4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “Isn’t this what I said, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, when I was still at home? That is what I tried to forestall by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and abounding in love, a God who relents from sending calamity. </span>
<span class='v JH4_3' data-id='JH4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, take away my life, for it is better for me to die than to live.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_4' data-id='JH4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> replied, “Is it right for you to be angry?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_5' data-id='JH4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jonah had gone out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city. </span>
<span class='v JH4_6' data-id='JH4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God provided a leafy plant<span class='note' id='footnote-2345'><a href='#note-2345' class='key'>*</a></span> and made it grow up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was very happy about the plant. </span>
<span class='v JH4_7' data-id='JH4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But at dawn the next day God provided a worm, which chewed the plant so that it withered. </span>
<span class='v JH4_8' data-id='JH4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun blazed on Jonah’s head so that he grew faint. He wanted to die, and said, “It would be better for me to die than to live.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_9' data-id='JH4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_9' data-id='JH4_9'>“It is,” he said. “And I’m so angry I wish I were dead.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH4_10' data-id='JH4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and died overnight. </span>
<span class='v JH4_11' data-id='JH4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—and also many animals?” </span></div></div>
