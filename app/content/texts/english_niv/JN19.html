<div class='s'>Jesus Sentenced to Be Crucified </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_1' data-id='JN19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. </span>
<span class='v JN19_2' data-id='JN19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They clothed him in a purple robe </span>
<span class='v JN19_3' data-id='JN19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and went up to him again and again, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!” And they slapped him in the face. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_4' data-id='JN19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews gathered there, “Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him.” </span>
<span class='v JN19_5' data-id='JN19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_6' data-id='JN19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>As soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him, they shouted, “Crucify! Crucify!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_6' data-id='JN19_6'>But Pilate answered, “You take him and crucify him. As for me, I find no basis for a charge against him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_7' data-id='JN19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The Jewish leaders insisted, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_8' data-id='JN19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid, </span>
<span class='v JN19_9' data-id='JN19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and he went back inside the palace. “Where do you come from?” he asked Jesus, but Jesus gave him no answer. </span>
<span class='v JN19_10' data-id='JN19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Do you refuse to speak to me?” Pilate said. “Don’t you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_11' data-id='JN19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_12' data-id='JN19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>From then on, Pilate tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders kept shouting, “If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_13' data-id='JN19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at a place known as the Stone Pavement (which in Aramaic is Gabbatha). </span>
<span class='v JN19_14' data-id='JN19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>It was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about noon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_14' data-id='JN19_14'>“Here is your king,” Pilate said to the Jews. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_15' data-id='JN19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But they shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_15' data-id='JN19_15'>“Shall I crucify your king?” Pilate asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_15' data-id='JN19_15'>“We have no king but Caesar,” the chief priests answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Finally Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'>The Crucifixion of Jesus </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_16' data-id='JN19_16'>So the soldiers took charge of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN19_17' data-id='JN19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Carrying his own cross, he went out to the place of the Skull (which in Aramaic is called Golgotha). </span>
<span class='v JN19_18' data-id='JN19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There they crucified him, and with him two others—one on each side and Jesus in the middle. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_19' data-id='JN19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read: <span class='sc'>jesus of nazareth</span>, <span class='sc'>the king of the jews</span>. </span>
<span class='v JN19_20' data-id='JN19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. </span>
<span class='v JN19_21' data-id='JN19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_22' data-id='JN19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_23' data-id='JN19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes, dividing them into four shares, one for each of them, with the undergarment remaining. This garment was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Let’s not tear it,” they said to one another. “Let’s decide by lot who will get it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>This happened that the scripture might be fulfilled that said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>“They divided my clothes among them </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>and cast lots for my garment.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2769'><a href='#note-2769' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN19_24' data-id='JN19_24'>So this is what the soldiers did. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_25' data-id='JN19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. </span>
<span class='v JN19_26' data-id='JN19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw his mother there, and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2770'><a href='#note-2770' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>here is your son,”</span></span>
<span class='v JN19_27' data-id='JN19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and to the disciple, <span class='wj'>“Here is your mother.”</span> From that time on, this disciple took her into his home. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_28' data-id='JN19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Later, knowing that everything had now been finished, and so that Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I am thirsty.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN19_29' data-id='JN19_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>A jar of wine vinegar was there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ lips. </span>
<span class='v JN19_30' data-id='JN19_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When he had received the drink, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“It is finished.”</span> With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_31' data-id='JN19_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Now it was the day of Preparation, and the next day was to be a special Sabbath. Because the Jewish leaders did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the Sabbath, they asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down. </span>
<span class='v JN19_32' data-id='JN19_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and then those of the other. </span>
<span class='v JN19_33' data-id='JN19_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But when they came to Jesus and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. </span>
<span class='v JN19_34' data-id='JN19_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Instead, one of the soldiers pierced Jesus’ side with a spear, bringing a sudden flow of blood and water. </span>
<span class='v JN19_35' data-id='JN19_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The man who saw it has given testimony, and his testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, and he testifies so that you also may believe. </span>
<span class='v JN19_36' data-id='JN19_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>These things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”<span class='note' id='footnote-2771'><a href='#note-2771' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN19_37' data-id='JN19_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and, as another scripture says, “They will look on the one they have pierced.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2772'><a href='#note-2772' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Burial of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN19_38' data-id='JN19_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away. </span>
<span class='v JN19_39' data-id='JN19_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.<span class='note' id='footnote-2773'><a href='#note-2773' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN19_40' data-id='JN19_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Taking Jesus’ body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with Jewish burial customs. </span>
<span class='v JN19_41' data-id='JN19_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>At the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid. </span>
<span class='v JN19_42' data-id='JN19_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and since the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there. </span></div></div>
