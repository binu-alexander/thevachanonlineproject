<span class='v RM1_2' data-id='RM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures </span>
<span class='v RM1_3' data-id='RM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>regarding his Son, who as to his earthly life<span class='note' id='footnote-2855'><a href='#note-2855' class='key'>*</a></span> was a descendant of David, </span>
<span class='v RM1_4' data-id='RM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and who through the Spirit of holiness was appointed the Son of God in power<span class='note' id='footnote-2856'><a href='#note-2856' class='key'>†</a></span> by his resurrection from the dead: Jesus Christ our Lord. </span>
<span class='v RM1_5' data-id='RM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Through him we received grace and apostleship to call all the Gentiles to the obedience that comes from<span class='note' id='footnote-2857'><a href='#note-2857' class='key'>‡</a></span> faith for his name’s sake. </span>
<span class='v RM1_6' data-id='RM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you also are among those Gentiles who are called to belong to Jesus Christ. </span></div>

<div class='s'>Paul’s Longing to Visit Rome </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_8' data-id='RM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being reported all over the world. </span>
<span class='v RM1_9' data-id='RM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>God, whom I serve in my spirit in preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I remember you </span>
<span class='v RM1_10' data-id='RM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>in my prayers at all times; and I pray that now at last by God’s will the way may be opened for me to come to you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_11' data-id='RM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I long to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong— </span>
<span class='v RM1_12' data-id='RM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>that is, that you and I may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith. </span>
<span class='v RM1_13' data-id='RM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters,<span class='note' id='footnote-2858'><a href='#note-2858' class='key'>§</a></span> that I planned many times to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now) in order that I might have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_14' data-id='RM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am obligated both to Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish. </span>
<span class='v RM1_15' data-id='RM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>That is why I am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_16' data-id='RM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile. </span>
<span class='v RM1_17' data-id='RM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last,<span class='note' id='footnote-2859'><a href='#note-2859' class='key'>*</a></span> just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2860'><a href='#note-2860' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>God’s Wrath Against Sinful Humanity </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_18' data-id='RM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, </span>
<span class='v RM1_19' data-id='RM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. </span>
<span class='v RM1_20' data-id='RM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_21' data-id='RM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. </span>
<span class='v RM1_22' data-id='RM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools </span>
<span class='v RM1_23' data-id='RM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_24' data-id='RM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. </span>
<span class='v RM1_25' data-id='RM1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_26' data-id='RM1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. </span>
<span class='v RM1_27' data-id='RM1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_28' data-id='RM1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. </span>
<span class='v RM1_29' data-id='RM1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, </span>
<span class='v RM1_30' data-id='RM1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; </span>
<span class='v RM1_31' data-id='RM1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy. </span>
<span class='v RM1_32' data-id='RM1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them. </span></div></div>
