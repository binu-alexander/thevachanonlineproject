<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s Covenant With Abram </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_1' data-id='GN15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Abram in a vision: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN15_1' data-id='GN15_1'>“Do not be afraid, Abram. </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN15_1' data-id='GN15_1'>I am your shield,<span class='note' id='footnote-59'><a href='#note-59' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN15_1' data-id='GN15_1'>your very great reward.<span class='note' id='footnote-60'><a href='#note-60' class='key'>†</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_2' data-id='GN15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But Abram said, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, what can you give me since I remain childless and the one who will inherit<span class='note' id='footnote-61'><a href='#note-61' class='key'>‡</a></span> my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?” </span>
<span class='v GN15_3' data-id='GN15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Abram said, “You have given me no children; so a servant in my household will be my heir.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_4' data-id='GN15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” </span>
<span class='v GN15_5' data-id='GN15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring<span class='note' id='footnote-62'><a href='#note-62' class='key'>§</a></span> be.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_6' data-id='GN15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Abram believed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he credited it to him as righteousness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_7' data-id='GN15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He also said to him, “I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_8' data-id='GN15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Abram said, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, how can I know that I will gain possession of it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_9' data-id='GN15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Bring me a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_10' data-id='GN15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Abram brought all these to him, cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other; the birds, however, he did not cut in half. </span>
<span class='v GN15_11' data-id='GN15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_12' data-id='GN15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him. </span>
<span class='v GN15_13' data-id='GN15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Know for certain that for four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and that they will be enslaved and mistreated there. </span>
<span class='v GN15_14' data-id='GN15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will come out with great possessions. </span>
<span class='v GN15_15' data-id='GN15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. </span>
<span class='v GN15_16' data-id='GN15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the fourth generation your descendants will come back here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN15_17' data-id='GN15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces. </span>
<span class='v GN15_18' data-id='GN15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>On that day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the Wadi<span class='note' id='footnote-63'><a href='#note-63' class='key'>*</a></span> of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates— </span>
<span class='v GN15_19' data-id='GN15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, </span>
<span class='v GN15_20' data-id='GN15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, </span>
<span class='v GN15_21' data-id='GN15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.” </span></div></div>
