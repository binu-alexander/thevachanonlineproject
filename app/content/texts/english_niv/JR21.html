<span class='v JR21_1' data-id='JR21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur son of Malkijah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah. They said: </span>
<span class='v JR21_2' data-id='JR21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Inquire now of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for us because Nebuchadnezzar<span class='note' id='footnote-1943'><a href='#note-1943' class='key'>*</a></span> king of Babylon is attacking us. Perhaps the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR21_3' data-id='JR21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell Zedekiah, </span>
<span class='v JR21_4' data-id='JR21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight the king of Babylon and the Babylonians<span class='note' id='footnote-1944'><a href='#note-1944' class='key'>†</a></span> who are outside the wall besieging you. And I will gather them inside this city. </span>
<span class='v JR21_5' data-id='JR21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in furious anger and in great wrath. </span>
<span class='v JR21_6' data-id='JR21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will strike down those who live in this city—both man and beast—and they will die of a terrible plague. </span>
<span class='v JR21_7' data-id='JR21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After that, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague, sword and famine, into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to their enemies who want to kill them. He will put them to the sword; he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR21_8' data-id='JR21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Furthermore, tell the people, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: See, I am setting before you the way of life and the way of death. </span>

<span class='v JR21_11' data-id='JR21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Moreover, say to the royal house of Judah, ‘Hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
