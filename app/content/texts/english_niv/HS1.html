<span class='v HS1_2' data-id='HS1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> began to speak through Hosea, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Go, marry a promiscuous woman and have children with her, for like an adulterous wife this land is guilty of unfaithfulness to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span>
<span class='v HS1_3' data-id='HS1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So he married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. </span></div>

<span class='v HS1_4' data-id='HS1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Hosea, “Call him Jezreel, because I will soon punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of Israel. </span>
<span class='v HS1_5' data-id='HS1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.” </span></div>

<span class='v HS1_6' data-id='HS1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Hosea, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah (which means “not loved”), for I will no longer show love to Israel, that I should at all forgive them. </span>
<span class='v HS1_7' data-id='HS1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Yet I will show love to Judah; and I will save them—not by bow, sword or battle, or by horses and horsemen, but I, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God, will save them.” </span></div>
