<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH12_38' data-id='NH12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The second choir proceeded in the opposite direction.

<span class='v NH12_40' data-id='NH12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>The two choirs that gave thanks then took their places in the house of God; so did I, together with half the officials, </span>
<span class='v NH12_41' data-id='NH12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>as well as the priests—Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah and Hananiah with their trumpets— </span>
<span class='v NH12_42' data-id='NH12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam and Ezer. The choirs sang under the direction of Jezrahiah. </span>
<span class='v NH12_43' data-id='NH12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And on that day they offered great sacrifices, rejoicing because God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The sound of rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard far away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH12_44' data-id='NH12_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>At that time men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits and tithes. From the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the Law for the priests and the Levites, for Judah was pleased with the ministering priests and Levites. </span>
<span class='v NH12_45' data-id='NH12_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as did also the musicians and gatekeepers, according to the commands of David and his son Solomon. </span>
<span class='v NH12_46' data-id='NH12_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the musicians and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. </span>
<span class='v NH12_47' data-id='NH12_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>So in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel contributed the daily portions for the musicians and the gatekeepers. They also set aside the portion for the other Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron. </span></div></div>
