<div class='s'>Imitating Christ’s Humility </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_1' data-id='PP2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, </span>
<span class='v PP2_2' data-id='PP2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of one mind. </span>
<span class='v PP2_3' data-id='PP2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, </span>
<span class='v PP2_4' data-id='PP2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_5' data-id='PP2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_6' data-id='PP2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who, being in very nature<span class='note' id='footnote-3089'><a href='#note-3089' class='key'>*</a></span> God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_6' data-id='PP2_6'>did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>rather, he made himself nothing </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'>by taking the very nature<span class='note' id='footnote-3090'><a href='#note-3090' class='key'>†</a></span> of a servant, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_7' data-id='PP2_7'>being made in human likeness. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And being found in appearance as a man, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'>he humbled himself </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'>by becoming obedient to death— </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v PP2_8' data-id='PP2_8'>even death on a cross! </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_9' data-id='PP2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Therefore God exalted him to the highest place </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_9' data-id='PP2_9'>and gave him the name that is above every name, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_10' data-id='PP2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_10' data-id='PP2_10'>in heaven and on earth and under the earth, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PP2_11' data-id='PP2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v PP2_11' data-id='PP2_11'>to the glory of God the Father. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Do Everything Without Grumbling </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_12' data-id='PP2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed—not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence—continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, </span>
<span class='v PP2_13' data-id='PP2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_14' data-id='PP2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do everything without grumbling or arguing, </span>
<span class='v PP2_15' data-id='PP2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>so that you may become blameless and pure, “children of God without fault in a warped and crooked generation.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3091'><a href='#note-3091' class='key'>‡</a></span> Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky </span>
<span class='v PP2_16' data-id='PP2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain. </span>
<span class='v PP2_17' data-id='PP2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_18' data-id='PP2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So you too should be glad and rejoice with me. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Timothy and Epaphroditus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_19' data-id='PP2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I receive news about you. </span>
<span class='v PP2_20' data-id='PP2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I have no one else like him, who will show genuine concern for your welfare. </span>
<span class='v PP2_21' data-id='PP2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For everyone looks out for their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP2_22' data-id='PP2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But you know that Timothy has proved himself, because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP2_23' data-id='PP2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I hope, therefore, to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. </span>
<span class='v PP2_24' data-id='PP2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And I am confident in the Lord that I myself will come soon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP2_25' data-id='PP2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But I think it is necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger, whom you sent to take care of my needs. </span>
<span class='v PP2_26' data-id='PP2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill. </span>
<span class='v PP2_27' data-id='PP2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow. </span>
<span class='v PP2_28' data-id='PP2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have less anxiety. </span>
<span class='v PP2_29' data-id='PP2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So then, welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, </span>
<span class='v PP2_30' data-id='PP2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to make up for the help you yourselves could not give me. </span></div></div>
