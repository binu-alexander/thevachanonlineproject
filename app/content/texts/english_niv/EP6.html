<span class='v EP6_1' data-id='EP6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. </span>
<span class='v EP6_2' data-id='EP6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Honor your father and mother”—which is the first commandment with a promise— </span>
<span class='v EP6_3' data-id='EP6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3080'><a href='#note-3080' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP6_4' data-id='EP6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Fathers,<span class='note' id='footnote-3081'><a href='#note-3081' class='key'>†</a></span> do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP6_5' data-id='EP6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. </span>
<span class='v EP6_6' data-id='EP6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. </span>
<span class='v EP6_7' data-id='EP6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, </span>
<span class='v EP6_8' data-id='EP6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP6_9' data-id='EP6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Armor of God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP6_10' data-id='EP6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. </span>
<span class='v EP6_11' data-id='EP6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. </span>
<span class='v EP6_12' data-id='EP6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. </span>
<span class='v EP6_13' data-id='EP6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. </span>
<span class='v EP6_14' data-id='EP6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, </span>
<span class='v EP6_15' data-id='EP6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. </span>
<span class='v EP6_16' data-id='EP6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. </span>
<span class='v EP6_17' data-id='EP6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP6_18' data-id='EP6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. </span>
<span class='v EP6_19' data-id='EP6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, </span>
