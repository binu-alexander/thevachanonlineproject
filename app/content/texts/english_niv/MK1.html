<span class='v MK1_5' data-id='MK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River. </span>

<div class='s'>The Baptism and Testing of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_9' data-id='MK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v MK1_10' data-id='MK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. </span>

<div class='s'>Jesus Announces the Good News </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_14' data-id='MK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. </span>
<span class='v MK1_15' data-id='MK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The time has come,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calls His First Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_16' data-id='MK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class='v MK1_17' data-id='MK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Come, follow me,”</span> Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“and I will send you out to fish for people.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK1_18' data-id='MK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>At once they left their nets and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_19' data-id='MK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. </span>
<span class='v MK1_20' data-id='MK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Drives Out an Impure Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_21' data-id='MK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. </span>
<span class='v MK1_22' data-id='MK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the teachers of the law. </span>
<span class='v MK1_23' data-id='MK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, </span>
<span class='v MK1_24' data-id='MK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_25' data-id='MK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Be quiet!”</span> said Jesus sternly. <span class='wj'>“Come out of him!”</span></span>
<span class='v MK1_26' data-id='MK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_27' data-id='MK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—and with authority! He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_28' data-id='MK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_29' data-id='MK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. </span>
<span class='v MK1_30' data-id='MK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they immediately told Jesus about her. </span>
<span class='v MK1_31' data-id='MK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So he went to her, took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her and she began to wait on them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_32' data-id='MK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>That evening after sunset the people brought to Jesus all the sick and demon-possessed. </span>
<span class='v MK1_33' data-id='MK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The whole town gathered at the door, </span>
<span class='v MK1_34' data-id='MK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_35' data-id='MK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. </span>
<span class='v MK1_36' data-id='MK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Simon and his companions went to look for him, </span>
<span class='v MK1_37' data-id='MK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_38' data-id='MK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK1_39' data-id='MK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So he traveled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_40' data-id='MK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>A man with leprosy<span class='note' id='footnote-2556'><a href='#note-2556' class='key'>§</a></span> came to him and begged him on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_41' data-id='MK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus was indignant.<span class='note' id='footnote-2557'><a href='#note-2557' class='key'>*</a></span> He reached out his hand and touched the man. <span class='wj'>“I am willing,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“Be clean!”</span></span>
<span class='v MK1_42' data-id='MK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Immediately the leprosy left him and he was cleansed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_43' data-id='MK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning: </span>
<span class='v MK1_44' data-id='MK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“See that you don’t tell this to anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK1_45' data-id='MK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Instead he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere. </span></div></div>
