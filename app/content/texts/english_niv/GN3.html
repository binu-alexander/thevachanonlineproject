<div class='s'>The Fall </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_1' data-id='GN3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden’?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_2' data-id='GN3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, </span>
<span class='v GN3_3' data-id='GN3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_4' data-id='GN3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“You will not certainly die,” the serpent said to the woman. </span>
<span class='v GN3_5' data-id='GN3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_6' data-id='GN3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. </span>
<span class='v GN3_7' data-id='GN3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_8' data-id='GN3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and they hid from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God among the trees of the garden. </span>
<span class='v GN3_9' data-id='GN3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God called to the man, “Where are you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_10' data-id='GN3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He answered, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_11' data-id='GN3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_12' data-id='GN3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_13' data-id='GN3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_13' data-id='GN3_13'>The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To the woman he said, </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>To Adam he said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You must not eat from it,’ </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_21' data-id='GN3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them. </span>
