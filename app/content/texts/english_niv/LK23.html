<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_1' data-id='LK23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the whole assembly rose and led him off to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_2' data-id='LK23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and claims to be Messiah, a king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_3' data-id='LK23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_3' data-id='LK23_3'><span class='wj'>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_4' data-id='LK23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_5' data-id='LK23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But they insisted, “He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the way here.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_6' data-id='LK23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On hearing this, Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean. </span>
<span class='v LK23_7' data-id='LK23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When he learned that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_8' data-id='LK23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased, because for a long time he had been wanting to see him. From what he had heard about him, he hoped to see him perform a sign of some sort. </span>
<span class='v LK23_9' data-id='LK23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He plied him with many questions, but Jesus gave him no answer. </span>
<span class='v LK23_10' data-id='LK23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there, vehemently accusing him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_11' data-id='LK23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_12' data-id='LK23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>That day Herod and Pilate became friends—before this they had been enemies. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_13' data-id='LK23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers and the people, </span>
<span class='v LK23_14' data-id='LK23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_15' data-id='LK23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. </span>
<span class='v LK23_16' data-id='LK23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Therefore, I will punish him and then release him.<span class='note' id='footnote-2692'><a href='#note-2692' class='key'>*</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_18' data-id='LK23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But the whole crowd shouted, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_19' data-id='LK23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_20' data-id='LK23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate appealed to them again. </span>
<span class='v LK23_21' data-id='LK23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But they kept shouting, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_22' data-id='LK23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I have found in him no grounds for the death penalty. Therefore I will have him punished and then release him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_23' data-id='LK23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified, and their shouts prevailed. </span>
<span class='v LK23_24' data-id='LK23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Pilate decided to grant their demand. </span>
<span class='v LK23_25' data-id='LK23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and surrendered Jesus to their will. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_26' data-id='LK23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>As the soldiers led him away, they seized Simon from Cyrene, who was on his way in from the country, and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK23_27' data-id='LK23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A large number of people followed him, including women who mourned and wailed for him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_28' data-id='LK23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Jesus turned and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.</span></span>
<span class='v LK23_29' data-id='LK23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the childless women, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</span></span>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK23_31' data-id='LK23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For if people do these things when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_32' data-id='LK23_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Two other men, both criminals, were also led out with him to be executed. </span>
<span class='v LK23_33' data-id='LK23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When they came to the place called the Skull, they crucified him there, along with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left. </span>
<span class='v LK23_34' data-id='LK23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2694'><a href='#note-2694' class='key'>‡</a></span> And they divided up his clothes by casting lots. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_35' data-id='LK23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The people stood watching, and the rulers even sneered at him. They said, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_36' data-id='LK23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The soldiers also came up and mocked him. They offered him wine vinegar </span>
<span class='v LK23_37' data-id='LK23_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_38' data-id='LK23_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>There was a written notice above him, which read: <span class='sc'>this is the king of the jews</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_39' data-id='LK23_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>One of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_40' data-id='LK23_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But the other criminal rebuked him. “Don’t you fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence? </span>
<span class='v LK23_41' data-id='LK23_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_42' data-id='LK23_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.<span class='note' id='footnote-2695'><a href='#note-2695' class='key'>§</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_43' data-id='LK23_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_44' data-id='LK23_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, </span>
<span class='v LK23_45' data-id='LK23_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>for the sun stopped shining. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. </span>
<span class='v LK23_46' data-id='LK23_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Jesus called out with a loud voice, <span class='wj'>“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2696'><a href='#note-2696' class='key'>*</a></span> When he had said this, he breathed his last. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_47' data-id='LK23_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The centurion, seeing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_48' data-id='LK23_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away. </span>
<span class='v LK23_49' data-id='LK23_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Burial of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_50' data-id='LK23_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and upright man, </span>
<span class='v LK23_51' data-id='LK23_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>who had not consented to their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea, and he himself was waiting for the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v LK23_52' data-id='LK23_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body. </span>
<span class='v LK23_53' data-id='LK23_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock, one in which no one had yet been laid. </span>
<span class='v LK23_54' data-id='LK23_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_55' data-id='LK23_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. </span>
<span class='v LK23_56' data-id='LK23_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment. </span></div></div>
