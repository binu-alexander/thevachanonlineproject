<div class='s'>Micah’s Idols </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_1' data-id='JG17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim </span>
<span class='v JG17_2' data-id='JG17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-645'><a href='#note-645' class='key'>*</a></span> of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse—I have that silver with me; I took it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_2' data-id='JG17_2'>Then his mother said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless you, my son!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_3' data-id='JG17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said, “I solemnly consecrate my silver to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_4' data-id='JG17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-646'><a href='#note-646' class='key'>†</a></span> of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who used them to make the idol. And it was put in Micah’s house. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_5' data-id='JG17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods and installed one of his sons as his priest. </span>
<span class='v JG17_6' data-id='JG17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_7' data-id='JG17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah, </span>
<span class='v JG17_8' data-id='JG17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>left that town in search of some other place to stay. On his way<span class='note' id='footnote-647'><a href='#note-647' class='key'>‡</a></span> he came to Micah’s house in the hill country of Ephraim. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_9' data-id='JG17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Micah asked him, “Where are you from?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_9' data-id='JG17_9'>“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_10' data-id='JG17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-648'><a href='#note-648' class='key'>§</a></span> of silver a year, your clothes and your food.” </span>
<span class='v JG17_11' data-id='JG17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him. </span>
<span class='v JG17_12' data-id='JG17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house. </span>
<span class='v JG17_13' data-id='JG17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Micah said, “Now I know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will be good to me, since this Levite has become my priest.” </span></div></div>
