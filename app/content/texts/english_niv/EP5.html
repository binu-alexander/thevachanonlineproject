<span class='v EP5_1' data-id='EP5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Follow God’s example, therefore, as dearly loved children </span>
<span class='v EP5_2' data-id='EP5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_3' data-id='EP5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. </span>
<span class='v EP5_4' data-id='EP5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving. </span>
<span class='v EP5_5' data-id='EP5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.<span class='note' id='footnote-3077'><a href='#note-3077' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v EP5_6' data-id='EP5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. </span>
<span class='v EP5_7' data-id='EP5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not be partners with them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_8' data-id='EP5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light </span>
<span class='v EP5_9' data-id='EP5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth) </span>
<span class='v EP5_10' data-id='EP5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and find out what pleases the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP5_11' data-id='EP5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. </span>
<span class='v EP5_12' data-id='EP5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret. </span>
<span class='v EP5_13' data-id='EP5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But everything exposed by the light becomes visible—and everything that is illuminated becomes a light. </span>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This is why it is said: </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'>rise from the dead, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'>and Christ will shine on you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_15' data-id='EP5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, </span>
<span class='v EP5_16' data-id='EP5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil. </span>
<span class='v EP5_17' data-id='EP5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is. </span>
<span class='v EP5_18' data-id='EP5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit, </span>
<span class='v EP5_19' data-id='EP5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, </span>
<span class='v EP5_20' data-id='EP5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Instructions for Christian Households </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_21' data-id='EP5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_22' data-id='EP5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP5_23' data-id='EP5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. </span>
<span class='v EP5_24' data-id='EP5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_25' data-id='EP5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her </span>
<span class='v EP5_26' data-id='EP5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>to make her holy, cleansing<span class='note' id='footnote-3078'><a href='#note-3078' class='key'>†</a></span> her by the washing with water through the word, </span>
<span class='v EP5_27' data-id='EP5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless. </span>
<span class='v EP5_28' data-id='EP5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. </span>
<span class='v EP5_29' data-id='EP5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— </span>
<span class='v EP5_30' data-id='EP5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>for we are members of his body. </span>
<span class='v EP5_31' data-id='EP5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3079'><a href='#note-3079' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v EP5_32' data-id='EP5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. </span>
<span class='v EP5_33' data-id='EP5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. </span></div></div>
