<div class='s'>The Parable of the Wedding Banquet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_1' data-id='MT22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: </span>
<span class='v MT22_2' data-id='MT22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_3' data-id='MT22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come, but they refused to come.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_4' data-id='MT22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Then he sent some more servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner: My oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_5' data-id='MT22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But they paid no attention and went off—one to his field, another to his business.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_6' data-id='MT22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The rest seized his servants, mistreated them and killed them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_7' data-id='MT22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_8' data-id='MT22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited did not deserve to come.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_9' data-id='MT22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find.’ </span></span>
<span class='v MT22_10' data-id='MT22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find, the bad as well as the good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_11' data-id='MT22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But when the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_12' data-id='MT22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He asked, ‘How did you get in here without wedding clothes, friend?’ The man was speechless.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_13' data-id='MT22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Then the king told the attendants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_14' data-id='MT22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_15' data-id='MT22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words. </span>
<span class='v MT22_16' data-id='MT22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are. </span>
<span class='v MT22_17' data-id='MT22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay the imperial tax<span class='note' id='footnote-2523'><a href='#note-2523' class='key'>*</a></span> to Caesar or not?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_18' data-id='MT22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, knowing their evil intent, said, <span class='wj'>“You hypocrites, why are you trying to trap me?</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_19' data-id='MT22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Show me the coin used for paying the tax.”</span> They brought him a denarius, </span>
<span class='v MT22_20' data-id='MT22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_21' data-id='MT22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Caesar’s,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_21' data-id='MT22_21'>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“So give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_22' data-id='MT22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Marriage at the Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_23' data-id='MT22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. </span>
<span class='v MT22_24' data-id='MT22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him. </span>
<span class='v MT22_25' data-id='MT22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. </span>
<span class='v MT22_26' data-id='MT22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. </span>
<span class='v MT22_27' data-id='MT22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Finally, the woman died. </span>
<span class='v MT22_28' data-id='MT22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_29' data-id='MT22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_30' data-id='MT22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_31' data-id='MT22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But about the resurrection of the dead—have you not read what God said to you, </span></span>
<span class='v MT22_32' data-id='MT22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2524'><a href='#note-2524' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_33' data-id='MT22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Greatest Commandment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_34' data-id='MT22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. </span>
<span class='v MT22_35' data-id='MT22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: </span>
<span class='v MT22_36' data-id='MT22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_37' data-id='MT22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied: <span class='wj'>“ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2525'><a href='#note-2525' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v MT22_38' data-id='MT22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is the first and greatest commandment.</span></span>
<span class='v MT22_39' data-id='MT22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2526'><a href='#note-2526' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v MT22_40' data-id='MT22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Whose Son Is the Messiah? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_41' data-id='MT22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, </span>
<span class='v MT22_42' data-id='MT22_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_42' data-id='MT22_42'>“The son of David,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_43' data-id='MT22_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“How is it then that David, speaking by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says, </span></span></div>
