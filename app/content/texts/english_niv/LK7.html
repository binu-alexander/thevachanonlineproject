<div class='s'>The Faith of the Centurion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_1' data-id='LK7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum. </span>
<span class='v LK7_2' data-id='LK7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There a centurion’s servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die. </span>
<span class='v LK7_3' data-id='LK7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. </span>
<span class='v LK7_4' data-id='LK7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This man deserves to have you do this, </span>
<span class='v LK7_5' data-id='LK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.” </span>
<span class='v LK7_6' data-id='LK7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_6' data-id='LK7_6'>He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him: “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. </span>
<span class='v LK7_7' data-id='LK7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class='v LK7_8' data-id='LK7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_9' data-id='LK7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_10' data-id='LK7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Raises a Widow’s Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_11' data-id='LK7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him. </span>
<span class='v LK7_12' data-id='LK7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her. </span>
<span class='v LK7_13' data-id='LK7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When the Lord saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, <span class='wj'>“Don’t cry.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_14' data-id='LK7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he went up and touched the bier they were carrying him on, and the bearers stood still. He said, <span class='wj'>“Young man, I say to you, get up!”</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_15' data-id='LK7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to his mother. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_16' data-id='LK7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They were all filled with awe and praised God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.” </span>
<span class='v LK7_17' data-id='LK7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding country. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus and John the Baptist </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_18' data-id='LK7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>John’s disciples told him about all these things. Calling two of them, </span>
<span class='v LK7_19' data-id='LK7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_20' data-id='LK7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_21' data-id='LK7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that very time Jesus cured many who had diseases, sicknesses and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind. </span>
<span class='v LK7_22' data-id='LK7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So he replied to the messengers, <span class='wj'>“Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2646'><a href='#note-2646' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_23' data-id='LK7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_24' data-id='LK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After John’s messengers left, Jesus began to speak to the crowd about John: <span class='wj'>“What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_25' data-id='LK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_26' data-id='LK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_27' data-id='LK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is the one about whom it is written: </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK7_27' data-id='LK7_27'><span class='wj'>“ ‘I will send my messenger ahead of you, </span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_28' data-id='LK7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_29' data-id='LK7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>(All the people, even the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged that God’s way was right, because they had been baptized by John. </span>
<span class='v LK7_30' data-id='LK7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, because they had not been baptized by John.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_31' data-id='LK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus went on to say, <span class='wj'>“To what, then, can I compare the people of this generation? What are they like?</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other: </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='wj'>“ ‘We played the pipe for you, </span></span></div>

<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='wj'>and you did not dance; </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='wj'>we sang a dirge, </span></span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK7_32' data-id='LK7_32'><span class='wj'>and you did not cry.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK7_33' data-id='LK7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK7_34' data-id='LK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK7_35' data-id='LK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But wisdom is proved right by all her children.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Anointed by a Sinful Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_36' data-id='LK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. </span>
<span class='v LK7_37' data-id='LK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>A woman in that town who lived a sinful life learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she came there with an alabaster jar of perfume. </span>
<span class='v LK7_38' data-id='LK7_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>As she stood behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them and poured perfume on them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_39' data-id='LK7_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_40' data-id='LK7_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, <span class='wj'>“Simon, I have something to tell you.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_40' data-id='LK7_40'>“Tell me, teacher,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_41' data-id='LK7_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Two people owed money to a certain moneylender.

<span class='v LK7_42' data-id='LK7_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_43' data-id='LK7_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_43' data-id='LK7_43'><span class='wj'>“You have judged correctly,”</span> Jesus said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_44' data-id='LK7_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, <span class='wj'>“Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_45' data-id='LK7_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_46' data-id='LK7_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.</span></span>
<span class='v LK7_47' data-id='LK7_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_48' data-id='LK7_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to her, <span class='wj'>“Your sins are forgiven.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK7_49' data-id='LK7_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The other guests began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” </span></div>
