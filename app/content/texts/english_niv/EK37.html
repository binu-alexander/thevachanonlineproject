<div class='s'>The Valley of Dry Bones </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_1' data-id='EK37_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The hand of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and set me in the middle of a valley; it was full of bones. </span>
<span class='v EK37_2' data-id='EK37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He led me back and forth among them, and I saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley, bones that were very dry. </span>
<span class='v EK37_3' data-id='EK37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_3' data-id='EK37_3'>I said, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, you alone know.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_4' data-id='EK37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to these bones and say to them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>! </span>
<span class='v EK37_5' data-id='EK37_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says to these bones: I will make breath<span class='note' id='footnote-2110'><a href='#note-2110' class='key'>*</a></span> enter you, and you will come to life. </span>
<span class='v EK37_6' data-id='EK37_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin; I will put breath in you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_7' data-id='EK37_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I was prophesying, there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone. </span>
<span class='v EK37_8' data-id='EK37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them, but there was no breath in them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_9' data-id='EK37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Come, breath, from the four winds and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’ ” </span>
<span class='v EK37_10' data-id='EK37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet—a vast army. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_11' data-id='EK37_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me: “Son of man, these bones are the people of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up and our hope is gone; we are cut off.’ </span>
<span class='v EK37_12' data-id='EK37_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will bring you back to the land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK37_13' data-id='EK37_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then you, my people, will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, when I open your graves and bring you up from them. </span>
<span class='v EK37_14' data-id='EK37_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will put my Spirit in you and you will live, and I will settle you in your own land.

<span class='v EK37_15' data-id='EK37_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>

<span class='v EK37_17' data-id='EK37_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand. </span></div>

<span class='v EK37_22' data-id='EK37_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. There will be one king over all of them and they will never again be two nations or be divided into two kingdoms. </span>
<span class='v EK37_23' data-id='EK37_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They will no longer defile themselves with their idols and vile images or with any of their offenses, for I will save them from all their sinful backsliding,<span class='note' id='footnote-2111'><a href='#note-2111' class='key'>†</a></span> and I will cleanse them.
