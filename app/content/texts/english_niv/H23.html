<span class='v H23_7' data-id='H23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, </span>
<span class='v H23_8' data-id='H23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. </span>
<span class='v H23_9' data-id='H23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. </span>
<span class='v H23_10' data-id='H23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.” </span></div>

<span class='v H23_15' data-id='H23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer. </span></div>
