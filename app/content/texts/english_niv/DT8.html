<div class='s'>Do Not Forget the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT8_1' data-id='DT8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Be careful to follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> promised on oath to your ancestors. </span>
<span class='v DT8_2' data-id='DT8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Remember how the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God led you all the way in the wilderness these forty years, to humble and test you in order to know what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. </span>
<span class='v DT8_3' data-id='DT8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He humbled you, causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had known, to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v DT8_4' data-id='DT8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years. </span>
<span class='v DT8_5' data-id='DT8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son, so the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God disciplines you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT8_6' data-id='DT8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Observe the commands of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, walking in obedience to him and revering him. </span>
<span class='v DT8_7' data-id='DT8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is bringing you into a good land—a land with brooks, streams, and deep springs gushing out into the valleys and hills; </span>
<span class='v DT8_8' data-id='DT8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>a land with wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil and honey; </span>
<span class='v DT8_9' data-id='DT8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing; a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT8_10' data-id='DT8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When you have eaten and are satisfied, praise the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God for the good land he has given you. </span>
<span class='v DT8_11' data-id='DT8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Be careful that you do not forget the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, failing to observe his commands, his laws and his decrees that I am giving you this day. </span>
<span class='v DT8_12' data-id='DT8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you build fine houses and settle down, </span>
<span class='v DT8_13' data-id='DT8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied, </span>
<span class='v DT8_14' data-id='DT8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>then your heart will become proud and you will forget the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. </span>
<span class='v DT8_15' data-id='DT8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He led you through the vast and dreadful wilderness, that thirsty and waterless land, with its venomous snakes and scorpions. He brought you water out of hard rock. </span>
<span class='v DT8_16' data-id='DT8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He gave you manna to eat in the wilderness, something your ancestors had never known, to humble and test you so that in the end it might go well with you. </span>
<span class='v DT8_17' data-id='DT8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” </span>
<span class='v DT8_18' data-id='DT8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But remember the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT8_19' data-id='DT8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If you ever forget the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them, I testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed. </span>
<span class='v DT8_20' data-id='DT8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Like the nations the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> destroyed before you, so you will be destroyed for not obeying the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span></div></div>
