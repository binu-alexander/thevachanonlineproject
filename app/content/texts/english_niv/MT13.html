<span class='v MT13_1' data-id='MT13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. </span>
<span class='v MT13_2' data-id='MT13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people stood on the shore. </span>
<span class='v MT13_3' data-id='MT13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then he told them many things in parables, saying: <span class='wj'>“A farmer went out to sow his seed.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_4' data-id='MT13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_5' data-id='MT13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_6' data-id='MT13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_7' data-id='MT13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_8' data-id='MT13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_9' data-id='MT13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever has ears, let them hear.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_10' data-id='MT13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_11' data-id='MT13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_12' data-id='MT13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_13' data-id='MT13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is why I speak to them in parables: </span></span></div>

<span class='v MT13_17' data-id='MT13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_18' data-id='MT13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Listen then to what the parable of the sower means:</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_19' data-id='MT13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_20' data-id='MT13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_21' data-id='MT13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_22' data-id='MT13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_23' data-id='MT13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the seed falling on good soil refers to someone who hears the word and understands it.

<div class='s'>The Parable of the Weeds </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_24' data-id='MT13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus told them another parable: <span class='wj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_25' data-id='MT13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_26' data-id='MT13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_27' data-id='MT13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The owner’s servants came to him and said, ‘Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_28' data-id='MT13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘An enemy did this,’ he replied. </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_28' data-id='MT13_28'><span class='wj'>“The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and pull them up?’</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_29' data-id='MT13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘No,’ he answered, ‘because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_30' data-id='MT13_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.’ ”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_31' data-id='MT13_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He told them another parable: <span class='wj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_32' data-id='MT13_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_33' data-id='MT13_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He told them still another parable: <span class='wj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2486'><a href='#note-2486' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_34' data-id='MT13_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables; he did not say anything to them without using a parable. </span>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'>“I will open my mouth in parables, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'>I will utter things hidden since the creation of the world.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2487'><a href='#note-2487' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Weeds Explained </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_36' data-id='MT13_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then he left the crowd and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_37' data-id='MT13_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class='wj'>“The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_38' data-id='MT13_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The field is the world, and the good seed stands for the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, </span></span>
<span class='v MT13_39' data-id='MT13_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_40' data-id='MT13_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“As the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_41' data-id='MT13_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_42' data-id='MT13_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span></span>
<span class='v MT13_43' data-id='MT13_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears, let them hear.</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parables of the Hidden Treasure and the Pearl </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_44' data-id='MT13_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_45' data-id='MT13_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls.</span></span>

<div class='s'>The Parable of the Net </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_47' data-id='MT13_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Once again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish.</span></span>

<span class='v MT13_49' data-id='MT13_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</span></span>

<span class='v MT13_51' data-id='MT13_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Have you understood all these things?”</span> Jesus asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_52' data-id='MT13_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Therefore every teacher of the law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”</span></span></div>

<span class='v MT13_53' data-id='MT13_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there. </span>
<span class='v MT13_54' data-id='MT13_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were amazed. “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?” they asked. </span>
<span class='v MT13_55' data-id='MT13_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>“Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother’s name Mary, and aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas? </span>
