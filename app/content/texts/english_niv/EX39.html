<div class='s'>The Priestly Garments </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_1' data-id='EX39_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary. They also made sacred garments for Aaron, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ephod </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_2' data-id='EX39_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They<span class='note' id='footnote-346'><a href='#note-346' class='key'>*</a></span> made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. </span>
<span class='v EX39_3' data-id='EX39_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut strands to be worked into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen—the work of skilled hands. </span>
<span class='v EX39_4' data-id='EX39_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached to two of its corners, so it could be fastened. </span>
<span class='v EX39_5' data-id='EX39_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Its skillfully woven waistband was like it—of one piece with the ephod and made with gold, and with blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and with finely twisted linen, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_6' data-id='EX39_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree settings and engraved them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX39_7' data-id='EX39_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then they fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Breastpiece </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_8' data-id='EX39_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They fashioned the breastpiece—the work of a skilled craftsman. They made it like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen. </span>
<span class='v EX39_9' data-id='EX39_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>It was square—a span<span class='note' id='footnote-347'><a href='#note-347' class='key'>†</a></span> long and a span wide—and folded double. </span>
<span class='v EX39_10' data-id='EX39_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then they mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl; </span>
<span class='v EX39_11' data-id='EX39_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald; </span>
<span class='v EX39_12' data-id='EX39_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst; </span>
<span class='v EX39_13' data-id='EX39_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper.<span class='note' id='footnote-348'><a href='#note-348' class='key'>‡</a></span> They were mounted in gold filigree settings. </span>
<span class='v EX39_14' data-id='EX39_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_15' data-id='EX39_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope. </span>
<span class='v EX39_16' data-id='EX39_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to two of the corners of the breastpiece. </span>
<span class='v EX39_17' data-id='EX39_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They fastened the two gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece, </span>
<span class='v EX39_18' data-id='EX39_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and the other ends of the chains to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front. </span>
<span class='v EX39_19' data-id='EX39_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge next to the ephod. </span>
<span class='v EX39_20' data-id='EX39_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the seam just above the waistband of the ephod. </span>
<span class='v EX39_21' data-id='EX39_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, connecting it to the waistband so that the breastpiece would not swing out from the ephod—as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Other Priestly Garments </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_22' data-id='EX39_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver— </span>
<span class='v EX39_23' data-id='EX39_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>with an opening in the center of the robe like the opening of a collar,<span class='note' id='footnote-349'><a href='#note-349' class='key'>§</a></span> and a band around this opening, so that it would not tear. </span>
<span class='v EX39_24' data-id='EX39_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe. </span>
<span class='v EX39_25' data-id='EX39_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And they made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates. </span>
<span class='v EX39_26' data-id='EX39_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe to be worn for ministering, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_27' data-id='EX39_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver— </span>
<span class='v EX39_28' data-id='EX39_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and the turban of fine linen, the linen caps and the undergarments of finely twisted linen. </span>
<span class='v EX39_29' data-id='EX39_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The sash was made of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn—the work of an embroiderer—as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_30' data-id='EX39_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: <span class='sc'>holy to the Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v EX39_31' data-id='EX39_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then they fastened a blue cord to it to attach it to the turban, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_32' data-id='EX39_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses. </span>
<span class='v EX39_33' data-id='EX39_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then they brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts and bases; </span>

<span class='v EX39_38' data-id='EX39_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; </span>
<span class='v EX39_39' data-id='EX39_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand; </span>
<span class='v EX39_40' data-id='EX39_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the furnishings for the tabernacle, the tent of meeting; </span>
<span class='v EX39_41' data-id='EX39_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>and the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX39_42' data-id='EX39_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>The Israelites had done all the work just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span>
