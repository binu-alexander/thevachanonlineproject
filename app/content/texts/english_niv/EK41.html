<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK41_3' data-id='EK41_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then he went into the inner sanctuary and measured the jambs of the entrance; each was two cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-2151'><a href='#note-2151' class='key'>†</a></span> wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls on each side of it were seven cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-2152'><a href='#note-2152' class='key'>‡</a></span> wide. </span>
<span class='v EK41_4' data-id='EK41_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he measured the length of the inner sanctuary; it was twenty cubits, and its width was twenty cubits across the end of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.” </span></div>

<span class='v EK41_5' data-id='EK41_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was six cubits thick, and each side room around the temple was four cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-2153'><a href='#note-2153' class='key'>§</a></span> wide. </span>
<span class='v EK41_6' data-id='EK41_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The side rooms were on three levels, one above another, thirty on each level.

<span class='v EK41_7' data-id='EK41_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The side rooms all around the temple were wider at each successive level.

<span class='v EK41_17' data-id='EK41_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In the space above the outside of the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls at regular intervals all around the inner and outer sanctuary </span>
<span class='v EK41_18' data-id='EK41_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>were carved cherubim and palm trees. Palm trees alternated with cherubim. Each cherub had two faces: </span>
<span class='v EK41_19' data-id='EK41_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>the face of a human being toward the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other. They were carved all around the whole temple. </span>
<span class='v EK41_20' data-id='EK41_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>From the floor to the area above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the wall of the main hall. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK41_21' data-id='EK41_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The main hall had a rectangular doorframe, and the one at the front of the Most Holy Place was similar. </span>
<span class='v EK41_22' data-id='EK41_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>There was a wooden altar three cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-2157'><a href='#note-2157' class='key'>§</a></span> high and two cubits square<span class='note' id='footnote-2158'><a href='#note-2158' class='key'>*</a></span>; its corners, its base<span class='note' id='footnote-2159'><a href='#note-2159' class='key'>†</a></span> and its sides were of wood.
