<span class='v RV1_9' data-id='RV1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I, John, your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v RV1_10' data-id='RV1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On the Lord’s Day I was in the Spirit, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet, </span>
<span class='v RV1_11' data-id='RV1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>which said: <span class='wj'>“Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.”</span></span></div>
