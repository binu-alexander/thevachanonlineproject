<span class='v R21_1' data-id='R21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Solomon son of David established himself firmly over his kingdom, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> his God was with him and made him exceedingly great. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R21_2' data-id='R21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon spoke to all Israel—to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, to the judges and to all the leaders in Israel, the heads of families— </span>
<span class='v R21_3' data-id='R21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and Solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at Gibeon, for God’s tent of meeting was there, which Moses the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s servant had made in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v R21_4' data-id='R21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to the place he had prepared for it, because he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R21_5' data-id='R21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; so Solomon and the assembly inquired of him there. </span>
<span class='v R21_6' data-id='R21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Solomon went up to the bronze altar before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R21_7' data-id='R21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R21_8' data-id='R21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Solomon answered God, “You have shown great kindness to David my father and have made me king in his place. </span>
<span class='v R21_9' data-id='R21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now, <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God, let your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth. </span>
<span class='v R21_10' data-id='R21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may lead this people, for who is able to govern this great people of yours?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R21_11' data-id='R21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>God said to Solomon, “Since this is your heart’s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king, </span>
<span class='v R21_12' data-id='R21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R21_13' data-id='R21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon went to Jerusalem from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting. And he reigned over Israel. </span></div>

<span class='v R21_14' data-id='R21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Solomon accumulated chariots and horses; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses,<span class='note' id='footnote-1124'><a href='#note-1124' class='key'>*</a></span> which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R21_15' data-id='R21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as plentiful as sycamore-fig trees in the foothills. </span>
<span class='v R21_16' data-id='R21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue<span class='note' id='footnote-1125'><a href='#note-1125' class='key'>†</a></span>—the royal merchants purchased them from Kue at the current price. </span>
<span class='v R21_17' data-id='R21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-1126'><a href='#note-1126' class='key'>‡</a></span> of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty.<span class='note' id='footnote-1127'><a href='#note-1127' class='key'>§</a></span> They also exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and of the Arameans. </span></div></div>
