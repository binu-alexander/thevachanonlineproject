<div class='s'>Saul Takes His Life </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_1' data-id='R110_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; the Israelites fled before them, and many fell dead on Mount Gilboa. </span>
<span class='v R110_2' data-id='R110_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Philistines were in hot pursuit of Saul and his sons, and they killed his sons Jonathan, Abinadab and Malki-Shua. </span>
<span class='v R110_3' data-id='R110_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The fighting grew fierce around Saul, and when the archers overtook him, they wounded him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_4' data-id='R110_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through, or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_4' data-id='R110_4'>But his armor-bearer was terrified and would not do it; so Saul took his own sword and fell on it. </span>
<span class='v R110_5' data-id='R110_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When the armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his sword and died. </span>
<span class='v R110_6' data-id='R110_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Saul and his three sons died, and all his house died together. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_7' data-id='R110_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their towns and fled. And the Philistines came and occupied them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_8' data-id='R110_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. </span>
<span class='v R110_9' data-id='R110_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They stripped him and took his head and his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people. </span>
<span class='v R110_10' data-id='R110_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of Dagon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_11' data-id='R110_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When all the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, </span>
<span class='v R110_12' data-id='R110_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>all their valiant men went and took the bodies of Saul and his sons and brought them to Jabesh. Then they buried their bones under the great tree in Jabesh, and they fasted seven days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R110_13' data-id='R110_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Saul died because he was unfaithful to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; he did not keep the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and even consulted a medium for guidance, </span>
<span class='v R110_14' data-id='R110_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and did not inquire of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse. </span></div></div>
