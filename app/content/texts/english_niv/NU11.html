<div class='s'>Fire From the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_1' data-id='NU11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and when he heard them his anger was aroused. Then fire from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU11_2' data-id='NU11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the fire died down. </span>
<span class='v NU11_3' data-id='NU11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So that place was called Taberah,<span class='note' id='footnote-441'><a href='#note-441' class='key'>*</a></span> because fire from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had burned among them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Quail From the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_4' data-id='NU11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The rabble with them began to crave other food, and again the Israelites started wailing and said, “If only we had meat to eat! </span>
<span class='v NU11_5' data-id='NU11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic. </span>
<span class='v NU11_6' data-id='NU11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_7' data-id='NU11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin. </span>
<span class='v NU11_8' data-id='NU11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The people went around gathering it, and then ground it in a hand mill or crushed it in a mortar. They cooked it in a pot or made it into loaves. And it tasted like something made with olive oil. </span>
<span class='v NU11_9' data-id='NU11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When the dew settled on the camp at night, the manna also came down. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_10' data-id='NU11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled. </span>
<span class='v NU11_11' data-id='NU11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He asked the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “Why have you brought this trouble on your servant? What have I done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me? </span>
<span class='v NU11_12' data-id='NU11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do you tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land you promised on oath to their ancestors? </span>
<span class='v NU11_13' data-id='NU11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ </span>
<span class='v NU11_14' data-id='NU11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy for me. </span>
<span class='v NU11_15' data-id='NU11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If this is how you are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favor in your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_16' data-id='NU11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses: “Bring me seventy of Israel’s elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people. Have them come to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you. </span>
<span class='v NU11_17' data-id='NU11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take some of the power of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will share the burden of the people with you so that you will not have to carry it alone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_18' data-id='NU11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, when you will eat meat. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> heard you when you wailed, “If only we had meat to eat! We were better off in Egypt!” Now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will give you meat, and you will eat it. </span>
<span class='v NU11_19' data-id='NU11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You will not eat it for just one day, or two days, or five, ten or twenty days, </span>
<span class='v NU11_20' data-id='NU11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who is among you, and have wailed before him, saying, “Why did we ever leave Egypt?” ’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_21' data-id='NU11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, ‘I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!’ </span>
<span class='v NU11_22' data-id='NU11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_23' data-id='NU11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered Moses, “Is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not what I say will come true for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_24' data-id='NU11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Moses went out and told the people what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said. He brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent. </span>
<span class='v NU11_25' data-id='NU11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came down in the cloud and spoke with him, and he took some of the power of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied—but did not do so again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_26' data-id='NU11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>However, two men, whose names were Eldad and Medad, had remained in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but did not go out to the tent. Yet the Spirit also rested on them, and they prophesied in the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU11_27' data-id='NU11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_28' data-id='NU11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ aide since youth, spoke up and said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_29' data-id='NU11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s people were prophets and that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> would put his Spirit on them!” </span>
<span class='v NU11_30' data-id='NU11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_31' data-id='NU11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Now a wind went out from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and drove quail in from the sea. It scattered them up to two cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-442'><a href='#note-442' class='key'>†</a></span> deep all around the camp, as far as a day’s walk in any direction. </span>
<span class='v NU11_32' data-id='NU11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>All that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail. No one gathered less than ten homers.<span class='note' id='footnote-443'><a href='#note-443' class='key'>‡</a></span> Then they spread them out all around the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU11_33' data-id='NU11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed, the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> burned against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague. </span>
<span class='v NU11_34' data-id='NU11_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Therefore the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah,<span class='note' id='footnote-444'><a href='#note-444' class='key'>§</a></span> because there they buried the people who had craved other food. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU11_35' data-id='NU11_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there. </span></div></div>
