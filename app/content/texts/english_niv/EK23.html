<div class='s'>Two Adulterous Sisters </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_1' data-id='EK23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK23_2' data-id='EK23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother. </span>
<span class='v EK23_3' data-id='EK23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. In that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed. </span>
<span class='v EK23_4' data-id='EK23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The older was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters. Oholah is Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_5' data-id='EK23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; and she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians—warriors </span>
<span class='v EK23_6' data-id='EK23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, and mounted horsemen. </span>
<span class='v EK23_7' data-id='EK23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>She gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the Assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after. </span>
<span class='v EK23_8' data-id='EK23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>She did not give up the prostitution she began in Egypt, when during her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust on her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_9' data-id='EK23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted. </span>
<span class='v EK23_10' data-id='EK23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and punishment was inflicted on her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_11' data-id='EK23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister. </span>
<span class='v EK23_12' data-id='EK23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, warriors in full dress, mounted horsemen, all handsome young men. </span>
<span class='v EK23_13' data-id='EK23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them went the same way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_14' data-id='EK23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“But she carried her prostitution still further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, figures of Chaldeans<span class='note' id='footnote-2084'><a href='#note-2084' class='key'>*</a></span> portrayed in red, </span>
<span class='v EK23_15' data-id='EK23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian chariot officers, natives of Chaldea.<span class='note' id='footnote-2085'><a href='#note-2085' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v EK23_16' data-id='EK23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>As soon as she saw them, she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea. </span>
<span class='v EK23_17' data-id='EK23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the Babylonians came to her, to the bed of love, and in their lust they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust. </span>
<span class='v EK23_18' data-id='EK23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her naked body, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister. </span>
<span class='v EK23_19' data-id='EK23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EK23_20' data-id='EK23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>There she lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses. </span>
<span class='v EK23_21' data-id='EK23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.<span class='note' id='footnote-2086'><a href='#note-2086' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_22' data-id='EK23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I will stir up your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side— </span>
<span class='v EK23_23' data-id='EK23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, handsome young men, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses. </span>
<span class='v EK23_24' data-id='EK23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>They will come against you with weapons,<span class='note' id='footnote-2087'><a href='#note-2087' class='key'>§</a></span> chariots and wagons and with a throng of people; they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will turn you over to them for punishment, and they will punish you according to their standards. </span>
<span class='v EK23_25' data-id='EK23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in fury. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those of you who are left will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire. </span>
<span class='v EK23_26' data-id='EK23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry. </span>
<span class='v EK23_27' data-id='EK23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_28' data-id='EK23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“For this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust. </span>
<span class='v EK23_29' data-id='EK23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for. They will leave you stark naked, and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed. Your lewdness and promiscuity </span>
<span class='v EK23_30' data-id='EK23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>have brought this on you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. </span>
<span class='v EK23_31' data-id='EK23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>You have gone the way of your sister; so I will put her cup into your hand. </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v EK23_33' data-id='EK23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EK23_33' data-id='EK23_33'>the cup of ruin and desolation, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EK23_33' data-id='EK23_33'>the cup of your sister Samaria. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EK23_34' data-id='EK23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>You will drink it and drain it dry </span></div>

<span class='v EK23_34' data-id='EK23_34'>and chew on its pieces— </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EK23_34' data-id='EK23_34'>and you will tear your breasts. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_34' data-id='EK23_34'>I have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v EK23_35' data-id='EK23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“Therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Since you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_36' data-id='EK23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices, </span>
<span class='v EK23_37' data-id='EK23_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They committed adultery with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them. </span>
<span class='v EK23_38' data-id='EK23_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>They have also done this to me: At that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths. </span>
<span class='v EK23_39' data-id='EK23_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_40' data-id='EK23_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>“They even sent messengers for men who came from far away, and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and put on your jewelry. </span>
<span class='v EK23_41' data-id='EK23_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>You sat on an elegant couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and olive oil that belonged to me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK23_42' data-id='EK23_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>“The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads. </span>
<span class='v EK23_43' data-id='EK23_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then I said about the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’ </span>
<span class='v EK23_44' data-id='EK23_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And they slept with her. As men sleep with a prostitute, so they slept with those lewd women, Oholah and Oholibah. </span>
<span class='v EK23_45' data-id='EK23_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands. </span></div>

<span class='v EK23_46' data-id='EK23_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder. </span>
