<span class='v DT26_1' data-id='DT26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When you have entered the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it, </span>
<span class='v DT26_2' data-id='DT26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you and put them in a basket. Then go to the place the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name </span>
<span class='v DT26_3' data-id='DT26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say to the priest in office at the time, “I declare today to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God that I have come to the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> swore to our ancestors to give us.” </span>
<span class='v DT26_4' data-id='DT26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span>
<span class='v DT26_5' data-id='DT26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then you shall declare before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God: “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he went down into Egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation, powerful and numerous. </span>
<span class='v DT26_6' data-id='DT26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But the Egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer, subjecting us to harsh labor. </span>
<span class='v DT26_7' data-id='DT26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then we cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> heard our voice and saw our misery, toil and oppression. </span>
<span class='v DT26_8' data-id='DT26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. </span>
<span class='v DT26_9' data-id='DT26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey; </span>
<span class='v DT26_10' data-id='DT26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and now I bring the firstfruits of the soil that you, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, have given me.” Place the basket before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and bow down before him. </span>
<span class='v DT26_11' data-id='DT26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then you and the Levites and the foreigners residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has given to you and your household. </span></div>

<span class='v DT26_13' data-id='DT26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then say to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God: “I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless and the widow, according to all you commanded.

<span class='v DT26_14' data-id='DT26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I have not eaten any of the sacred portion while I was in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while I was unclean, nor have I offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God; I have done everything you commanded me. </span>
<span class='v DT26_15' data-id='DT26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Look down from heaven, your holy dwelling place, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.” </span></div>
