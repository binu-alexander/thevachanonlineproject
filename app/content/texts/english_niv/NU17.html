<div class='s'>The Budding of Aaron’s Staff </div>

<span class='v NU17_1' data-id='NU17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU17_2' data-id='NU17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Speak to the Israelites and get twelve staffs from them, one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes. Write the name of each man on his staff. </span>
<span class='v NU17_3' data-id='NU17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On the staff of Levi write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe. </span>
<span class='v NU17_4' data-id='NU17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant law, where I meet with you. </span>
<span class='v NU17_5' data-id='NU17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the Israelites.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU17_6' data-id='NU17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes, and Aaron’s staff was among them. </span>
<span class='v NU17_7' data-id='NU17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Moses placed the staffs before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the tent of the covenant law. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU17_8' data-id='NU17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, which represented the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed and produced almonds. </span>
<span class='v NU17_9' data-id='NU17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Moses brought out all the staffs from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s presence to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each of the leaders took his own staff. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU17_10' data-id='NU17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Put back Aaron’s staff in front of the ark of the covenant law, to be kept as a sign to the rebellious. This will put an end to their grumbling against me, so that they will not die.” </span>
<span class='v NU17_11' data-id='NU17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Moses did just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded him. </span></div>
