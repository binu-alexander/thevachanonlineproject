<span class='v DT10_1' data-id='DT10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark.<span class='note' id='footnote-520'><a href='#note-520' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v DT10_2' data-id='DT10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you are to put them in the ark.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT10_3' data-id='DT10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. </span>
<span class='v DT10_4' data-id='DT10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> wrote on these tablets what he had written before, the Ten Commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain, out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave them to me. </span>
<span class='v DT10_5' data-id='DT10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded me, and they are there now. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT10_6' data-id='DT10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>(The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him as priest. </span>
<span class='v DT10_7' data-id='DT10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>From there they traveled to Gudgodah and on to Jotbathah, a land with streams of water. </span>
<span class='v DT10_8' data-id='DT10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>At that time the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, to stand before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name, as they still do today. </span>
<span class='v DT10_9' data-id='DT10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is their inheritance, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God told them.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT10_10' data-id='DT10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now I had stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> listened to me at this time also. It was not his will to destroy you. </span>
<span class='v DT10_11' data-id='DT10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Go,” the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT10_12' data-id='DT10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And now, Israel, what does the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God ask of you but to fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God with all your heart and with all your soul, </span>
<span class='v DT10_13' data-id='DT10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and to observe the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good? </span></div>

<span class='v DT10_14' data-id='DT10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>To the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and everything in it. </span>
<span class='v DT10_15' data-id='DT10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today. </span>
<span class='v DT10_16' data-id='DT10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. </span>
<span class='v DT10_17' data-id='DT10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes. </span>
<span class='v DT10_18' data-id='DT10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. </span>
<span class='v DT10_19' data-id='DT10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And you are to love those who are foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. </span>
<span class='v DT10_20' data-id='DT10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name. </span>
<span class='v DT10_21' data-id='DT10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes. </span>
<span class='v DT10_22' data-id='DT10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your ancestors who went down into Egypt were seventy in all, and now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. </span></div></div>
