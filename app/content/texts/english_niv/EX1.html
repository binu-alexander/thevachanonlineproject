<span class='v EX1_1' data-id='EX1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: </span>
<span class='v EX1_2' data-id='EX1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; </span>
<span class='v EX1_3' data-id='EX1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; </span>
<span class='v EX1_4' data-id='EX1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. </span>
<span class='v EX1_5' data-id='EX1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy<span class='note' id='footnote-225'><a href='#note-225' class='key'>*</a></span> in all; Joseph was already in Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_6' data-id='EX1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died, </span>
<span class='v EX1_7' data-id='EX1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but the Israelites were exceedingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_8' data-id='EX1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EX1_9' data-id='EX1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. </span>
<span class='v EX1_10' data-id='EX1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_11' data-id='EX1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. </span>
<span class='v EX1_12' data-id='EX1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites </span>
<span class='v EX1_13' data-id='EX1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and worked them ruthlessly. </span>
<span class='v EX1_14' data-id='EX1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_15' data-id='EX1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, </span>
<span class='v EX1_16' data-id='EX1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” </span>
<span class='v EX1_17' data-id='EX1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. </span>
<span class='v EX1_18' data-id='EX1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_19' data-id='EX1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_20' data-id='EX1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. </span>
<span class='v EX1_21' data-id='EX1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX1_22' data-id='EX1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.” </span></div></div>
