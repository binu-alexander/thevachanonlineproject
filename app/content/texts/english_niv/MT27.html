<div class='s'>Judas Hangs Himself </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_1' data-id='MT27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people made their plans how to have Jesus executed. </span>
<span class='v MT27_2' data-id='MT27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So they bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_3' data-id='MT27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders. </span>
<span class='v MT27_4' data-id='MT27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“I have sinned,” he said, “for I have betrayed innocent blood.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_4' data-id='MT27_4'>“What is that to us?” they replied. “That’s your responsibility.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_5' data-id='MT27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_6' data-id='MT27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The chief priests picked up the coins and said, “It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_7' data-id='MT27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So they decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. </span>
<span class='v MT27_8' data-id='MT27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day. </span>
<span class='v MT27_9' data-id='MT27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him by the people of Israel, </span>
<span class='v MT27_10' data-id='MT27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2543'><a href='#note-2543' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Before Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_11' data-id='MT27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_11' data-id='MT27_11'><span class='wj'>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_12' data-id='MT27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer. </span>
<span class='v MT27_13' data-id='MT27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate asked him, “Don’t you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_14' data-id='MT27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge—to the great amazement of the governor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_15' data-id='MT27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now it was the governor’s custom at the festival to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd. </span>
<span class='v MT27_16' data-id='MT27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At that time they had a well-known prisoner whose name was Jesus<span class='note' id='footnote-2544'><a href='#note-2544' class='key'>†</a></span> Barabbas. </span>
<span class='v MT27_17' data-id='MT27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which one do you want me to release to you: Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_18' data-id='MT27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For he knew it was out of self-interest that they had handed Jesus over to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_19' data-id='MT27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>While Pilate was sitting on the judge’s seat, his wife sent him this message: “Don’t have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_20' data-id='MT27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_21' data-id='MT27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” asked the governor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_21' data-id='MT27_21'>“Barabbas,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_22' data-id='MT27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” Pilate asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_22' data-id='MT27_22'>They all answered, “Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_23' data-id='MT27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_23' data-id='MT27_23'>But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_24' data-id='MT27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I am innocent of this man’s blood,” he said. “It is your responsibility!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_25' data-id='MT27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>All the people answered, “His blood is on us and on our children!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_26' data-id='MT27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Soldiers Mock Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_27' data-id='MT27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then the governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_28' data-id='MT27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, </span>
<span class='v MT27_29' data-id='MT27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand. Then they knelt in front of him and mocked him. “Hail, king of the Jews!” they said. </span>
<span class='v MT27_30' data-id='MT27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again. </span>
<span class='v MT27_31' data-id='MT27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_32' data-id='MT27_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross. </span>
<span class='v MT27_33' data-id='MT27_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They came to a place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). </span>
<span class='v MT27_34' data-id='MT27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it. </span>
<span class='v MT27_35' data-id='MT27_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots. </span>
<span class='v MT27_36' data-id='MT27_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And sitting down, they kept watch over him there. </span>
<span class='v MT27_37' data-id='MT27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Above his head they placed the written charge against him: <span class='sc'>this is jesus, the king of the jews</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_38' data-id='MT27_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Two rebels were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. </span>
<span class='v MT27_39' data-id='MT27_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads </span>
<span class='v MT27_40' data-id='MT27_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>and saying, “You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_41' data-id='MT27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_42' data-id='MT27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>“He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! He’s the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_43' data-id='MT27_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MT27_44' data-id='MT27_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>In the same way the rebels who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_45' data-id='MT27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land. </span>
<span class='v MT27_46' data-id='MT27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <span class='tl'>“Eli, Eli,</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2545'><a href='#note-2545' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='tl'>lema</span><span class='tl'>sabachthani?”</span> (which means <span class='wj'>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span>).<span class='note' id='footnote-2546'><a href='#note-2546' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_47' data-id='MT27_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling Elijah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_48' data-id='MT27_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. </span>
<span class='v MT27_49' data-id='MT27_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The rest said, “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_50' data-id='MT27_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_51' data-id='MT27_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, the rocks split </span>
<span class='v MT27_52' data-id='MT27_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>and the tombs broke open. The bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life. </span>
<span class='v MT27_53' data-id='MT27_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>They came out of the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and<span class='note' id='footnote-2547'><a href='#note-2547' class='key'>*</a></span> went into the holy city and appeared to many people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_54' data-id='MT27_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, “Surely he was the Son of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_55' data-id='MT27_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs. </span>
<span class='v MT27_56' data-id='MT27_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph,<span class='note' id='footnote-2548'><a href='#note-2548' class='key'>†</a></span> and the mother of Zebedee’s sons. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Burial of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_57' data-id='MT27_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_58' data-id='MT27_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_59' data-id='MT27_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, </span>
<span class='v MT27_60' data-id='MT27_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away. </span>
<span class='v MT27_61' data-id='MT27_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Guard at the Tomb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_62' data-id='MT27_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v MT27_63' data-id='MT27_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” they said, “we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’ </span>
<span class='v MT27_64' data-id='MT27_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_65' data-id='MT27_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>“Take a guard,” Pilate answered. “Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_66' data-id='MT27_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard. </span></div></div>
