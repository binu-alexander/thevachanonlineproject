<div class='s'>The Demand for a Sign </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_1' data-id='MT16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_2' data-id='MT16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“When evening comes, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,’ </span></span>
<span class='v MT16_3' data-id='MT16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2492'><a href='#note-2492' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v MT16_4' data-id='MT16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>A wicked and adulterous generation looks for a sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.”</span> Jesus then left them and went away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_5' data-id='MT16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When they went across the lake, the disciples forgot to take bread. </span>
<span class='v MT16_6' data-id='MT16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Be careful,”</span> Jesus said to them. <span class='wj'>“Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_7' data-id='MT16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They discussed this among themselves and said, “It is because we didn’t bring any bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_8' data-id='MT16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Aware of their discussion, Jesus asked, <span class='wj'>“You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?</span></span>
<span class='v MT16_9' data-id='MT16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Do you still not understand? Don’t you remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</span></span>
<span class='v MT16_10' data-id='MT16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many basketfuls you gathered?</span></span>
<span class='v MT16_11' data-id='MT16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>How is it you don’t understand that I was not talking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”</span></span>
<span class='v MT16_12' data-id='MT16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread, but against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </span></div>

<span class='v MT16_13' data-id='MT16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_14' data-id='MT16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” </span></div>

<span class='v MT16_15' data-id='MT16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But what about you?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Who do you say I am?”</span></span></div>

<span class='v MT16_20' data-id='MT16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he ordered his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_21' data-id='MT16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_22' data-id='MT16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. “Never, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_23' data-id='MT16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus turned and said to Peter, <span class='wj'>“Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_24' data-id='MT16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.</span></span>
