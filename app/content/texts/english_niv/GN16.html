<div class='s'>Hagar and Ishmael </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_1' data-id='GN16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; </span>
<span class='v GN16_2' data-id='GN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>so she said to Abram, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_2' data-id='GN16_2'>Abram agreed to what Sarai said. </span>
<span class='v GN16_3' data-id='GN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So after Abram had been living in Canaan ten years, Sarai his wife took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife. </span>
<span class='v GN16_4' data-id='GN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_4' data-id='GN16_4'>When she knew she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress. </span>
<span class='v GN16_5' data-id='GN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave in your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> judge between you and me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_6' data-id='GN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Your slave is in your hands,” Abram said. “Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_7' data-id='GN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring that is beside the road to Shur. </span>
<span class='v GN16_8' data-id='GN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_8' data-id='GN16_8'>“I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_9' data-id='GN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_10' data-id='GN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.” </span></div>

<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> also said to her: </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_13' data-id='GN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>She gave this name to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen<span class='note' id='footnote-66'><a href='#note-66' class='key'>‡</a></span> the One who sees me.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_14' data-id='GN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi<span class='note' id='footnote-67'><a href='#note-67' class='key'>§</a></span>; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered. </span></div>
