<div class='s'>Balak Summons Balaam </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_1' data-id='NU22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_2' data-id='NU22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, </span>
<span class='v NU22_3' data-id='NU22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_4' data-id='NU22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde is going to lick up everything around us, as an ox licks up the grass of the field.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_4' data-id='NU22_4'>So Balak son of Zippor, who was king of Moab at that time, </span>
<span class='v NU22_5' data-id='NU22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates River, in his native land. Balak said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_5' data-id='NU22_5'>“A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me. </span>
<span class='v NU22_6' data-id='NU22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now come and put a curse on these people, because they are too powerful for me. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_7' data-id='NU22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The elders of Moab and Midian left, taking with them the fee for divination. When they came to Balaam, they told him what Balak had said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_8' data-id='NU22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Spend the night here,” Balaam said to them, “and I will report back to you with the answer the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gives me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_9' data-id='NU22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_10' data-id='NU22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message: </span>
<span class='v NU22_11' data-id='NU22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>‘A people that has come out of Egypt covers the face of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. Perhaps then I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_12' data-id='NU22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not put a curse on those people, because they are blessed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_13' data-id='NU22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The next morning Balaam got up and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your own country, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has refused to let me go with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_14' data-id='NU22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the Moabite officials returned to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_15' data-id='NU22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first. </span>
<span class='v NU22_16' data-id='NU22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They came to Balaam and said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_16' data-id='NU22_16'>“This is what Balak son of Zippor says: Do not let anything keep you from coming to me, </span>
<span class='v NU22_17' data-id='NU22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>because I will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_18' data-id='NU22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God. </span>
<span class='v NU22_19' data-id='NU22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now spend the night here so that I can find out what else the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will tell me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_20' data-id='NU22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Balaam’s Donkey </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_21' data-id='NU22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey and went with the Moabite officials. </span>
<span class='v NU22_22' data-id='NU22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. </span>
<span class='v NU22_23' data-id='NU22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_24' data-id='NU22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides. </span>
<span class='v NU22_25' data-id='NU22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, it pressed close to the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_26' data-id='NU22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. </span>
<span class='v NU22_27' data-id='NU22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When the donkey saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff. </span>
<span class='v NU22_28' data-id='NU22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_29' data-id='NU22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Balaam answered the donkey, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would kill you right now.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_30' data-id='NU22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden, to this day? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_30' data-id='NU22_30'>“No,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_31' data-id='NU22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_32' data-id='NU22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> asked him, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.<span class='note' id='footnote-467'><a href='#note-467' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v NU22_33' data-id='NU22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If it had not turned away, I would certainly have killed you by now, but I would have spared it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_34' data-id='NU22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Balaam said to the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “I have sinned. I did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me. Now if you are displeased, I will go back.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_35' data-id='NU22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went with Balak’s officials. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_36' data-id='NU22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory. </span>
<span class='v NU22_37' data-id='NU22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_38' data-id='NU22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>“Well, I have come to you now,” Balaam replied. “But I can’t say whatever I please. I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU22_39' data-id='NU22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. </span>
<span class='v NU22_40' data-id='NU22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave some to Balaam and the officials who were with him. </span>
<span class='v NU22_41' data-id='NU22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, and from there he could see the outskirts of the Israelite camp. </span></div></div>
