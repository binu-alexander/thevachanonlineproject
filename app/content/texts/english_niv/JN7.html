<div class='s'>Jesus Goes to the Festival of Tabernacles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_1' data-id='JN7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went around in Galilee. He did not want<span class='note' id='footnote-2732'><a href='#note-2732' class='key'>*</a></span> to go about in Judea because the Jewish leaders there were looking for a way to kill him. </span>
<span class='v JN7_2' data-id='JN7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But when the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was near, </span>
<span class='v JN7_3' data-id='JN7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus’ brothers said to him, “Leave Galilee and go to Judea, so that your disciples there may see the works you do. </span>
<span class='v JN7_4' data-id='JN7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>No one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret. Since you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_5' data-id='JN7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For even his own brothers did not believe in him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_6' data-id='JN7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore Jesus told them, <span class='wj'>“My time is not yet here; for you any time will do.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_7' data-id='JN7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify that its works are evil.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_8' data-id='JN7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You go to the festival. I am not</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2733'><a href='#note-2733' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>going up to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_9' data-id='JN7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After he had said this, he stayed in Galilee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_10' data-id='JN7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went also, not publicly, but in secret. </span>
<span class='v JN7_11' data-id='JN7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were watching for Jesus and asking, “Where is he?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_12' data-id='JN7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him. Some said, “He is a good man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_12' data-id='JN7_12'>Others replied, “No, he deceives the people.” </span>
<span class='v JN7_13' data-id='JN7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the leaders. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Teaches at the Festival </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_14' data-id='JN7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. </span>
<span class='v JN7_15' data-id='JN7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Jews there were amazed and asked, “How did this man get such learning without having been taught?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_16' data-id='JN7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_17' data-id='JN7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Anyone who chooses to do the will of God will find out whether my teaching comes from God or whether I speak on my own.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_18' data-id='JN7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_19' data-id='JN7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Has not Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_20' data-id='JN7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“You are demon-possessed,” the crowd answered. “Who is trying to kill you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_21' data-id='JN7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I did one miracle, and you are all amazed.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_22' data-id='JN7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet, because Moses gave you circumcision (though actually it did not come from Moses, but from the patriarchs), you circumcise a boy on the Sabbath.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_23' data-id='JN7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Now if a boy can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, why are you angry with me for healing a man’s whole body on the Sabbath?</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_24' data-id='JN7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Stop judging by mere appearances, but instead judge correctly.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Division Over Who Jesus Is </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_25' data-id='JN7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At that point some of the people of Jerusalem began to ask, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? </span>
<span class='v JN7_26' data-id='JN7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they are not saying a word to him. Have the authorities really concluded that he is the Messiah? </span>
<span class='v JN7_27' data-id='JN7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But we know where this man is from; when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_28' data-id='JN7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus, still teaching in the temple courts, cried out, <span class='wj'>“Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. You do not know him, </span></span>
<span class='v JN7_29' data-id='JN7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>but I know him because I am from him and he sent me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_30' data-id='JN7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>At this they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. </span>
<span class='v JN7_31' data-id='JN7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Still, many in the crowd believed in him. They said, “When the Messiah comes, will he perform more signs than this man?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_32' data-id='JN7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him. Then the chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_33' data-id='JN7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“I am with you for only a short time, and then I am going to the one who sent me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_34' data-id='JN7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_35' data-id='JN7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him? Will he go where our people live scattered among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? </span>
<span class='v JN7_36' data-id='JN7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>What did he mean when he said, <span class='wj'>‘You will look for me, but you will not find me,’ </span> and <span class='wj'>‘Where I am, you cannot come’</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_37' data-id='JN7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, <span class='wj'>“Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.</span></span>
<span class='v JN7_38' data-id='JN7_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2734'><a href='#note-2734' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN7_39' data-id='JN7_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_40' data-id='JN7_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>On hearing his words, some of the people said, “Surely this man is the Prophet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_41' data-id='JN7_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Others said, “He is the Messiah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_41' data-id='JN7_41'>Still others asked, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee? </span>
<span class='v JN7_42' data-id='JN7_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David’s descendants and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?” </span>
<span class='v JN7_43' data-id='JN7_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN7_44' data-id='JN7_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Unbelief of the Jewish Leaders </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_45' data-id='JN7_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and the Pharisees, who asked them, “Why didn’t you bring him in?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_46' data-id='JN7_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“No one ever spoke the way this man does,” the guards replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_47' data-id='JN7_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>“You mean he has deceived you also?” the Pharisees retorted. </span>
<span class='v JN7_48' data-id='JN7_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>“Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him? </span>
<span class='v JN7_49' data-id='JN7_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>No! But this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_50' data-id='JN7_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus earlier and who was one of their own number, asked, </span>
<span class='v JN7_51' data-id='JN7_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>“Does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he has been doing?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_52' data-id='JN7_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>They replied, “Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does not come out of Galilee.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN7_53' data-id='JN7_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Then they all went home, </span></div></div>
