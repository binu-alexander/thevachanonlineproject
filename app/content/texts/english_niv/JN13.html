<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_1' data-id='JN13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It was just before the Passover Festival. Jesus knew that the hour had come for him to leave this world and go to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_2' data-id='JN13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already prompted Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN13_3' data-id='JN13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God and was returning to God; </span>
<span class='v JN13_4' data-id='JN13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. </span>
<span class='v JN13_5' data-id='JN13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_6' data-id='JN13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_7' data-id='JN13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_8' data-id='JN13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“No,” said Peter, “you shall never wash my feet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_8' data-id='JN13_8'>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_9' data-id='JN13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Then, Lord,” Simon Peter replied, “not just my feet but my hands and my head as well!” </span></div>

<span class='v JN13_10' data-id='JN13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Those who have had a bath need only to wash their feet; their whole body is clean. And you are clean, though not every one of you.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN13_11' data-id='JN13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said not every one was clean. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_12' data-id='JN13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. <span class='wj'>“Do you understand what I have done for you?”</span> he asked them. </span>
<span class='v JN13_13' data-id='JN13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_21' data-id='JN13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>After he had said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_22' data-id='JN13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>His disciples stared at one another, at a loss to know which of them he meant. </span>
<span class='v JN13_23' data-id='JN13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>One of them, the disciple whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to him. </span>
<span class='v JN13_24' data-id='JN13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask him which one he means.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_25' data-id='JN13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Leaning back against Jesus, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?” </span></div>

<span class='v JN13_26' data-id='JN13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.”</span> Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. </span>
<span class='v JN13_27' data-id='JN13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN13_27' data-id='JN13_27'>So Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“What you are about to do, do quickly.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN13_28' data-id='JN13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But no one at the meal understood why Jesus said this to him. </span>
<span class='v JN13_29' data-id='JN13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Since Judas had charge of the money, some thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor. </span>
<span class='v JN13_30' data-id='JN13_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>As soon as Judas had taken the bread, he went out. And it was night. </span></div>
