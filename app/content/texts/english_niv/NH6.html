<div class='s'>Further Opposition to the Rebuilding </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_1' data-id='NH6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When word came to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies that I had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it—though up to that time I had not set the doors in the gates— </span>
<span class='v NH6_2' data-id='NH6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages<span class='note' id='footnote-1281'><a href='#note-1281' class='key'>*</a></span> on the plain of Ono.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_2' data-id='NH6_2'>But they were scheming to harm me; </span>
<span class='v NH6_3' data-id='NH6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>so I sent messengers to them with this reply: “I am carrying on a great project and cannot go down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go down to you?” </span>
<span class='v NH6_4' data-id='NH6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Four times they sent me the same message, and each time I gave them the same answer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_5' data-id='NH6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then, the fifth time, Sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter </span>
<span class='v NH6_6' data-id='NH6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>in which was written: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_6' data-id='NH6_6'>“It is reported among the nations—and Geshem<span class='note' id='footnote-1282'><a href='#note-1282' class='key'>†</a></span> says it is true—that you and the Jews are plotting to revolt, and therefore you are building the wall. Moreover, according to these reports you are about to become their king </span>
<span class='v NH6_7' data-id='NH6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem: ‘There is a king in Judah!’ Now this report will get back to the king; so come, let us meet together.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_8' data-id='NH6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I sent him this reply: “Nothing like what you are saying is happening; you are just making it up out of your head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_9' data-id='NH6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They were all trying to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will get too weak for the work, and it will not be completed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_9' data-id='NH6_9'>But I prayed, “Now strengthen my hands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_10' data-id='NH6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the temple doors, because men are coming to kill you—by night they are coming to kill you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_11' data-id='NH6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Or should someone like me go into the temple to save his life? I will not go!” </span>
<span class='v NH6_12' data-id='NH6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I realized that God had not sent him, but that he had prophesied against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </span>
<span class='v NH6_13' data-id='NH6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He had been hired to intimidate me so that I would commit a sin by doing this, and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_14' data-id='NH6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, my God, because of what they have done; remember also the prophet Noadiah and how she and the rest of the prophets have been trying to intimidate me. </span>
<span class='v NH6_15' data-id='NH6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Opposition to the Completed Wall </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_16' data-id='NH6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When all our enemies heard about this, all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self-confidence, because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_17' data-id='NH6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Also, in those days the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and replies from Tobiah kept coming to them. </span>
<span class='v NH6_18' data-id='NH6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For many in Judah were under oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shekaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. </span>
<span class='v NH6_19' data-id='NH6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Moreover, they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what I said. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me. </span></div></div>
