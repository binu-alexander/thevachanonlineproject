<div class='s'>Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_1' data-id='HB10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming—not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. </span>
<span class='v HB10_2' data-id='HB10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. </span>
<span class='v HB10_3' data-id='HB10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins. </span>
<span class='v HB10_4' data-id='HB10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_5' data-id='HB10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB10_5' data-id='HB10_5'>“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB10_5' data-id='HB10_5'>but a body you prepared for me; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB10_6' data-id='HB10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>with burnt offerings and sin offerings </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB10_6' data-id='HB10_6'>you were not pleased. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB10_7' data-id='HB10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I said, ‘Here I am—it is written about me in the scroll— </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB10_7' data-id='HB10_7'>I have come to do your will, my God.’ ”<span class='note' id='footnote-3188'><a href='#note-3188' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB10_8' data-id='HB10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>First he said, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were offered in accordance with the law. </span>
<span class='v HB10_9' data-id='HB10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “Here I am, I have come to do your will.” He sets aside the first to establish the second. </span>
<span class='v HB10_10' data-id='HB10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And by that will, we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_11' data-id='HB10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. </span>
<span class='v HB10_12' data-id='HB10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, </span>
<span class='v HB10_13' data-id='HB10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool. </span>
<span class='v HB10_14' data-id='HB10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_15' data-id='HB10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: </span></div>

<span class='v HB10_16' data-id='HB10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“This is the covenant I will make with them </span></div>

<span class='v HB10_16' data-id='HB10_16'>after that time, says the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB10_16' data-id='HB10_16'>I will put my laws in their hearts, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB10_16' data-id='HB10_16'>and I will write them on their minds.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3189'><a href='#note-3189' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB10_17' data-id='HB10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then he adds: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB10_17' data-id='HB10_17'>“Their sins and lawless acts </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB10_17' data-id='HB10_17'>I will remember no more.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3190'><a href='#note-3190' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_18' data-id='HB10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And where these have been forgiven, sacrifice for sin is no longer necessary. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Call to Persevere in Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_19' data-id='HB10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus, </span>
<span class='v HB10_20' data-id='HB10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain, that is, his body, </span>
<span class='v HB10_21' data-id='HB10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and since we have a great priest over the house of God, </span>
<span class='v HB10_22' data-id='HB10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance that faith brings, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. </span>
<span class='v HB10_23' data-id='HB10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. </span>
<span class='v HB10_24' data-id='HB10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, </span>
<span class='v HB10_25' data-id='HB10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_26' data-id='HB10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, </span>
<span class='v HB10_27' data-id='HB10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. </span>
<span class='v HB10_28' data-id='HB10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. </span>
<span class='v HB10_29' data-id='HB10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? </span>
<span class='v HB10_30' data-id='HB10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3191'><a href='#note-3191' class='key'>§</a></span> and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3192'><a href='#note-3192' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v HB10_31' data-id='HB10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_32' data-id='HB10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Remember those earlier days after you had received the light, when you endured in a great conflict full of suffering. </span>
<span class='v HB10_33' data-id='HB10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated. </span>
<span class='v HB10_34' data-id='HB10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>You suffered along with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions. </span>
<span class='v HB10_35' data-id='HB10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So do not throw away your confidence; it will be richly rewarded. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB10_36' data-id='HB10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised. </span>
