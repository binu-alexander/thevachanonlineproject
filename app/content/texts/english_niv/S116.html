<div class='s'>Samuel Anoints David </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_1' data-id='S116_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Samuel, “How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem. I have chosen one of his sons to be king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_2' data-id='S116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_2' data-id='S116_2'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ </span>
<span class='v S116_3' data-id='S116_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do. You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_4' data-id='S116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Samuel did what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him. They asked, “Do you come in peace?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_5' data-id='S116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Samuel replied, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.” Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_6' data-id='S116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, “Surely the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed stands here before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_7' data-id='S116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> looks at the heart.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_8' data-id='S116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not chosen this one either.” </span>
<span class='v S116_9' data-id='S116_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> chosen this one.” </span>
<span class='v S116_10' data-id='S116_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not chosen these.” </span>
<span class='v S116_11' data-id='S116_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_11' data-id='S116_11'>“There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_11' data-id='S116_11'>Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_12' data-id='S116_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_12' data-id='S116_12'>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_13' data-id='S116_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah. </span></div>
<div class='s'>David in Saul’s Service </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_14' data-id='S116_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had departed from Saul, and an evil<span class='note' id='footnote-721'><a href='#note-721' class='key'>*</a></span> spirit from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> tormented him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_15' data-id='S116_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Saul’s attendants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. </span>
<span class='v S116_16' data-id='S116_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the lyre. He will play when the evil spirit from God comes on you, and you will feel better.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_17' data-id='S116_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Saul said to his attendants, “Find someone who plays well and bring him to me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_18' data-id='S116_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>One of the servants answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is a brave man and a warrior. He speaks well and is a fine-looking man. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_19' data-id='S116_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” </span>
<span class='v S116_20' data-id='S116_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son David to Saul. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_21' data-id='S116_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much, and David became one of his armor-bearers. </span>
<span class='v S116_22' data-id='S116_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Allow David to remain in my service, for I am pleased with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S116_23' data-id='S116_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him. </span></div></div>
