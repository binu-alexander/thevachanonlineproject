<span class='v JH3_1' data-id='JH3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jonah a second time: </span>
<span class='v JH3_2' data-id='JH3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_3' data-id='JH3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jonah obeyed the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and went to Nineveh. Now Nineveh was a very large city; it took three days to go through it. </span>
<span class='v JH3_4' data-id='JH3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jonah began by going a day’s journey into the city, proclaiming, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be overthrown.” </span>
<span class='v JH3_5' data-id='JH3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Ninevites believed God. A fast was proclaimed, and all of them, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_6' data-id='JH3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Jonah’s warning reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, took off his royal robes, covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust. </span>
<span class='v JH3_7' data-id='JH3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is the proclamation he issued in Nineveh: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_7' data-id='JH3_7'>“By the decree of the king and his nobles: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_7' data-id='JH3_7'>Do not let people or animals, herds or flocks, taste anything; do not let them eat or drink. </span>
<span class='v JH3_8' data-id='JH3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But let people and animals be covered with sackcloth. Let everyone call urgently on God. Let them give up their evil ways and their violence. </span>
<span class='v JH3_9' data-id='JH3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Who knows? God may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JH3_10' data-id='JH3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways, he relented and did not bring on them the destruction he had threatened. </span></div></div>
