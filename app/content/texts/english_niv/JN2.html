<div class='s'>Jesus Changes Water Into Wine </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_1' data-id='JN2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, </span>
<span class='v JN2_2' data-id='JN2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. </span>
<span class='v JN2_3' data-id='JN2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_4' data-id='JN2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Woman, </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2709'><a href='#note-2709' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>why do you involve me?”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“My hour has not yet come.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_5' data-id='JN2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_6' data-id='JN2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.<span class='note' id='footnote-2710'><a href='#note-2710' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_7' data-id='JN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the servants, <span class='wj'>“Fill the jars with water”</span>; so they filled them to the brim. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_8' data-id='JN2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he told them, <span class='wj'>“Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_8' data-id='JN2_8'>They did so, </span>
<span class='v JN2_9' data-id='JN2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside </span>
<span class='v JN2_10' data-id='JN2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and said, “Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_11' data-id='JN2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_12' data-id='JN2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples. There they stayed for a few days. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Clears the Temple Courts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_13' data-id='JN2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JN2_14' data-id='JN2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. </span>
<span class='v JN2_15' data-id='JN2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. </span>
<span class='v JN2_16' data-id='JN2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To those who sold doves he said, <span class='wj'>“Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!”</span></span>
<span class='v JN2_17' data-id='JN2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for your house will consume me.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2711'><a href='#note-2711' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_18' data-id='JN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Jews then responded to him, “What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_19' data-id='JN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_20' data-id='JN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” </span>
<span class='v JN2_21' data-id='JN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But the temple he had spoken of was his body. </span>
<span class='v JN2_22' data-id='JN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>After he was raised from the dead, his disciples recalled what he had said. Then they believed the scripture and the words that Jesus had spoken. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN2_23' data-id='JN2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now while he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.<span class='note' id='footnote-2712'><a href='#note-2712' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN2_24' data-id='JN2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people. </span>
<span class='v JN2_25' data-id='JN2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He did not need any testimony about mankind, for he knew what was in each person. </span></div></div>
