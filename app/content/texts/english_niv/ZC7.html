<span class='v ZC7_1' data-id='ZC7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_2' data-id='ZC7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, together with their men, to entreat the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></span>
<span class='v ZC7_3' data-id='ZC7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>by asking the priests of the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty and the prophets, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_4' data-id='ZC7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty came to me: </span>
<span class='v ZC7_5' data-id='ZC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Ask all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, was it really for me that you fasted? </span>
<span class='v ZC7_6' data-id='ZC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when you were eating and drinking, were you not just feasting for yourselves? </span>
<span class='v ZC7_7' data-id='ZC7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Are these not the words the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> proclaimed through the earlier prophets when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous, and the Negev and the western foothills were settled?’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_8' data-id='ZC7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came again to Zechariah: </span>
<span class='v ZC7_9' data-id='ZC7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty said: ‘Administer true justice; show mercy and compassion to one another. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_10' data-id='ZC7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_11' data-id='ZC7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“But they refused to pay attention; stubbornly they turned their backs and covered their ears. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_12' data-id='ZC7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty had sent by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty was very angry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC7_13' data-id='ZC7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“ ‘When I called, they did not listen; so when they called, I would not listen,’ says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v ZC7_14' data-id='ZC7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>‘I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations, where they were strangers. The land they left behind them was so desolate that no one traveled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’ ” </span></div></div>
