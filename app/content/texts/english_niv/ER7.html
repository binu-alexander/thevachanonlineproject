<span class='v ER7_23' data-id='ER7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whatever the God of heaven has prescribed, let it be done with diligence for the temple of the God of heaven. Why should his wrath fall on the realm of the king and of his sons? </span>
<span class='v ER7_24' data-id='ER7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God. </span></div>

<span class='v ER7_26' data-id='ER7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king must surely be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.<span class='note' id='footnote-1258'><a href='#note-1258' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>

<span class='v ER7_27' data-id='ER7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors, who has put it into the king’s heart to bring honor to the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in Jerusalem in this way </span>
<span class='v ER7_28' data-id='ER7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the king’s powerful officials.
