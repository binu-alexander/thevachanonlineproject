<div class='s'>The Authority of Jesus Questioned </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_1' data-id='LK20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One day as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, together with the elders, came up to him. </span>
<span class='v LK20_2' data-id='LK20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Tell us by what authority you are doing these things,” they said. “Who gave you this authority?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_3' data-id='LK20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“I will also ask you a question. Tell me:</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_4' data-id='LK20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>John’s baptism—was it from heaven, or of human origin?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_5' data-id='LK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v LK20_6' data-id='LK20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people will stone us, because they are persuaded that John was a prophet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_7' data-id='LK20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So they answered, “We don’t know where it was from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_8' data-id='LK20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Tenants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_9' data-id='LK20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He went on to tell the people this parable: <span class='wj'>“A man planted a vineyard, rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time.</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_10' data-id='LK20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_11' data-id='LK20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_12' data-id='LK20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_13' data-id='LK20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_14' data-id='LK20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. ‘This is the heir,’ they said. ‘Let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK20_15' data-id='LK20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_15' data-id='LK20_15'><span class='wj'>“What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_16' data-id='LK20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_16' data-id='LK20_16'>When the people heard this, they said, “God forbid!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus looked directly at them and asked, <span class='wj'>“Then what is the meaning of that which is written: </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'><span class='wj'>“ ‘The stone the builders rejected </span></span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK20_18' data-id='LK20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_19' data-id='LK20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paying Taxes to Caesar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_20' data-id='LK20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Keeping a close watch on him, they sent spies, who pretended to be sincere. They hoped to catch Jesus in something he said, so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor. </span>
<span class='v LK20_21' data-id='LK20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So the spies questioned him: “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach what is right, and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. </span>
<span class='v LK20_22' data-id='LK20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_23' data-id='LK20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He saw through their duplicity and said to them, </span>
<span class='v LK20_24' data-id='LK20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_24' data-id='LK20_24'>“Caesar’s,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_25' data-id='LK20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Then give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_26' data-id='LK20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public. And astonished by his answer, they became silent. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Resurrection and Marriage </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_27' data-id='LK20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus with a question. </span>
<span class='v LK20_28' data-id='LK20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class='v LK20_29' data-id='LK20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died childless. </span>
<span class='v LK20_30' data-id='LK20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The second </span>
<span class='v LK20_31' data-id='LK20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and then the third married her, and in the same way the seven died, leaving no children. </span>
<span class='v LK20_32' data-id='LK20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Finally, the woman died too. </span>
<span class='v LK20_33' data-id='LK20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since the seven were married to her?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_34' data-id='LK20_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“The people of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_35' data-id='LK20_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage, </span></span>
<span class='v LK20_36' data-id='LK20_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, since they are children of the resurrection.</span></span>
<span class='v LK20_37' data-id='LK20_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses showed that the dead rise, for he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2687'><a href='#note-2687' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v LK20_38' data-id='LK20_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for to him all are alive.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_39' data-id='LK20_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Some of the teachers of the law responded, “Well said, teacher!” </span>
<span class='v LK20_40' data-id='LK20_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And no one dared to ask him any more questions. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_41' data-id='LK20_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?</span></span>
