<span class='v J31_2' data-id='J31_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well. </span>
<span class='v J31_3' data-id='J31_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It gave me great joy when some believers came and testified about your faithfulness to the truth, telling how you continue to walk in it. </span>

<span class='v J31_6' data-id='J31_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They have told the church about your love. Please send them on their way in a manner that honors God. </span>

<span class='v J31_10' data-id='J31_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So when I come, I will call attention to what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us. Not satisfied with that, he even refuses to welcome other believers. He also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church. </span></div>

<span class='v J31_11' data-id='J31_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil but what is good. Anyone who does what is good is from God. Anyone who does what is evil has not seen God. </span>
