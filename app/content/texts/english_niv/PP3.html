<div class='s'>No Confidence in the Flesh </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_1' data-id='PP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Further, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it is a safeguard for you. </span>
<span class='v PP3_2' data-id='PP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh. </span>
<span class='v PP3_3' data-id='PP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For it is we who are the circumcision, we who serve God by his Spirit, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh— </span>
<span class='v PP3_4' data-id='PP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>though I myself have reasons for such confidence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_4' data-id='PP3_4'>If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more: </span>
<span class='v PP3_5' data-id='PP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; in regard to the law, a Pharisee; </span>
<span class='v PP3_6' data-id='PP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>as for zeal, persecuting the church; as for righteousness based on the law, faultless. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_7' data-id='PP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP3_8' data-id='PP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ </span>
<span class='v PP3_9' data-id='PP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in<span class='note' id='footnote-3092'><a href='#note-3092' class='key'>*</a></span> Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. </span>
<span class='v PP3_10' data-id='PP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, </span>
<span class='v PP3_11' data-id='PP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_12' data-id='PP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. </span>
<span class='v PP3_13' data-id='PP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, </span>
<span class='v PP3_14' data-id='PP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Following Paul’s Example </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_15' data-id='PP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if on some point you think differently, that too God will make clear to you. </span>
<span class='v PP3_16' data-id='PP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Only let us live up to what we have already attained. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_17' data-id='PP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and just as you have us as a model, keep your eyes on those who live as we do. </span>
<span class='v PP3_18' data-id='PP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP3_19' data-id='PP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things. </span>
<span class='v PP3_20' data-id='PP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But our citizenship is in heaven. And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP3_21' data-id='PP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body. </span></div></div>
