<span class='v R221_1' data-id='R221_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David. And Jehoram his son succeeded him as king. </span>
<span class='v R221_2' data-id='R221_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jehoram’s brothers, the sons of Jehoshaphat, were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael and Shephatiah. All these were sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.<span class='note' id='footnote-1187'><a href='#note-1187' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v R221_3' data-id='R221_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value, as well as fortified cities in Judah, but he had given the kingdom to Jehoram because he was his firstborn son. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jehoram King of Judah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_4' data-id='R221_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When Jehoram established himself firmly over his father’s kingdom, he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the officials of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R221_5' data-id='R221_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. </span>
<span class='v R221_6' data-id='R221_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for he married a daughter of Ahab. He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R221_7' data-id='R221_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, because of the covenant the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had made with David, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not willing to destroy the house of David. He had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_8' data-id='R221_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the time of Jehoram, Edom rebelled against Judah and set up its own king. </span>
<span class='v R221_9' data-id='R221_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he rose up and broke through by night. </span>
<span class='v R221_10' data-id='R221_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>To this day Edom has been in rebellion against Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_10' data-id='R221_10'>Libnah revolted at the same time, because Jehoram had forsaken the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of his ancestors. </span>
<span class='v R221_11' data-id='R221_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He had also built high places on the hills of Judah and had caused the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led Judah astray. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_12' data-id='R221_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jehoram received a letter from Elijah the prophet, which said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_12' data-id='R221_12'>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your father David, says: ‘You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or of Asa king of Judah. </span>
<span class='v R221_13' data-id='R221_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel, and you have led Judah and the people of Jerusalem to prostitute themselves, just as the house of Ahab did. You have also murdered your own brothers, members of your own family, men who were better than you. </span>
<span class='v R221_14' data-id='R221_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is about to strike your people, your sons, your wives and everything that is yours, with a heavy blow. </span>
<span class='v R221_15' data-id='R221_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels, until the disease causes your bowels to come out.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_16' data-id='R221_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> aroused against Jehoram the hostility of the Philistines and of the Arabs who lived near the Cushites. </span>
<span class='v R221_17' data-id='R221_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They attacked Judah, invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the king’s palace, together with his sons and wives. Not a son was left to him except Ahaziah,<span class='note' id='footnote-1188'><a href='#note-1188' class='key'>†</a></span> the youngest. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_18' data-id='R221_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>After all this, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> afflicted Jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels. </span>
<span class='v R221_19' data-id='R221_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In the course of time, at the end of the second year, his bowels came out because of the disease, and he died in great pain. His people made no funeral fire in his honor, as they had for his predecessors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R221_20' data-id='R221_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
