<div class='s'>Warning to Pay Attention </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_1' data-id='HB2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>We must pay the most careful attention, therefore, to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. </span>
<span class='v HB2_2' data-id='HB2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For since the message spoken through angels was binding, and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment, </span>
<span class='v HB2_3' data-id='HB2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>how shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him. </span>
<span class='v HB2_4' data-id='HB2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>God also testified to it by signs, wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Made Fully Human </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_5' data-id='HB2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking. </span>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But there is a place where someone has testified: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>“What is mankind that you are mindful of them, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>a son of man that you care for him? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You made them a little<span class='note' id='footnote-3151'><a href='#note-3151' class='key'>*</a></span> lower than the angels; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'>you crowned them with glory and honor </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and put everything under their feet.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3152'><a href='#note-3152' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='note' id='footnote-3153'><a href='#note-3153' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>

<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'>In putting everything under them,<span class='note' id='footnote-3154'><a href='#note-3154' class='key'>§</a></span> God left nothing that is not subject to them.<span class='note' id='footnote-3155'><a href='#note-3155' class='key'>*</a></span> Yet at present we do not see everything subject to them.<span class='note' id='footnote-3156'><a href='#note-3156' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v HB2_9' data-id='HB2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_10' data-id='HB2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through what he suffered. </span>
<span class='v HB2_11' data-id='HB2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_14' data-id='HB2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil— </span>
<span class='v HB2_15' data-id='HB2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death. </span>
<span class='v HB2_16' data-id='HB2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham’s descendants. </span>
<span class='v HB2_17' data-id='HB2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this reason he had to be made like them,<span class='note' id='footnote-3161'><a href='#note-3161' class='key'>‡</a></span> fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. </span>
<span class='v HB2_18' data-id='HB2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. </span></div></div>
