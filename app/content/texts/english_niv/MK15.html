<div class='s'>Jesus Before Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_1' data-id='MK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, made their plans. So they bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_2' data-id='MK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Are you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_2' data-id='MK15_2'><span class='wj'>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_3' data-id='MK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The chief priests accused him of many things. </span>
<span class='v MK15_4' data-id='MK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So again Pilate asked him, “Aren’t you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you of.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_5' data-id='MK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_6' data-id='MK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now it was the custom at the festival to release a prisoner whom the people requested. </span>
<span class='v MK15_7' data-id='MK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A man called Barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising. </span>
<span class='v MK15_8' data-id='MK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The crowd came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_9' data-id='MK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Do you want me to release to you the king of the Jews?” asked Pilate, </span>
<span class='v MK15_10' data-id='MK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>knowing it was out of self-interest that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_11' data-id='MK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_12' data-id='MK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king of the Jews?” Pilate asked them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_13' data-id='MK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Crucify him!” they shouted. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_14' data-id='MK15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Why? What crime has he committed?” asked Pilate. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_14' data-id='MK15_14'>But they shouted all the louder, “Crucify him!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_15' data-id='MK15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Soldiers Mock Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_16' data-id='MK15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and called together the whole company of soldiers. </span>
<span class='v MK15_17' data-id='MK15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They put a purple robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_18' data-id='MK15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they began to call out to him, “Hail, king of the Jews!” </span>
<span class='v MK15_19' data-id='MK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling on their knees, they paid homage to him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_20' data-id='MK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_21' data-id='MK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry the cross. </span>
<span class='v MK15_22' data-id='MK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means “the place of the skull”). </span>
<span class='v MK15_23' data-id='MK15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. </span>
<span class='v MK15_24' data-id='MK15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they crucified him. Dividing up his clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_25' data-id='MK15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_26' data-id='MK15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The written notice of the charge against him read: <span class='sc'>the king of the jews</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_27' data-id='MK15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They crucified two rebels with him, one on his right and one on his left.<span class='note' id='footnote-2617'><a href='#note-2617' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v MK15_29' data-id='MK15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, “So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, </span>
<span class='v MK15_30' data-id='MK15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>come down from the cross and save yourself!” </span>
<span class='v MK15_31' data-id='MK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>In the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves. “He saved others,” they said, “but he can’t save himself! </span>
<span class='v MK15_32' data-id='MK15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Let this Messiah, this king of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with him also heaped insults on him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_33' data-id='MK15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. </span>
<span class='v MK15_34' data-id='MK15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And at three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, <span class='tl'>“Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?”</span> (which means <span class='wj'>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span>).<span class='note' id='footnote-2618'><a href='#note-2618' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_35' data-id='MK15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, “Listen, he’s calling Elijah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_36' data-id='MK15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Someone ran, filled a sponge with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink. “Now leave him alone. Let’s see if Elijah comes to take him down,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_37' data-id='MK15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>With a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_38' data-id='MK15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. </span>
<span class='v MK15_39' data-id='MK15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when the centurion, who stood there in front of Jesus, saw how he died,<span class='note' id='footnote-2619'><a href='#note-2619' class='key'>‡</a></span> he said, “Surely this man was the Son of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_40' data-id='MK15_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph,<span class='note' id='footnote-2620'><a href='#note-2620' class='key'>§</a></span> and Salome. </span>
<span class='v MK15_41' data-id='MK15_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Burial of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_42' data-id='MK15_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, </span>
<span class='v MK15_43' data-id='MK15_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. </span>
<span class='v MK15_44' data-id='MK15_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. </span>
<span class='v MK15_45' data-id='MK15_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. </span>
<span class='v MK15_46' data-id='MK15_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MK15_47' data-id='MK15_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid. </span></div></div>
