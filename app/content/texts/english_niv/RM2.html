<div class='s'>God’s Righteous Judgment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_1' data-id='RM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_2' data-id='RM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. </span>
<span class='v RM2_3' data-id='RM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So when you, a mere human being, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment? </span>
<span class='v RM2_4' data-id='RM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_5' data-id='RM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed. </span>
<span class='v RM2_6' data-id='RM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>God “will repay each person according to what they have done.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2861'><a href='#note-2861' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM2_7' data-id='RM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. </span>
<span class='v RM2_8' data-id='RM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger. </span>
<span class='v RM2_9' data-id='RM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; </span>
<span class='v RM2_10' data-id='RM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. </span>
<span class='v RM2_11' data-id='RM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For God does not show favoritism. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_12' data-id='RM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_13' data-id='RM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous. </span>
<span class='v RM2_14' data-id='RM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>(Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_15' data-id='RM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times even defending them.) </span>
<span class='v RM2_16' data-id='RM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This will take place on the day when God judges people’s secrets through Jesus Christ, as my gospel declares. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Jews and the Law </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_17' data-id='RM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God; </span>
<span class='v RM2_18' data-id='RM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law; </span>
<span class='v RM2_19' data-id='RM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in the dark, </span>
<span class='v RM2_20' data-id='RM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— </span>
<span class='v RM2_21' data-id='RM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? </span>
<span class='v RM2_22' data-id='RM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? </span>
<span class='v RM2_23' data-id='RM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law? </span>
<span class='v RM2_24' data-id='RM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2862'><a href='#note-2862' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_25' data-id='RM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised. </span>
<span class='v RM2_26' data-id='RM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So then, if those who are not circumcised keep the law’s requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised? </span>
<span class='v RM2_27' data-id='RM2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who, even though you have the<span class='note' id='footnote-2863'><a href='#note-2863' class='key'>‡</a></span> written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_28' data-id='RM2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. </span>
<span class='v RM2_29' data-id='RM2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person’s praise is not from other people, but from God. </span></div></div>
