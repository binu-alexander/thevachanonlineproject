<div class='s'>[The earliest manuscripts and many other ancient witnesses do not have John 7:53—8:11. A few manuscripts include these verses, wholly or in part, after John 7:36, John 21:25, Luke 21:38 or Luke 24:53.] </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_1' data-id='JN8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_2' data-id='JN8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. </span>
<span class='v JN8_3' data-id='JN8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group </span>
<span class='v JN8_4' data-id='JN8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. </span>
<span class='v JN8_5' data-id='JN8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?” </span>
<span class='v JN8_6' data-id='JN8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_6' data-id='JN8_6'>But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. </span>
<span class='v JN8_7' data-id='JN8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” </span>
<span class='v JN8_8' data-id='JN8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_9' data-id='JN8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. </span>
<span class='v JN8_10' data-id='JN8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_11' data-id='JN8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“No one, sir,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_11' data-id='JN8_11'>“Then neither do I condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Dispute Over Jesus’ Testimony </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_12' data-id='JN8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, <span class='wj'>“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_13' data-id='JN8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_14' data-id='JN8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_15' data-id='JN8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_16' data-id='JN8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_17' data-id='JN8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_18' data-id='JN8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_19' data-id='JN8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, “Where is your father?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_19' data-id='JN8_19'><span class='wj'>“You do not know me or my Father,”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“If you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_20' data-id='JN8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Dispute Over Who Jesus Is </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_21' data-id='JN8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Once more Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I am going away, and you will look for me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_22' data-id='JN8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>This made the Jews ask, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, <span class='wj'>‘Where I go, you cannot come’</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_23' data-id='JN8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he continued, <span class='wj'>“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_24' data-id='JN8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am he, you will indeed die in your sins.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_25' data-id='JN8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“Who are you?” they asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_25' data-id='JN8_25'><span class='wj'>“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”</span> Jesus replied. </span>
<span class='v JN8_26' data-id='JN8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I have much to say in judgment of you. But he who sent me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from him I tell the world.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_27' data-id='JN8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father. </span>
<span class='v JN8_28' data-id='JN8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“When you have lifted up</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2735'><a href='#note-2735' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_29' data-id='JN8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_30' data-id='JN8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Even as he spoke, many believed in him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Dispute Over Whose Children Jesus’ Opponents Are </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_31' data-id='JN8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_32' data-id='JN8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_33' data-id='JN8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_34' data-id='JN8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_35' data-id='JN8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_36' data-id='JN8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_37' data-id='JN8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_38' data-id='JN8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2736'><a href='#note-2736' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_39' data-id='JN8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>“Abraham is our father,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_39' data-id='JN8_39'><span class='wj'>“If you were Abraham’s children,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“then you would</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2737'><a href='#note-2737' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>do what Abraham did.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_40' data-id='JN8_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_41' data-id='JN8_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You are doing the works of your own father.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_41' data-id='JN8_41'>“We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_42' data-id='JN8_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN8_43' data-id='JN8_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.</span></span>

<span class='v JN8_45' data-id='JN8_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!</span></span>

<span class='v JN8_48' data-id='JN8_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_49' data-id='JN8_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I am not possessed by a demon,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_52' data-id='JN8_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. </span>
<span class='v JN8_53' data-id='JN8_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN8_54' data-id='JN8_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.</span></span>
