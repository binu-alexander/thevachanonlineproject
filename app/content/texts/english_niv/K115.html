<span class='v K115_2' data-id='K115_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom.<span class='note' id='footnote-909'><a href='#note-909' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_3' data-id='K115_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He committed all the sins his father had done before him; his heart was not fully devoted to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his forefather had been. </span>
<span class='v K115_4' data-id='K115_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, for David’s sake the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making Jerusalem strong. </span>
<span class='v K115_5' data-id='K115_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For David had done what was right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and had not failed to keep any of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s commands all the days of his life—except in the case of Uriah the Hittite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_6' data-id='K115_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There was war between Abijah<span class='note' id='footnote-910'><a href='#note-910' class='key'>‡</a></span> and Jeroboam throughout Abijah’s lifetime. </span>
<span class='v K115_7' data-id='K115_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of Abijah’s reign, and all he did, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </span>
<span class='v K115_8' data-id='K115_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Abijah rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Asa his son succeeded him as king. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_9' data-id='K115_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah, </span>
<span class='v K115_10' data-id='K115_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and he reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother’s name was Maakah daughter of Abishalom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_11' data-id='K115_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Asa did what was right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, as his father David had done. </span>
<span class='v K115_12' data-id='K115_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his ancestors had made. </span>
<span class='v K115_13' data-id='K115_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He even deposed his grandmother Maakah from her position as queen mother, because she had made a repulsive image for the worship of Asherah. Asa cut it down and burned it in the Kidron Valley. </span>
<span class='v K115_14' data-id='K115_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Although he did not remove the high places, Asa’s heart was fully committed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> all his life. </span>
<span class='v K115_15' data-id='K115_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He brought into the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_16' data-id='K115_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel throughout their reigns. </span>
<span class='v K115_17' data-id='K115_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and fortified Ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of Asa king of Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_18' data-id='K115_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple and of his own palace. He entrusted it to his officials and sent them to Ben-Hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus. </span>
<span class='v K115_19' data-id='K115_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Let there be a treaty between me and you,” he said, “as there was between my father and your father.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_20' data-id='K115_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Beth Maakah and all Kinnereth in addition to Naphtali. </span>
<span class='v K115_21' data-id='K115_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When Baasha heard this, he stopped building Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah. </span>
<span class='v K115_22' data-id='K115_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then King Asa issued an order to all Judah—no one was exempt—and they carried away from Ramah the stones and timber Baasha had been using there. With them King Asa built up Geba in Benjamin, and also Mizpah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_23' data-id='K115_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As for all the other events of Asa’s reign, all his achievements, all he did and the cities he built, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Judah? In his old age, however, his feet became diseased. </span>
<span class='v K115_24' data-id='K115_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Asa rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his father David. And Jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Nadab King of Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_25' data-id='K115_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. </span>
<span class='v K115_26' data-id='K115_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, following the ways of his father and committing the same sin his father had caused Israel to commit. </span></div>

<span class='v K115_27' data-id='K115_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Baasha son of Ahijah from the tribe of Issachar plotted against him, and he struck him down at Gibbethon, a Philistine town, while Nadab and all Israel were besieging it. </span>
<span class='v K115_28' data-id='K115_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of Asa king of Judah and succeeded him as king. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K115_29' data-id='K115_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As soon as he began to reign, he killed Jeroboam’s whole family. He did not leave Jeroboam anyone that breathed, but destroyed them all, according to the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> given through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. </span>
<span class='v K115_30' data-id='K115_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>This happened because of the sins Jeroboam had committed and had caused Israel to commit, and because he aroused the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. </span></div>
