<div class='s'>Micaiah Prophesies Against Ahab </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_1' data-id='R218_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor, and he allied himself with Ahab by marriage. </span>
<span class='v R218_2' data-id='R218_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some years later he went down to see Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class='v R218_3' data-id='R218_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me against Ramoth Gilead?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_3' data-id='R218_3'>Jehoshaphat replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will join you in the war.” </span>
<span class='v R218_4' data-id='R218_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Jehoshaphat also said to the king of Israel, “First seek the counsel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_5' data-id='R218_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_5' data-id='R218_5'>“Go,” they answered, “for God will give it into the king’s hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_6' data-id='R218_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there no longer a prophet of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> here whom we can inquire of?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_7' data-id='R218_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The king of Israel answered Jehoshaphat, “There is still one prophet through whom we can inquire of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me, but always bad. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_7' data-id='R218_7'>“The king should not say such a thing,” Jehoshaphat replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_8' data-id='R218_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_9' data-id='R218_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Dressed in their royal robes, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them. </span>
<span class='v R218_10' data-id='R218_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he declared, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_11' data-id='R218_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>All the other prophets were prophesying the same thing. “Attack Ramoth Gilead and be victorious,” they said, “for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will give it into the king’s hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_12' data-id='R218_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The messenger who had gone to summon Micaiah said to him, “Look, the other prophets without exception are predicting success for the king. Let your word agree with theirs, and speak favorably.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_13' data-id='R218_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But Micaiah said, “As surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives, I can tell him only what my God says.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_14' data-id='R218_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he arrived, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth Gilead, or shall I not?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_14' data-id='R218_14'>“Attack and be victorious,” he answered, “for they will be given into your hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_15' data-id='R218_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_16' data-id='R218_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Micaiah answered, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, ‘These people have no master. Let each one go home in peace.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_17' data-id='R218_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_18' data-id='R218_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Micaiah continued, “Therefore hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: I saw the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sitting on his throne with all the multitudes of heaven standing on his right and on his left. </span>
<span class='v R218_19' data-id='R218_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel into attacking Ramoth Gilead and going to his death there?’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_19' data-id='R218_19'>“One suggested this, and another that. </span>
<span class='v R218_20' data-id='R218_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Finally, a spirit came forward, stood before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, ‘I will entice him.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_20' data-id='R218_20'>“ ‘By what means?’ the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_21' data-id='R218_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“ ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_21' data-id='R218_21'>“ ‘You will succeed in enticing him,’ said the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. ‘Go and do it.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_22' data-id='R218_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“So now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has decreed disaster for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_23' data-id='R218_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah went up and slapped Micaiah in the face. “Which way did the spirit from<span class='note' id='footnote-1178'><a href='#note-1178' class='key'>*</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> go when he went from me to speak to you?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_24' data-id='R218_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_25' data-id='R218_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The king of Israel then ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon the ruler of the city and to Joash the king’s son, </span>
<span class='v R218_26' data-id='R218_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_27' data-id='R218_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not spoken through me.” Then he added, “Mark my words, all you people!” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Ahab Killed at Ramoth Gilead </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_28' data-id='R218_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. </span>
<span class='v R218_29' data-id='R218_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will enter the battle in disguise, but you wear your royal robes.” So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_30' data-id='R218_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.” </span>
<span class='v R218_31' data-id='R218_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “This is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> helped him. God drew them away from him, </span>
<span class='v R218_32' data-id='R218_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R218_33' data-id='R218_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between the breastplate and the scale armor. The king told the chariot driver, “Wheel around and get me out of the fighting. I’ve been wounded.” </span>
<span class='v R218_34' data-id='R218_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>All day long the battle raged, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then at sunset he died. </span></div></div>
