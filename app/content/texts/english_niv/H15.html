<div class='s'>The Day of the Lord </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H15_1' data-id='H15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, </span>
<span class='v H15_2' data-id='H15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. </span>
<span class='v H15_3' data-id='H15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H15_4' data-id='H15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. </span>
<span class='v H15_5' data-id='H15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. </span>
<span class='v H15_6' data-id='H15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. </span>
<span class='v H15_7' data-id='H15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. </span>
<span class='v H15_8' data-id='H15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. </span>
<span class='v H15_9' data-id='H15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v H15_10' data-id='H15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him. </span>
<span class='v H15_11' data-id='H15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing. </span></div>
