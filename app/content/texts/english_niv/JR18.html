<div class='s'>At the Potter’s House </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_1' data-id='JR18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v JR18_2' data-id='JR18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Go down to the potter’s house, and there I will give you my message.” </span>
<span class='v JR18_3' data-id='JR18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I went down to the potter’s house, and I saw him working at the wheel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_4' data-id='JR18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands; so the potter formed it into another pot, shaping it as seemed best to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_5' data-id='JR18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me. </span>
<span class='v JR18_6' data-id='JR18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said, “Can I not do with you, Israel, as this potter does?” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. “Like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, Israel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_7' data-id='JR18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, </span>
<span class='v JR18_8' data-id='JR18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned. </span>
<span class='v JR18_9' data-id='JR18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And if at another time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted, </span>
<span class='v JR18_10' data-id='JR18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me, then I will reconsider the good I had intended to do for it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_11' data-id='JR18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’ </span>
<span class='v JR18_12' data-id='JR18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; we will all follow the stubbornness of our evil hearts.’ ” </span></div>
