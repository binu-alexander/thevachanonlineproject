<div class='s'>The Plot Against Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_1' data-id='MT26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v MT26_2' data-id='MT26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“As you know, the Passover is two days away—and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_3' data-id='MT26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, </span>
<span class='v MT26_4' data-id='MT26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and they schemed to arrest Jesus secretly and kill him. </span>
<span class='v MT26_5' data-id='MT26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“But not during the festival,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_6' data-id='MT26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper, </span>
<span class='v MT26_7' data-id='MT26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume, which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_8' data-id='MT26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw this, they were indignant. “Why this waste?” they asked. </span>
<span class='v MT26_9' data-id='MT26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“This perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_10' data-id='MT26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Aware of this, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful thing to me.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_11' data-id='MT26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The poor you will always have with you, </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2538'><a href='#note-2538' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>but you will not always have me.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_12' data-id='MT26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When she poured this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_13' data-id='MT26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_14' data-id='MT26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then one of the Twelve—the one called Judas Iscariot—went to the chief priests </span>
<span class='v MT26_15' data-id='MT26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?” So they counted out for him thirty pieces of silver. </span>
<span class='v MT26_16' data-id='MT26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>From then on Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Last Supper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_17' data-id='MT26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_18' data-id='MT26_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My appointed time is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.’ ”</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_19' data-id='MT26_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_20' data-id='MT26_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve. </span>
<span class='v MT26_21' data-id='MT26_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And while they were eating, he said, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_22' data-id='MT26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They were very sad and began to say to him one after the other, “Surely you don’t mean me, Lord?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_23' data-id='MT26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_24' data-id='MT26_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_25' data-id='MT26_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, “Surely you don’t mean me, Rabbi?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_25' data-id='MT26_25'>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“You have said so.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_26' data-id='MT26_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, <span class='wj'>“Take and eat; this is my body.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_27' data-id='MT26_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, <span class='wj'>“Drink from it, all of you.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_28' data-id='MT26_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is my blood of the</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2539'><a href='#note-2539' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_30' data-id='MT26_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Predicts Peter’s Denial </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_31' data-id='MT26_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them, <span class='wj'>“This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT26_31' data-id='MT26_31'><span class='wj'>“ ‘I will strike the shepherd, </span></span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT26_32' data-id='MT26_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_33' data-id='MT26_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Peter replied, “Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_34' data-id='MT26_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_35' data-id='MT26_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But Peter declared, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the other disciples said the same. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Gethsemane </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_36' data-id='MT26_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_37' data-id='MT26_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled. </span>
<span class='v MT26_38' data-id='MT26_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_39' data-id='MT26_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, <span class='wj'>“My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_40' data-id='MT26_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. <span class='wj'>“Couldn’t you men keep watch with me for one hour?”</span> he asked Peter. </span>
<span class='v MT26_41' data-id='MT26_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_42' data-id='MT26_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>He went away a second time and prayed, <span class='wj'>“My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_43' data-id='MT26_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. </span>
<span class='v MT26_44' data-id='MT26_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_45' data-id='MT26_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_46' data-id='MT26_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Rise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Arrested </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_47' data-id='MT26_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people. </span>
<span class='v MT26_48' data-id='MT26_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.” </span>
<span class='v MT26_49' data-id='MT26_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_50' data-id='MT26_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Do what you came for, friend.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2541'><a href='#note-2541' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_50' data-id='MT26_50'>Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. </span>
<span class='v MT26_51' data-id='MT26_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>With that, one of Jesus’ companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_52' data-id='MT26_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Put your sword back in its place,”</span> Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</span></span>

<span class='v MT26_54' data-id='MT26_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_55' data-id='MT26_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>In that hour Jesus said to the crowd, <span class='wj'>“Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</span></span>
<span class='v MT26_56' data-id='MT26_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”</span> Then all the disciples deserted him and fled. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Before the Sanhedrin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_57' data-id='MT26_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled. </span>
<span class='v MT26_58' data-id='MT26_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_59' data-id='MT26_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death. </span>
<span class='v MT26_60' data-id='MT26_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_60' data-id='MT26_60'>Finally two came forward </span>
<span class='v MT26_61' data-id='MT26_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>and declared, “This fellow said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_62' data-id='MT26_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?” </span>
<span class='v MT26_63' data-id='MT26_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>But Jesus remained silent. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_63' data-id='MT26_63'>The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_64' data-id='MT26_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You have said so,”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2542'><a href='#note-2542' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_65' data-id='MT26_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy. </span>
<span class='v MT26_66' data-id='MT26_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>What do you think?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_66' data-id='MT26_66'>“He is worthy of death,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_67' data-id='MT26_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him </span>
<span class='v MT26_68' data-id='MT26_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah. Who hit you?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Disowns Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_69' data-id='MT26_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span>Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. “You also were with Jesus of Galilee,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_70' data-id='MT26_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>But he denied it before them all. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_71' data-id='MT26_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&nbsp;</span>Then he went out to the gateway, where another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_72' data-id='MT26_72'><span class='v-num v-72'>72&nbsp;</span>He denied it again, with an oath: “I don’t know the man!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_73' data-id='MT26_73'><span class='v-num v-73'>73&nbsp;</span>After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_74' data-id='MT26_74'><span class='v-num v-74'>74&nbsp;</span>Then he began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I don’t know the man!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT26_74' data-id='MT26_74'>Immediately a rooster crowed. </span>
<span class='v MT26_75' data-id='MT26_75'><span class='v-num v-75'>75&nbsp;</span>Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: <span class='wj'>“Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.”</span> And he went outside and wept bitterly. </span></div></div>
