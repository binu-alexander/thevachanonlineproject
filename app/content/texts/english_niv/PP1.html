<span class='v PP1_4' data-id='PP1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy </span>
<span class='v PP1_5' data-id='PP1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, </span>
<span class='v PP1_6' data-id='PP1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_7' data-id='PP1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart and, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God’s grace with me. </span>
<span class='v PP1_8' data-id='PP1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>God can testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. </span></div>

<div class='s'>Paul’s Chains Advance the Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_12' data-id='PP1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters,<span class='note' id='footnote-3085'><a href='#note-3085' class='key'>†</a></span> that what has happened to me has actually served to advance the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP1_13' data-id='PP1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard<span class='note' id='footnote-3086'><a href='#note-3086' class='key'>‡</a></span> and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP1_14' data-id='PP1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the gospel without fear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_15' data-id='PP1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. </span>
<span class='v PP1_16' data-id='PP1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP1_17' data-id='PP1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. </span>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'>Yes, and I will continue to rejoice, </span>
<span class='v PP1_19' data-id='PP1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>for I know that through your prayers and God’s provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.<span class='note' id='footnote-3087'><a href='#note-3087' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v PP1_20' data-id='PP1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death. </span>
<span class='v PP1_21' data-id='PP1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. </span>
<span class='v PP1_22' data-id='PP1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If I am to go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know! </span>
<span class='v PP1_23' data-id='PP1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I am torn between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far; </span>
<span class='v PP1_24' data-id='PP1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body. </span>
<span class='v PP1_25' data-id='PP1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain, and I will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith, </span>
<span class='v PP1_26' data-id='PP1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>so that through my being with you again your boasting in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Life Worthy of the Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_27' data-id='PP1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit,<span class='note' id='footnote-3088'><a href='#note-3088' class='key'>*</a></span> striving together as one for the faith of the gospel </span>
<span class='v PP1_28' data-id='PP1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will be destroyed, but that you will be saved—and that by God. </span>
<span class='v PP1_29' data-id='PP1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him, </span>
<span class='v PP1_30' data-id='PP1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>since you are going through the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have. </span></div></div>
