<div class='s'>Jesus Anointed at Bethany </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_1' data-id='JN12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_2' data-id='JN12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Here a dinner was given in Jesus’ honor. Martha served, while Lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_3' data-id='JN12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Mary took about a pint<span class='note' id='footnote-2745'><a href='#note-2745' class='key'>*</a></span> of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus’ feet and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_4' data-id='JN12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, objected, </span>
<span class='v JN12_5' data-id='JN12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Why wasn’t this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth a year’s wages.<span class='note' id='footnote-2746'><a href='#note-2746' class='key'>†</a></span>” </span>
<span class='v JN12_6' data-id='JN12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_7' data-id='JN12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Leave her alone,”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“It was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial.</span></span>
<span class='v JN12_8' data-id='JN12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You will always have the poor among you, </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2747'><a href='#note-2747' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>but you will not always have me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_9' data-id='JN12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_10' data-id='JN12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well, </span>
<span class='v JN12_11' data-id='JN12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and believing in him. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_12' data-id='JN12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JN12_13' data-id='JN12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_16' data-id='JN12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that these things had been done to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_17' data-id='JN12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word. </span>
<span class='v JN12_18' data-id='JN12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Many people, because they had heard that he had performed this sign, went out to meet him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_19' data-id='JN12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_20' data-id='JN12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the festival. </span>
<span class='v JN12_21' data-id='JN12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,” they said, “we would like to see Jesus.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_22' data-id='JN12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_23' data-id='JN12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_28' data-id='JN12_28'>Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and will glorify it again.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_29' data-id='JN12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_30' data-id='JN12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“This voice was for your benefit, not mine.</span></span>

<span class='v JN12_33' data-id='JN12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He said this to show the kind of death he was going to die. </span></div>

<span class='v JN12_34' data-id='JN12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The crowd spoke up, “We have heard from the Law that the Messiah will remain forever, so how can you say, <span class='wj'>‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’</span>? Who is this ‘Son of Man’?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_35' data-id='JN12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them, <span class='wj'>“You are going to have the light just a little while longer.

<span class='v JN12_37' data-id='JN12_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_38' data-id='JN12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_39' data-id='JN12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere: </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN12_41' data-id='JN12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_42' data-id='JN12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; </span>
<span class='v JN12_43' data-id='JN12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>for they loved human praise more than praise from God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_44' data-id='JN12_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus cried out, <span class='wj'>“Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me.</span></span>
