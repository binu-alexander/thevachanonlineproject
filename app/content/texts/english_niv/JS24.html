<div class='s'>The Covenant Renewed at Shechem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_1' data-id='JS24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_2' data-id='JS24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Long ago your ancestors, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. </span>
<span class='v JS24_3' data-id='JS24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, </span>
<span class='v JS24_4' data-id='JS24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his family went down to Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_5' data-id='JS24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted the Egyptians by what I did there, and I brought you out. </span>
<span class='v JS24_6' data-id='JS24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When I brought your people out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen<span class='note' id='footnote-593'><a href='#note-593' class='key'>*</a></span> as far as the Red Sea.<span class='note' id='footnote-594'><a href='#note-594' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v JS24_7' data-id='JS24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But they cried to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for help, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians; he brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_8' data-id='JS24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“ ‘I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. I destroyed them from before you, and you took possession of their land. </span>
<span class='v JS24_9' data-id='JS24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When Balak son of Zippor, the king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel, he sent for Balaam son of Beor to put a curse on you. </span>
<span class='v JS24_10' data-id='JS24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_11' data-id='JS24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did also the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands. </span>
<span class='v JS24_12' data-id='JS24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow. </span>
<span class='v JS24_13' data-id='JS24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So I gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build; and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_14' data-id='JS24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Now fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and serve him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshiped beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt, and serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JS24_15' data-id='JS24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if serving the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_16' data-id='JS24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to serve other gods! </span>
<span class='v JS24_17' data-id='JS24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>It was the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled. </span>
<span class='v JS24_18' data-id='JS24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, because he is our God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_19' data-id='JS24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. He is a holy God; he is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins. </span>
<span class='v JS24_20' data-id='JS24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>If you forsake the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and serve foreign gods, he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after he has been good to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_21' data-id='JS24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_22' data-id='JS24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_22' data-id='JS24_22'>“Yes, we are witnesses,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_23' data-id='JS24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_24' data-id='JS24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God and obey him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_25' data-id='JS24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws. </span>
<span class='v JS24_26' data-id='JS24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_27' data-id='JS24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“See!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has said to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_28' data-id='JS24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Buried in the Promised Land </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_29' data-id='JS24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, died at the age of a hundred and ten. </span>
<span class='v JS24_30' data-id='JS24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah<span class='note' id='footnote-595'><a href='#note-595' class='key'>‡</a></span> in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_31' data-id='JS24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Israel served the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had done for Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_32' data-id='JS24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the tract of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver<span class='note' id='footnote-596'><a href='#note-596' class='key'>§</a></span> from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS24_33' data-id='JS24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been allotted to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim. </span></div></div>
