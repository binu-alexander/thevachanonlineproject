<div class='s'>The Parable of the Tenants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_1' data-id='MK12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus then began to speak to them in parables: <span class='wj'>“A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and moved to another place.</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_2' data-id='MK12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_3' data-id='MK12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But they seized him, beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_4' data-id='MK12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Then he sent another servant to them; they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully.</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_5' data-id='MK12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He sent still another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some of them they beat, others they killed.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_6' data-id='MK12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“He had one left to send, a son, whom he loved. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_7' data-id='MK12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span></span>
<span class='v MK12_8' data-id='MK12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_9' data-id='MK12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_10' data-id='MK12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Haven’t you read this passage of Scripture: </span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_12' data-id='MK12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them.

<div class='s'>Paying the Imperial Tax to Caesar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_13' data-id='MK12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to catch him in his words. </span>
<span class='v MK12_14' data-id='MK12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity. You aren’t swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are; but you teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax<span class='note' id='footnote-2596'><a href='#note-2596' class='key'>†</a></span> to Caesar or not? </span>
<span class='v MK12_15' data-id='MK12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_15' data-id='MK12_15'>But Jesus knew their hypocrisy. <span class='wj'>“Why are you trying to trap me?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK12_16' data-id='MK12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They brought the coin, and he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Whose image is this? And whose inscription?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_16' data-id='MK12_16'>“Caesar’s,” they replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_17' data-id='MK12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s and to God what is God’s.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_17' data-id='MK12_17'>And they were amazed at him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Marriage at the Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_18' data-id='MK12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. </span>
<span class='v MK12_19' data-id='MK12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class='v MK12_20' data-id='MK12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children. </span>
<span class='v MK12_21' data-id='MK12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. It was the same with the third. </span>
<span class='v MK12_22' data-id='MK12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In fact, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_24' data-id='MK12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Are you not in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?</span></span>

<span class='v MK12_26' data-id='MK12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Now about the dead rising—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2598'><a href='#note-2598' class='key'>§</a></span><span class='wj'>?</span></span>

<div class='s'>The Greatest Commandment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_28' data-id='MK12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_29' data-id='MK12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The most important one,”</span> answered Jesus, <span class='wj'>“is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2599'><a href='#note-2599' class='key'>*</a></span></span>

<span class='v MK12_31' data-id='MK12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2601'><a href='#note-2601' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>There is no commandment greater than these.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_32' data-id='MK12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. </span>
<span class='v MK12_33' data-id='MK12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_34' data-id='MK12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</span> And from then on no one dared ask him any more questions. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_35' data-id='MK12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he asked, <span class='wj'>“Why do the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK12_38' data-id='MK12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>As he taught, Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces, </span></span>

<span class='v MK12_41' data-id='MK12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. </span>
<span class='v MK12_42' data-id='MK12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents. </span></div>
