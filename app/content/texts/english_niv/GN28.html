<span class='v GN28_1' data-id='GN28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him. Then he commanded him: “Do not marry a Canaanite woman. </span>
<span class='v GN28_2' data-id='GN28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Go at once to Paddan Aram,<span class='note' id='footnote-119'><a href='#note-119' class='key'>*</a></span> to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel. Take a wife for yourself there, from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. </span>
<span class='v GN28_3' data-id='GN28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>May God Almighty<span class='note' id='footnote-120'><a href='#note-120' class='key'>†</a></span> bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples. </span>
<span class='v GN28_4' data-id='GN28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.” </span>
<span class='v GN28_5' data-id='GN28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac sent Jacob on his way, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, who was the mother of Jacob and Esau. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN28_6' data-id='GN28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife from there, and that when he blessed him he commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,” </span>
<span class='v GN28_7' data-id='GN28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram. </span>
<span class='v GN28_8' data-id='GN28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Esau then realized how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac; </span>
<span class='v GN28_9' data-id='GN28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael son of Abraham, in addition to the wives he already had. </span></div>

<span class='v GN28_10' data-id='GN28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran. </span>
<span class='v GN28_11' data-id='GN28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When he reached a certain place, he stopped for the night because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones there, he put it under his head and lay down to sleep. </span>
<span class='v GN28_12' data-id='GN28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. </span>
<span class='v GN28_13' data-id='GN28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>There above it<span class='note' id='footnote-121'><a href='#note-121' class='key'>‡</a></span> stood the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he said: “I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying. </span>
<span class='v GN28_14' data-id='GN28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south.

<span class='v GN28_15' data-id='GN28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN28_16' data-id='GN28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he thought, “Surely the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is in this place, and I was not aware of it.” </span>
<span class='v GN28_17' data-id='GN28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He was afraid and said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN28_18' data-id='GN28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning Jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. </span>
<span class='v GN28_19' data-id='GN28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He called that place Bethel,<span class='note' id='footnote-123'><a href='#note-123' class='key'>*</a></span> though the city used to be called Luz. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN28_20' data-id='GN28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and will watch over me on this journey I am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear </span>
<span class='v GN28_21' data-id='GN28_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>so that I return safely to my father’s household, then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span><span class='note' id='footnote-124'><a href='#note-124' class='key'>†</a></span> will be my God </span>
