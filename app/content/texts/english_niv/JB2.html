<span class='v JB2_1' data-id='JB2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On another day the angels<span class='note' id='footnote-1320'><a href='#note-1320' class='key'>*</a></span> came to present themselves before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and Satan also came with them to present himself before him. </span>
<span class='v JB2_2' data-id='JB2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_2' data-id='JB2_2'>Satan answered the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_3' data-id='JB2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_4' data-id='JB2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. </span>
<span class='v JB2_5' data-id='JB2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones, and he will surely curse you to your face.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_6' data-id='JB2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Very well, then, he is in your hands; but you must spare his life.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_7' data-id='JB2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So Satan went out from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. </span>
<span class='v JB2_8' data-id='JB2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_9' data-id='JB2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>His wife said to him, “Are you still maintaining your integrity? Curse God and die!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_10' data-id='JB2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He replied, “You are talking like a foolish<span class='note' id='footnote-1321'><a href='#note-1321' class='key'>†</a></span> woman. Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_10' data-id='JB2_10'>In all this, Job did not sin in what he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB2_11' data-id='JB2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him. </span>
<span class='v JB2_12' data-id='JB2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognize him; they began to weep aloud, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads. </span>
<span class='v JB2_13' data-id='JB2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was. </span></div></div>
