<div class='s'>Hezekiah Purifies the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_1' data-id='R229_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. </span>
<span class='v R229_2' data-id='R229_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did what was right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, just as his father David had done. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_3' data-id='R229_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In the first month of the first year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and repaired them. </span>
<span class='v R229_4' data-id='R229_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He brought in the priests and the Levites, assembled them in the square on the east side </span>
<span class='v R229_5' data-id='R229_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and said: “Listen to me, Levites! Consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors. Remove all defilement from the sanctuary. </span>
<span class='v R229_6' data-id='R229_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Our parents were unfaithful; they did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God and forsook him. They turned their faces away from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s dwelling place and turned their backs on him. </span>
<span class='v R229_7' data-id='R229_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps. They did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R229_8' data-id='R229_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore, the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has fallen on Judah and Jerusalem; he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn, as you can see with your own eyes. </span>
<span class='v R229_9' data-id='R229_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity. </span>
<span class='v R229_10' data-id='R229_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now I intend to make a covenant with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us. </span>
<span class='v R229_11' data-id='R229_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My sons, do not be negligent now, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has chosen you to stand before him and serve him, to minister before him and to burn incense.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_12' data-id='R229_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then these Levites set to work: </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_15' data-id='R229_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When they had assembled their fellow Levites and consecrated themselves, they went in to purify the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, as the king had ordered, following the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R229_16' data-id='R229_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The priests went into the sanctuary of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to purify it. They brought out to the courtyard of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. The Levites took it and carried it out to the Kidron Valley. </span>
<span class='v R229_17' data-id='R229_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. For eight more days they consecrated the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> itself, finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_18' data-id='R229_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and reported: “We have purified the entire temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table for setting out the consecrated bread, with all its articles. </span>
<span class='v R229_19' data-id='R229_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We have prepared and consecrated all the articles that King Ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king. They are now in front of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s altar.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_20' data-id='R229_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R229_21' data-id='R229_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering<span class='note' id='footnote-1217'><a href='#note-1217' class='key'>*</a></span> for the kingdom, for the sanctuary and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these on the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R229_22' data-id='R229_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the blood and splashed it against the altar; next they slaughtered the rams and splashed their blood against the altar; then they slaughtered the lambs and splashed their blood against the altar. </span>
<span class='v R229_23' data-id='R229_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them. </span>
<span class='v R229_24' data-id='R229_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_25' data-id='R229_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He stationed the Levites in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with cymbals, harps and lyres in the way prescribed by David and Gad the king’s seer and Nathan the prophet; this was commanded by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> through his prophets. </span>
<span class='v R229_26' data-id='R229_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments, and the priests with their trumpets. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_27' data-id='R229_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. As the offering began, singing to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> began also, accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of David king of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R229_28' data-id='R229_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly bowed in worship, while the musicians played and the trumpets sounded. All this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_29' data-id='R229_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>When the offerings were finished, the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped. </span>
<span class='v R229_30' data-id='R229_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to praise the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with the words of David and of Asaph the seer. So they sang praises with gladness and bowed down and worshiped. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_31' data-id='R229_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then Hezekiah said, “You have now dedicated yourselves to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. Come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” So the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_32' data-id='R229_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs—all of them for burnt offerings to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R229_33' data-id='R229_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats. </span>
<span class='v R229_34' data-id='R229_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The priests, however, were too few to skin all the burnt offerings; so their relatives the Levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated, for the Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been. </span>
<span class='v R229_35' data-id='R229_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>There were burnt offerings in abundance, together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R229_35' data-id='R229_35'>So the service of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was reestablished. </span>
<span class='v R229_36' data-id='R229_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what God had brought about for his people, because it was done so quickly. </span></div></div>
