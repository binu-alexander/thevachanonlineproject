<div class='s'>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_1' data-id='MT12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them. </span>
<span class='v MT12_2' data-id='MT12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_3' data-id='MT12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class='wj'>“Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_4' data-id='MT12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread—which was not lawful for them to do, but only for the priests.</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_5' data-id='MT12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Or haven’t you read in the Law that the priests on Sabbath duty in the temple desecrate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_6' data-id='MT12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_7' data-id='MT12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If you had known what these words mean, ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2483'><a href='#note-2483' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>you would not have condemned the innocent.</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_8' data-id='MT12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_9' data-id='MT12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, </span>
<span class='v MT12_10' data-id='MT12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to bring charges against Jesus, they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_11' data-id='MT12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out?</span></span>
<span class='v MT12_12' data-id='MT12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_13' data-id='MT12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other. </span>
<span class='v MT12_14' data-id='MT12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus. </span></div>

<span class='v MT12_22' data-id='MT12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then they brought him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute, and Jesus healed him, so that he could both talk and see. </span>
<span class='v MT12_23' data-id='MT12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>All the people were astonished and said, “Could this be the Son of David?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_25' data-id='MT12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus knew their thoughts and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</span></span>
