<div class='s'>The False Prophet Hananiah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_1' data-id='JR28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the fifth month of that same year, the fourth year, early in the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, who was from Gibeon, said to me in the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the presence of the priests and all the people: </span>
<span class='v JR28_2' data-id='JR28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR28_3' data-id='JR28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Within two years I will bring back to this place all the articles of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon removed from here and took to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR28_4' data-id='JR28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will also bring back to this place Jehoiachin<span class='note' id='footnote-1965'><a href='#note-1965' class='key'>*</a></span> son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other exiles from Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_5' data-id='JR28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JR28_6' data-id='JR28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said, “Amen! May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> do so! May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s house and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR28_7' data-id='JR28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, listen to what I have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people: </span>
<span class='v JR28_8' data-id='JR28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>From early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war, disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms. </span>
<span class='v JR28_9' data-id='JR28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> only if his prediction comes true.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_10' data-id='JR28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it, </span>
<span class='v JR28_11' data-id='JR28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and he said before all the people, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘In the same way I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years.’ ” At this, the prophet Jeremiah went on his way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_12' data-id='JR28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah: </span>
<span class='v JR28_13' data-id='JR28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will get a yoke of iron. </span>
<span class='v JR28_14' data-id='JR28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_15' data-id='JR28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not sent you, yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies. </span>
<span class='v JR28_16' data-id='JR28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This very year you are going to die, because you have preached rebellion against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR28_17' data-id='JR28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In the seventh month of that same year, Hananiah the prophet died. </span></div></div>
