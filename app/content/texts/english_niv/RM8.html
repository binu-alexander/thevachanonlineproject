<div class='s'>Life Through the Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_1' data-id='RM8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v RM8_2' data-id='RM8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit who gives life has set you<span class='note' id='footnote-2886'><a href='#note-2886' class='key'>*</a></span> free from the law of sin and death. </span>
<span class='v RM8_3' data-id='RM8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For what the law was powerless to do because it was weakened by the flesh,<span class='note' id='footnote-2887'><a href='#note-2887' class='key'>†</a></span> God did by sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering.<span class='note' id='footnote-2888'><a href='#note-2888' class='key'>‡</a></span> And so he condemned sin in the flesh, </span>
<span class='v RM8_4' data-id='RM8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_5' data-id='RM8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on what the flesh desires; but those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires. </span>
<span class='v RM8_6' data-id='RM8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace. </span>
<span class='v RM8_7' data-id='RM8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The mind governed by the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God’s law, nor can it do so. </span>
<span class='v RM8_8' data-id='RM8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Those who are in the realm of the flesh cannot please God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_9' data-id='RM8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You, however, are not in the realm of the flesh but are in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Christ. </span>
<span class='v RM8_10' data-id='RM8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But if Christ is in you, then even though your body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit gives life<span class='note' id='footnote-2889'><a href='#note-2889' class='key'>§</a></span> because of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM8_11' data-id='RM8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of<span class='note' id='footnote-2890'><a href='#note-2890' class='key'>*</a></span> his Spirit who lives in you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_12' data-id='RM8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it. </span>
<span class='v RM8_13' data-id='RM8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_14' data-id='RM8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For those who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God. </span>
<span class='v RM8_15' data-id='RM8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Spirit you received does not make you slaves, so that you live in fear again; rather, the Spirit you received brought about your adoption to sonship.<span class='note' id='footnote-2891'><a href='#note-2891' class='key'>†</a></span> And by him we cry, <span class='tl'>“Abba,</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2892'><a href='#note-2892' class='key'>‡</a></span> Father.” </span>
<span class='v RM8_16' data-id='RM8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children. </span>
<span class='v RM8_17' data-id='RM8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Present Suffering and Future Glory </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_18' data-id='RM8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us. </span>
<span class='v RM8_19' data-id='RM8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For the creation waits in eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed. </span>
<span class='v RM8_20' data-id='RM8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope </span>
<span class='v RM8_21' data-id='RM8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>that<span class='note' id='footnote-2893'><a href='#note-2893' class='key'>§</a></span> the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_22' data-id='RM8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. </span>
<span class='v RM8_23' data-id='RM8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies. </span>
<span class='v RM8_24' data-id='RM8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have? </span>
<span class='v RM8_25' data-id='RM8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_26' data-id='RM8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. </span>
<span class='v RM8_27' data-id='RM8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_28' data-id='RM8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who<span class='note' id='footnote-2894'><a href='#note-2894' class='key'>*</a></span> have been called according to his purpose. </span>
<span class='v RM8_29' data-id='RM8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. </span>
<span class='v RM8_30' data-id='RM8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>More Than Conquerors </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM8_31' data-id='RM8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? </span>
<span class='v RM8_32' data-id='RM8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? </span>
<span class='v RM8_33' data-id='RM8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. </span>
<span class='v RM8_34' data-id='RM8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. </span>
<span class='v RM8_35' data-id='RM8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? </span>
<span class='v RM8_36' data-id='RM8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>As it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM8_36' data-id='RM8_36'>“For your sake we face death all day long; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM8_37' data-id='RM8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. </span>
<span class='v RM8_38' data-id='RM8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,<span class='note' id='footnote-2896'><a href='#note-2896' class='key'>‡</a></span> neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, </span>
<span class='v RM8_39' data-id='RM8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div></div>
