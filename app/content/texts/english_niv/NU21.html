<div class='s'>Arad Destroyed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_1' data-id='NU21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked the Israelites and captured some of them. </span>
<span class='v NU21_2' data-id='NU21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Israel made this vow to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: “If you will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy<span class='note' id='footnote-462'><a href='#note-462' class='key'>*</a></span> their cities.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_3' data-id='NU21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns; so the place was named Hormah.<span class='note' id='footnote-463'><a href='#note-463' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Bronze Snake </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_4' data-id='NU21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea,<span class='note' id='footnote-464'><a href='#note-464' class='key'>‡</a></span> to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way; </span>
<span class='v NU21_5' data-id='NU21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>they spoke against God and against Moses, and said, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_6' data-id='NU21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people and many Israelites died. </span>
<span class='v NU21_7' data-id='NU21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and against you. Pray that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will take the snakes away from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_8' data-id='NU21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_9' data-id='NU21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Journey to Moab </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_10' data-id='NU21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth. </span>
<span class='v NU21_11' data-id='NU21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then they set out from Oboth and camped in Iye Abarim, in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise. </span>
<span class='v NU21_12' data-id='NU21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley. </span>
<span class='v NU21_13' data-id='NU21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. </span>
<span class='v NU21_14' data-id='NU21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>That is why the Book of the Wars of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v NU21_16' data-id='NU21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_17' data-id='NU21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sang this song: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_17' data-id='NU21_17'>“Spring up, O well! </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_17' data-id='NU21_17'>Sing about it, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>about the well that the princes dug, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>that the nobles of the people sank— </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>the nobles with scepters and staffs.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah, </span>
<span class='v NU21_19' data-id='NU21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, </span>
<span class='v NU21_20' data-id='NU21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Defeat of Sihon and Og </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_21' data-id='NU21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_22' data-id='NU21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_23' data-id='NU21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He mustered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness against Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU21_24' data-id='NU21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, but only as far as the Ammonites, because their border was fortified. </span>
<span class='v NU21_25' data-id='NU21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements. </span>
<span class='v NU21_26' data-id='NU21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the Arnon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_27' data-id='NU21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>That is why the poets say: </span></div>

<div class='q2'>

<span class='v NU21_28' data-id='NU21_28'>It consumed Ar of Moab, </span></div>

<span class='v NU21_30' data-id='NU21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“But we have overthrown them; </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_31' data-id='NU21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_32' data-id='NU21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>After Moses had sent spies to Jazer, the Israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there. </span>
<span class='v NU21_33' data-id='NU21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at Edrei. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_34' data-id='NU21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_35' data-id='NU21_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So they struck him down, together with his sons and his whole army, leaving them no survivors. And they took possession of his land. </span></div></div>
