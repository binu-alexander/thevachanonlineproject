<span class='v H13_1' data-id='H13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So when we could stand it no longer, we thought it best to be left by ourselves in Athens. </span>
<span class='v H13_2' data-id='H13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We sent Timothy, who is our brother and co-worker in God’s service in spreading the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith, </span>
<span class='v H13_3' data-id='H13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>so that no one would be unsettled by these trials. For you know quite well that we are destined for them. </span>
<span class='v H13_4' data-id='H13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In fact, when we were with you, we kept telling you that we would be persecuted. And it turned out that way, as you well know. </span>
<span class='v H13_5' data-id='H13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this reason, when I could stand it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith. I was afraid that in some way the tempter had tempted you and that our labors might have been in vain. </span></div>

<span class='v H13_6' data-id='H13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love.

<span class='v H13_7' data-id='H13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith. </span>
<span class='v H13_8' data-id='H13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For now we really live, since you are standing firm in the Lord. </span>
