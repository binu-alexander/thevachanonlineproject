<div class='s'>Cities of Refuge </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_1' data-id='DT19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you, and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses, </span>
<span class='v DT19_2' data-id='DT19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>then set aside for yourselves three cities in the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess. </span>
<span class='v DT19_3' data-id='DT19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Determine the distances involved and divide into three parts the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that a person who kills someone may flee for refuge to one of these cities. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_4' data-id='DT19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This is the rule concerning anyone who kills a person and flees there for safety—anyone who kills a neighbor unintentionally, without malice aforethought. </span>
<span class='v DT19_5' data-id='DT19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For instance, a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and as he swings his ax to fell a tree, the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him. That man may flee to one of these cities and save his life. </span>
<span class='v DT19_6' data-id='DT19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage, overtake him if the distance is too great, and kill him even though he is not deserving of death, since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought. </span>
<span class='v DT19_7' data-id='DT19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is why I command you to set aside for yourselves three cities. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_8' data-id='DT19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God enlarges your territory, as he promised on oath to your ancestors, and gives you the whole land he promised them, </span>
<span class='v DT19_9' data-id='DT19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>because you carefully follow all these laws I command you today—to love the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and to walk always in obedience to him—then you are to set aside three more cities. </span>
<span class='v DT19_10' data-id='DT19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you as your inheritance, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_11' data-id='DT19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But if out of hate someone lies in wait, assaults and kills a neighbor, and then flees to one of these cities, </span>
<span class='v DT19_12' data-id='DT19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>the killer shall be sent for by the town elders, be brought back from the city, and be handed over to the avenger of blood to die. </span>
<span class='v DT19_13' data-id='DT19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_14' data-id='DT19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do not move your neighbor’s boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Witnesses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_15' data-id='DT19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>One witness is not enough to convict anyone accused of any crime or offense they may have committed. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_16' data-id='DT19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse someone of a crime, </span>
<span class='v DT19_17' data-id='DT19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>the two people involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time. </span>
<span class='v DT19_18' data-id='DT19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness proves to be a liar, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite, </span>
<span class='v DT19_19' data-id='DT19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>then do to the false witness as that witness intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you. </span>
<span class='v DT19_20' data-id='DT19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you. </span>
<span class='v DT19_21' data-id='DT19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. </span></div></div>
