<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_3' data-id='NU13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So at the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites. </span>

<div class='li'>
<span class='v NU13_15' data-id='NU13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_16' data-id='NU13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_17' data-id='NU13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country. </span>
<span class='v NU13_18' data-id='NU13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. </span>
<span class='v NU13_19' data-id='NU13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? </span>
<span class='v NU13_20' data-id='NU13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees in it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_21' data-id='NU13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. </span>
<span class='v NU13_22' data-id='NU13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) </span>
<span class='v NU13_23' data-id='NU13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When they reached the Valley of Eshkol,<span class='note' id='footnote-446'><a href='#note-446' class='key'>*</a></span> they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs. </span>
<span class='v NU13_24' data-id='NU13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>That place was called the Valley of Eshkol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. </span>
<span class='v NU13_25' data-id='NU13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Report on the Exploration </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_26' data-id='NU13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. </span>
<span class='v NU13_27' data-id='NU13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They gave Moses this account: “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. </span>
<span class='v NU13_28' data-id='NU13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. </span>
<span class='v NU13_29' data-id='NU13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_30' data-id='NU13_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU13_31' data-id='NU13_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But the men who had gone up with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.” </span>
<span class='v NU13_32' data-id='NU13_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, “The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. </span>
<span class='v NU13_33' data-id='NU13_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.” </span></div></div>
