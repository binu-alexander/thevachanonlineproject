<div class='s'>David Spares Saul’s Life </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_1' data-id='S124_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” </span>
<span class='v S124_2' data-id='S124_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So Saul took three thousand able young men from all Israel and set out to look for David and his men near the Crags of the Wild Goats. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_3' data-id='S124_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He came to the sheep pens along the way; a cave was there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. David and his men were far back in the cave. </span>
<span class='v S124_4' data-id='S124_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The men said, “This is the day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoke of when he said<span class='note' id='footnote-737'><a href='#note-737' class='key'>*</a></span> to you, ‘I will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish.’ ” Then David crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_5' data-id='S124_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Afterward, David was conscience-stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe. </span>
<span class='v S124_6' data-id='S124_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to his men, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> forbid that I should do such a thing to my master, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed, or lay my hand on him; for he is the anointed of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span>
<span class='v S124_7' data-id='S124_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>With these words David sharply rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack Saul. And Saul left the cave and went his way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_8' data-id='S124_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then David went out of the cave and called out to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground. </span>
<span class='v S124_9' data-id='S124_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when men say, ‘David is bent on harming you’? </span>
<span class='v S124_10' data-id='S124_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This day you have seen with your own eyes how the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> delivered you into my hands in the cave. Some urged me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not lay my hand on my lord, because he is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed.’ </span>
<span class='v S124_11' data-id='S124_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>See, my father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you. See that there is nothing in my hand to indicate that I am guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion. I have not wronged you, but you are hunting me down to take my life. </span>
<span class='v S124_12' data-id='S124_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> judge between you and me. And may the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> avenge the wrongs you have done to me, but my hand will not touch you. </span>
<span class='v S124_13' data-id='S124_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As the old saying goes, ‘From evildoers come evil deeds,’ so my hand will not touch you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_14' data-id='S124_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Who are you pursuing? A dead dog? A flea? </span>
<span class='v S124_15' data-id='S124_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be our judge and decide between us. May he consider my cause and uphold it; may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_16' data-id='S124_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When David finished saying this, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he wept aloud. </span>
<span class='v S124_17' data-id='S124_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“You are more righteous than I,” he said. “You have treated me well, but I have treated you badly. </span>
<span class='v S124_18' data-id='S124_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>You have just now told me about the good you did to me; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> delivered me into your hands, but you did not kill me. </span>
<span class='v S124_19' data-id='S124_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When a man finds his enemy, does he let him get away unharmed? May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> reward you well for the way you treated me today. </span>
<span class='v S124_20' data-id='S124_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hands. </span>
<span class='v S124_21' data-id='S124_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Now swear to me by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that you will not kill off my descendants or wipe out my name from my father’s family.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S124_22' data-id='S124_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So David gave his oath to Saul. Then Saul returned home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold. </span></div></div>
