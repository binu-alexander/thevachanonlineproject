<span class='v MK11_5' data-id='MK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>some people standing there asked, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” </span>
<span class='v MK11_6' data-id='MK11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go. </span>
<span class='v MK11_7' data-id='MK11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, he sat on it. </span>

<span class='v MK11_12' data-id='MK11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The next day as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry. </span>
<span class='v MK11_13' data-id='MK11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to find out if it had any fruit. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, because it was not the season for figs. </span>
<span class='v MK11_14' data-id='MK11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the tree, <span class='wj'>“May no one ever eat fruit from you again.”</span> And his disciples heard him say it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_15' data-id='MK11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>On reaching Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began driving out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves, </span>
<span class='v MK11_16' data-id='MK11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. </span>
<span class='v MK11_17' data-id='MK11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And as he taught them, he said, <span class='wj'>“Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2590'><a href='#note-2590' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>?

<span class='v MK11_18' data-id='MK11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching. </span></div>

<span class='v MK11_20' data-id='MK11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. </span>
<span class='v MK11_21' data-id='MK11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_22' data-id='MK11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Have faith in God,”</span> Jesus answered. </span>

<span class='v MK11_27' data-id='MK11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They arrived again in Jerusalem, and while Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him. </span>
<span class='v MK11_28' data-id='MK11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“By what authority are you doing these things?” they asked. “And who gave you authority to do this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_29' data-id='MK11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span></span>

<span class='v MK11_31' data-id='MK11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v MK11_32' data-id='MK11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But if we say, ‘Of human origin’ …” (They feared the people, for everyone held that John really was a prophet.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_33' data-id='MK11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” </span></div>
