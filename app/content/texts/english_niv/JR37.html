<div class='s'>Jeremiah in Prison </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_1' data-id='JR37_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah son of Josiah was made king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; he reigned in place of Jehoiachin<span class='note' id='footnote-1986'><a href='#note-1986' class='key'>*</a></span> son of Jehoiakim. </span>
<span class='v JR37_2' data-id='JR37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had spoken through Jeremiah the prophet. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_3' data-id='JR37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>King Zedekiah, however, sent Jehukal son of Shelemiah with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to Jeremiah the prophet with this message: “Please pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God for us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_4' data-id='JR37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now Jeremiah was free to come and go among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison. </span>
<span class='v JR37_5' data-id='JR37_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh’s army had marched out of Egypt, and when the Babylonians<span class='note' id='footnote-1987'><a href='#note-1987' class='key'>†</a></span> who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_6' data-id='JR37_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet: </span>
<span class='v JR37_7' data-id='JR37_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Pharaoh’s army, which has marched out to support you, will go back to its own land, to Egypt. </span>
<span class='v JR37_8' data-id='JR37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the Babylonians will return and attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_9' data-id='JR37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, ‘The Babylonians will surely leave us.’ They will not! </span>
<span class='v JR37_10' data-id='JR37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian<span class='note' id='footnote-1988'><a href='#note-1988' class='key'>‡</a></span> army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents, they would come out and burn this city down.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_11' data-id='JR37_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>After the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, </span>
<span class='v JR37_12' data-id='JR37_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of Benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there. </span>
<span class='v JR37_13' data-id='JR37_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But when he reached the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, whose name was Irijah son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him and said, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_14' data-id='JR37_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“That’s not true!” Jeremiah said. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah would not listen to him; instead, he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials. </span>
<span class='v JR37_15' data-id='JR37_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They were angry with Jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary, which they had made into a prison. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_16' data-id='JR37_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained a long time. </span>
<span class='v JR37_17' data-id='JR37_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then King Zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace, where he asked him privately, “Is there any word from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_17' data-id='JR37_17'>“Yes,” Jeremiah replied, “you will be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_18' data-id='JR37_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I committed against you or your attendants or this people, that you have put me in prison? </span>
<span class='v JR37_19' data-id='JR37_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’? </span>
<span class='v JR37_20' data-id='JR37_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But now, my lord the king, please listen. Let me bring my petition before you: Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, or I will die there.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR37_21' data-id='JR37_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>King Zedekiah then gave orders for Jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given a loaf of bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard. </span></div></div>
