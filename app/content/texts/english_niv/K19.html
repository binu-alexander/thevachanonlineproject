<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Appears to Solomon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_1' data-id='K19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Solomon had finished building the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the royal palace, and had achieved all he had desired to do, </span>
<span class='v K19_2' data-id='K19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to him a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. </span>
<span class='v K19_3' data-id='K19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_3' data-id='K19_3'>“I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me; I have consecrated this temple, which you have built, by putting my Name there forever. My eyes and my heart will always be there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_4' data-id='K19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“As for you, if you walk before me faithfully with integrity of heart and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my decrees and laws, </span>
<span class='v K19_5' data-id='K19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father when I said, ‘You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’ </span></div>

<span class='v K19_7' data-id='K19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. </span>
<span class='v K19_8' data-id='K19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This temple will become a heap of rubble. All<span class='note' id='footnote-878'><a href='#note-878' class='key'>‡</a></span> who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say, ‘Why has the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> done such a thing to this land and to this temple?’ </span>
<span class='v K19_9' data-id='K19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> brought all this disaster on them.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon’s Other Activities </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_10' data-id='K19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>At the end of twenty years, during which Solomon built these two buildings—the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the royal palace— </span>
<span class='v K19_11' data-id='K19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and juniper and gold he wanted. </span>
<span class='v K19_12' data-id='K19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when Hiram went from Tyre to see the towns that Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. </span>
<span class='v K19_13' data-id='K19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“What kind of towns are these you have given me, my brother?” he asked. And he called them the Land of Kabul,<span class='note' id='footnote-879'><a href='#note-879' class='key'>§</a></span> a name they have to this day. </span>
<span class='v K19_14' data-id='K19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents<span class='note' id='footnote-880'><a href='#note-880' class='key'>*</a></span> of gold. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_15' data-id='K19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Here is the account of the forced labor King Solomon conscripted to build the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple, his own palace, the terraces,<span class='note' id='footnote-881'><a href='#note-881' class='key'>†</a></span> the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. </span>
<span class='v K19_16' data-id='K19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>(Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He had set it on fire. He killed its Canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. </span>
<span class='v K19_17' data-id='K19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Solomon rebuilt Gezer.) He built up Lower Beth Horon, </span>
<span class='v K19_18' data-id='K19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Baalath, and Tadmor<span class='note' id='footnote-882'><a href='#note-882' class='key'>‡</a></span> in the desert, within his land, </span>
<span class='v K19_19' data-id='K19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses<span class='note' id='footnote-883'><a href='#note-883' class='key'>§</a></span>—whatever he desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_20' data-id='K19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>There were still people left from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites (these peoples were not Israelites). </span>
<span class='v K19_21' data-id='K19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Solomon conscripted the descendants of all these peoples remaining in the land—whom the Israelites could not exterminate<span class='note' id='footnote-884'><a href='#note-884' class='key'>*</a></span>—to serve as slave labor, as it is to this day. </span>
<span class='v K19_22' data-id='K19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Solomon did not make slaves of any of the Israelites; they were his fighting men, his government officials, his officers, his captains, and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers. </span>
<span class='v K19_23' data-id='K19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They were also the chief officials in charge of Solomon’s projects—550 officials supervising those who did the work. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_24' data-id='K19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After Pharaoh’s daughter had come up from the City of David to the palace Solomon had built for her, he constructed the terraces. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_25' data-id='K19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Three times a year Solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, burning incense before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> along with them, and so fulfilled the temple obligations. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K19_26' data-id='K19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, which is near Elath in Edom, on the shore of the Red Sea.<span class='note' id='footnote-885'><a href='#note-885' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v K19_27' data-id='K19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Hiram sent his men—sailors who knew the sea—to serve in the fleet with Solomon’s men. </span>
<span class='v K19_28' data-id='K19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They sailed to Ophir and brought back 420 talents<span class='note' id='footnote-886'><a href='#note-886' class='key'>‡</a></span> of gold, which they delivered to King Solomon. </span></div></div>
