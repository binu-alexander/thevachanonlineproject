<span class='v JN6_1' data-id='JN6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Some time after this, Jesus crossed to the far shore of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias), </span>
<span class='v JN6_2' data-id='JN6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the signs he had performed by healing the sick. </span>
<span class='v JN6_3' data-id='JN6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN6_4' data-id='JN6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Jewish Passover Festival was near. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_5' data-id='JN6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, <span class='wj'>“Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?”</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_6' data-id='JN6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He asked this only to test him, for he already had in mind what he was going to do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_7' data-id='JN6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Philip answered him, “It would take more than half a year’s wages<span class='note' id='footnote-2727'><a href='#note-2727' class='key'>*</a></span> to buy enough bread for each one to have a bite!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_8' data-id='JN6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Another of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, spoke up, </span>
<span class='v JN6_9' data-id='JN6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish, but how far will they go among so many?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_10' data-id='JN6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Have the people sit down.”</span> There was plenty of grass in that place, and they sat down (about five thousand men were there). </span>
<span class='v JN6_11' data-id='JN6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus then took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted. He did the same with the fish. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_12' data-id='JN6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When they had all had enough to eat, he said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Gather the pieces that are left over. Let nothing be wasted.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_13' data-id='JN6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_14' data-id='JN6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>After the people saw the sign Jesus performed, they began to say, “Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.” </span>
<span class='v JN6_15' data-id='JN6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Walks on the Water </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_16' data-id='JN6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, </span>
<span class='v JN6_17' data-id='JN6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for Capernaum. By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. </span>
<span class='v JN6_18' data-id='JN6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. </span>
<span class='v JN6_19' data-id='JN6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When they had rowed about three or four miles,<span class='note' id='footnote-2728'><a href='#note-2728' class='key'>†</a></span> they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were frightened. </span>
<span class='v JN6_20' data-id='JN6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, <span class='wj'>“It is I; don’t be afraid.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_21' data-id='JN6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_22' data-id='JN6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with his disciples, but that they had gone away alone. </span>
<span class='v JN6_23' data-id='JN6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. </span>
<span class='v JN6_24' data-id='JN6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus the Bread of Life </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_25' data-id='JN6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When they found him on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_26' data-id='JN6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw the signs I performed but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_27' data-id='JN6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_28' data-id='JN6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_29' data-id='JN6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_30' data-id='JN6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So they asked him, “What sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do? </span>
<span class='v JN6_31' data-id='JN6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’<span class='note' id='footnote-2729'><a href='#note-2729' class='key'>‡</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_32' data-id='JN6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_33' data-id='JN6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For the bread of God is the bread that comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_34' data-id='JN6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” they said, “always give us this bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_35' data-id='JN6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus declared, <span class='wj'>“I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_36' data-id='JN6_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe.</span></span>

<span class='v JN6_38' data-id='JN6_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_39' data-id='JN6_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_40' data-id='JN6_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_41' data-id='JN6_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, <span class='wj'>“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_42' data-id='JN6_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, <span class='wj'>‘I came down from heaven’</span>?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_43' data-id='JN6_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Stop grumbling among yourselves,”</span> Jesus answered. </span>
<span class='v JN6_44' data-id='JN6_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_45' data-id='JN6_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2730'><a href='#note-2730' class='key'>§</a></span><span class='wj'>Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me.</span></span>

<span class='v JN6_47' data-id='JN6_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_48' data-id='JN6_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am the bread of life.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_49' data-id='JN6_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_50' data-id='JN6_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_51' data-id='JN6_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_52' data-id='JN6_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_53' data-id='JN6_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span></span>

<span class='v JN6_58' data-id='JN6_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN6_59' data-id='JN6_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Many Disciples Desert Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_60' data-id='JN6_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>On hearing it, many of his disciples said, “This is a hard teaching. Who can accept it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_61' data-id='JN6_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Aware that his disciples were grumbling about this, Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Does this offend you?</span></span>

<span class='v JN6_64' data-id='JN6_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet there are some of you who do not believe.”</span> For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him. </span>
<span class='v JN6_65' data-id='JN6_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>He went on to say, <span class='wj'>“This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has enabled them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_66' data-id='JN6_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>From this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him. </span></div>

<span class='v JN6_67' data-id='JN6_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You do not want to leave too, do you?”</span> Jesus asked the Twelve. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN6_68' data-id='JN6_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. </span>
