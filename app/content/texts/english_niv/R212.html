<span class='v R212_1' data-id='R212_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After Rehoboam’s position as king was established and he had become strong, he and all Israel<span class='note' id='footnote-1169'><a href='#note-1169' class='key'>*</a></span> with him abandoned the law of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R212_2' data-id='R212_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Because they had been unfaithful to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam. </span>
<span class='v R212_3' data-id='R212_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>With twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of Libyans, Sukkites and Cushites<span class='note' id='footnote-1170'><a href='#note-1170' class='key'>†</a></span> that came with him from Egypt, </span>
<span class='v R212_4' data-id='R212_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_5' data-id='R212_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the prophet Shemaiah came to Rehoboam and to the leaders of Judah who had assembled in Jerusalem for fear of Shishak, and he said to them, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says, ‘You have abandoned me; therefore, I now abandon you to Shishak.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_6' data-id='R212_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is just.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_7' data-id='R212_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> saw that they humbled themselves, this word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Shemaiah: “Since they have humbled themselves, I will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance. My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem through Shishak. </span>
<span class='v R212_8' data-id='R212_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They will, however, become subject to him, so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_9' data-id='R212_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, he carried off the treasures of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the treasures of the royal palace. He took everything, including the gold shields Solomon had made. </span>
<span class='v R212_10' data-id='R212_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace. </span>
<span class='v R212_11' data-id='R212_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Whenever the king went to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple, the guards went with him, bearing the shields, and afterward they returned them to the guardroom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_12' data-id='R212_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger turned from him, and he was not totally destroyed. Indeed, there was some good in Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_13' data-id='R212_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>King Rehoboam established himself firmly in Jerusalem and continued as king. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel in which to put his Name. His mother’s name was Naamah; she was an Ammonite. </span>
<span class='v R212_14' data-id='R212_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R212_15' data-id='R212_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As for the events of Rehoboam’s reign, from beginning to end, are they not written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer that deal with genealogies? There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam. </span>
<span class='v R212_16' data-id='R212_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son succeeded him as king. </span></div></div>
