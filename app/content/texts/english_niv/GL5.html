<div class='s'>Freedom in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_1' data-id='GL5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_2' data-id='GL5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you at all. </span>
<span class='v GL5_3' data-id='GL5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_4' data-id='GL5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace. </span>
<span class='v GL5_5' data-id='GL5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For through the Spirit we eagerly await by faith the righteousness for which we hope. </span>
<span class='v GL5_6' data-id='GL5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_7' data-id='GL5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You were running a good race. Who cut in on you to keep you from obeying the truth? </span>
<span class='v GL5_8' data-id='GL5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>That kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you. </span>
<span class='v GL5_9' data-id='GL5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough.” </span>
<span class='v GL5_10' data-id='GL5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view. The one who is throwing you into confusion, whoever that may be, will have to pay the penalty. </span>
<span class='v GL5_11' data-id='GL5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been abolished. </span>
<span class='v GL5_12' data-id='GL5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves! </span></div>
<div class='s'>Life by the Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_13' data-id='GL5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the flesh<span class='note' id='footnote-3060'><a href='#note-3060' class='key'>*</a></span>; rather, serve one another humbly in love. </span>
<span class='v GL5_14' data-id='GL5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3061'><a href='#note-3061' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL5_15' data-id='GL5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If you bite and devour each other, watch out or you will be destroyed by each other. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_16' data-id='GL5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. </span>
<span class='v GL5_17' data-id='GL5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever<span class='note' id='footnote-3062'><a href='#note-3062' class='key'>‡</a></span> you want. </span>
<span class='v GL5_18' data-id='GL5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_19' data-id='GL5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; </span>
<span class='v GL5_20' data-id='GL5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions </span>
<span class='v GL5_21' data-id='GL5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL5_22' data-id='GL5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span>
<span class='v GL5_23' data-id='GL5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_24' data-id='GL5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. </span>
<span class='v GL5_25' data-id='GL5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v GL5_26' data-id='GL5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying each other. </span></div></div>
