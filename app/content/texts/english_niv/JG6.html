<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_1' data-id='JG6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the Midianites. </span>
<span class='v JG6_2' data-id='JG6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Because the power of Midian was so oppressive, the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts, caves and strongholds. </span>
<span class='v JG6_3' data-id='JG6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country. </span>
<span class='v JG6_4' data-id='JG6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to Gaza and did not spare a living thing for Israel, neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys. </span>
<span class='v JG6_5' data-id='JG6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels; they invaded the land to ravage it. </span>
<span class='v JG6_6' data-id='JG6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Midian so impoverished the Israelites that they cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for help. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_7' data-id='JG6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the Israelites cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> because of Midian, </span>
<span class='v JG6_8' data-id='JG6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>he sent them a prophet, who said, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: I brought you up out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. </span>
<span class='v JG6_9' data-id='JG6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians. And I delivered you from the hand of all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land. </span>
<span class='v JG6_10' data-id='JG6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I said to you, ‘I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God; do not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you live.’ But you have not listened to me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_11' data-id='JG6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came and sat down under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the Midianites. </span>
<span class='v JG6_12' data-id='JG6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to Gideon, he said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is with you, mighty warrior.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_13' data-id='JG6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but if the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all his wonders that our ancestors told us about when they said, ‘Did not the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has abandoned us and given us into the hand of Midian.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_14' data-id='JG6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_15' data-id='JG6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Pardon me, my lord,” Gideon replied, “but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_16' data-id='JG6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered, “I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none alive.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_17' data-id='JG6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Gideon replied, “If now I have found favor in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you talking to me. </span>
<span class='v JG6_18' data-id='JG6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Please do not go away until I come back and bring my offering and set it before you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_18' data-id='JG6_18'>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “I will wait until you return.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_19' data-id='JG6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah<span class='note' id='footnote-617'><a href='#note-617' class='key'>*</a></span> of flour he made bread without yeast. Putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot, he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_20' data-id='JG6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so. </span>
<span class='v JG6_21' data-id='JG6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff that was in his hand. Fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. And the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> disappeared. </span>
<span class='v JG6_22' data-id='JG6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, he exclaimed, “Alas, Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>! I have seen the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> face to face!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_23' data-id='JG6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_24' data-id='JG6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Gideon built an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> there and called it The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Is Peace. To this day it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_25' data-id='JG6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>That same night the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Take the second bull from your father’s herd, the one seven years old.<span class='note' id='footnote-618'><a href='#note-618' class='key'>†</a></span> Tear down your father’s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole<span class='note' id='footnote-619'><a href='#note-619' class='key'>‡</a></span> beside it. </span>
<span class='v JG6_26' data-id='JG6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then build a proper kind of<span class='note' id='footnote-620'><a href='#note-620' class='key'>§</a></span> altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole that you cut down, offer the second<span class='note' id='footnote-621'><a href='#note-621' class='key'>*</a></span> bull as a burnt offering.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_27' data-id='JG6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> told him. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_28' data-id='JG6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In the morning when the people of the town got up, there was Baal’s altar, demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_29' data-id='JG6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They asked each other, “Who did this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_29' data-id='JG6_29'>When they carefully investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_30' data-id='JG6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he has broken down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_31' data-id='JG6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But Joash replied to the hostile crowd around him, “Are you going to plead Baal’s cause? Are you trying to save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal really is a god, he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.” </span>
<span class='v JG6_32' data-id='JG6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So because Gideon broke down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal<span class='note' id='footnote-622'><a href='#note-622' class='key'>†</a></span> that day, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_33' data-id='JG6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Now all the Midianites, Amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the Jordan and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. </span>
<span class='v JG6_34' data-id='JG6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came on Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him. </span>
<span class='v JG6_35' data-id='JG6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, so that they too went up to meet them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_36' data-id='JG6_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Gideon said to God, “If you will save Israel by my hand as you have promised— </span>
<span class='v JG6_37' data-id='JG6_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>look, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you said.” </span>
<span class='v JG6_38' data-id='JG6_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And that is what happened. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG6_39' data-id='JG6_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then Gideon said to God, “Do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time make the fleece dry and let the ground be covered with dew.” </span>
<span class='v JG6_40' data-id='JG6_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>That night God did so. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew. </span></div></div>
