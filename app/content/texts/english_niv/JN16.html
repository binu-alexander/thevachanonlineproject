<span class='v JN16_2' data-id='JN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.</span></span>
<span class='v JN16_3' data-id='JN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you, </span></span>
<span class='v JN16_5' data-id='JN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>but now I am going to him who sent me. None of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</span></span>

<span class='v JN16_16' data-id='JN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus went on to say, <span class='wj'>“In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_17' data-id='JN16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying, <span class='wj'>‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me,’ </span> and <span class='wj'>‘Because I am going to the Father’</span>?” </span>
<span class='v JN16_18' data-id='JN16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They kept asking, “What does he mean by <span class='wj'>‘a little while’</span>? We don’t understand what he is saying.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_19' data-id='JN16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Are you asking one another what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will see me no more, and then after a little while you will see me’?</span></span>
<span class='v JN16_20' data-id='JN16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Very truly I tell you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.</span></span>

<span class='v JN16_23' data-id='JN16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In that day you will no longer ask me anything. Very truly I tell you, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.</span></span>
<span class='v JN16_24' data-id='JN16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and your joy will be complete.</span></span></div>

<span class='v JN16_26' data-id='JN16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In that day you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</span></span>
<span class='v JN16_27' data-id='JN16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>No, the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_29' data-id='JN16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus’ disciples said, “Now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech. </span>
<span class='v JN16_30' data-id='JN16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions. This makes us believe that you came from God.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_31' data-id='JN16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Do you now believe?”</span> Jesus replied. </span>
