<div class='s'>Jacob Prepares to Meet Esau </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_1' data-id='GN32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him. </span>
<span class='v GN32_2' data-id='GN32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.<span class='note' id='footnote-143'><a href='#note-143' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_3' data-id='GN32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. </span>
<span class='v GN32_4' data-id='GN32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now. </span>
<span class='v GN32_5' data-id='GN32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_6' data-id='GN32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_7' data-id='GN32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups,<span class='note' id='footnote-144'><a href='#note-144' class='key'>†</a></span> and the flocks and herds and camels as well. </span>
<span class='v GN32_8' data-id='GN32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group,<span class='note' id='footnote-145'><a href='#note-145' class='key'>‡</a></span> the group<span class='note' id='footnote-146'><a href='#note-146' class='key'>§</a></span> that is left may escape.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_9' data-id='GN32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’ </span>
<span class='v GN32_10' data-id='GN32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps. </span>
<span class='v GN32_11' data-id='GN32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children. </span>
<span class='v GN32_12' data-id='GN32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_13' data-id='GN32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau: </span>
<span class='v GN32_14' data-id='GN32_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, </span>
<span class='v GN32_15' data-id='GN32_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. </span>
<span class='v GN32_16' data-id='GN32_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_17' data-id='GN32_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’ </span>
<span class='v GN32_18' data-id='GN32_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_19' data-id='GN32_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He also instructed the second, the third and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. </span>
<span class='v GN32_20' data-id='GN32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.” </span>
<span class='v GN32_21' data-id='GN32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jacob Wrestles With God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_22' data-id='GN32_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. </span>
<span class='v GN32_23' data-id='GN32_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. </span>
<span class='v GN32_24' data-id='GN32_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. </span>
<span class='v GN32_25' data-id='GN32_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. </span>
<span class='v GN32_26' data-id='GN32_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_26' data-id='GN32_26'>But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_27' data-id='GN32_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The man asked him, “What is your name?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_27' data-id='GN32_27'>“Jacob,” he answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_28' data-id='GN32_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel,<span class='note' id='footnote-147'><a href='#note-147' class='key'>*</a></span> because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_29' data-id='GN32_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_29' data-id='GN32_29'>But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_30' data-id='GN32_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So Jacob called the place Peniel,<span class='note' id='footnote-148'><a href='#note-148' class='key'>†</a></span> saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN32_31' data-id='GN32_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel,<span class='note' id='footnote-149'><a href='#note-149' class='key'>‡</a></span> and he was limping because of his hip. </span>
<span class='v GN32_32' data-id='GN32_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon. </span></div></div>
