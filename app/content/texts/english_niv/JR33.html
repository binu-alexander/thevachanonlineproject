<span class='v JR33_4' data-id='JR33_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword </span>
<span class='v JR33_5' data-id='JR33_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>in the fight with the Babylonians<span class='note' id='footnote-1978'><a href='#note-1978' class='key'>*</a></span>: ‘They will be filled with the dead bodies of the people I will slay in my anger and wrath.

<span class='v JR33_6' data-id='JR33_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security. </span>
<span class='v JR33_7' data-id='JR33_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I will bring Judah and Israel back from captivity<span class='note' id='footnote-1979'><a href='#note-1979' class='key'>†</a></span> and will rebuild them as they were before. </span>
<span class='v JR33_8' data-id='JR33_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me. </span>
<span class='v JR33_9' data-id='JR33_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then this city will bring me renown, joy, praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things I do for it; and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’ </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v JR33_17' data-id='JR33_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘David will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of Israel, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR33_19' data-id='JR33_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah: </span>

<span class='v JR33_25' data-id='JR33_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘If I have not made my covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth, </span>
