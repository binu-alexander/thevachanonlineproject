<span class='v LK13_1' data-id='LK13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. </span>
<span class='v LK13_2' data-id='LK13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way?</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_3' data-id='LK13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_4' data-id='LK13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_6' data-id='LK13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he told this parable: <span class='wj'>“A man had a fig tree growing in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any.</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_7' data-id='LK13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, ‘For three years now I’ve been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_8' data-id='LK13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘Sir,’ the man replied, ‘leave it alone for one more year, and I’ll dig around it and fertilize it.</span></span>

<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Crippled Woman on the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_10' data-id='LK13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On a Sabbath Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues, </span>
<span class='v LK13_11' data-id='LK13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all. </span>
<span class='v LK13_12' data-id='LK13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, <span class='wj'>“Woman, you are set free from your infirmity.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_13' data-id='LK13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he put his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and praised God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_14' data-id='LK13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, the synagogue leader said to the people, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_15' data-id='LK13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Lord answered him, <span class='wj'>“You hypocrites! Doesn’t each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water?</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_16' data-id='LK13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”</span></span></div>

<span class='v LK13_17' data-id='LK13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When he said this, all his opponents were humiliated, but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parables of the Mustard Seed and the Yeast </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_18' data-id='LK13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus asked, <span class='wj'>“What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it to?</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_19' data-id='LK13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds perched in its branches.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_20' data-id='LK13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Again he asked, <span class='wj'>“What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?</span></span>
<span class='v LK13_21' data-id='LK13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into about sixty pounds</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2670'><a href='#note-2670' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>of flour until it worked all through the dough.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Narrow Door </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK13_22' data-id='LK13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he made his way to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK13_23' data-id='LK13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?” </span></div>
