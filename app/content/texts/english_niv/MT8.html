<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_1' data-id='MT8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came down from the mountainside, large crowds followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_2' data-id='MT8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A man with leprosy<span class='note' id='footnote-2471'><a href='#note-2471' class='key'>*</a></span> came and knelt before him and said, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_3' data-id='MT8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <span class='wj'>“I am willing,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“Be clean!”</span> Immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. </span>
<span class='v MT8_4' data-id='MT8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Faith of the Centurion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_5' data-id='MT8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help. </span>
<span class='v MT8_6' data-id='MT8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_7' data-id='MT8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Shall I come and heal him?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_8' data-id='MT8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The centurion replied, “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class='v MT8_9' data-id='MT8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_10' data-id='MT8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those following him, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</span></span>
<span class='v MT8_11' data-id='MT8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span></span>
<span class='v MT8_12' data-id='MT8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_13' data-id='MT8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to the centurion, <span class='wj'>“Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.”</span> And his servant was healed at that moment. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_14' data-id='MT8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever. </span>
<span class='v MT8_15' data-id='MT8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_16' data-id='MT8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to him, and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick. </span>
<span class='v MT8_17' data-id='MT8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT8_17' data-id='MT8_17'>“He took up our infirmities </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='s'>The Cost of Following Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_18' data-id='MT8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake. </span>
<span class='v MT8_19' data-id='MT8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then a teacher of the law came to him and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_20' data-id='MT8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_21' data-id='MT8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Another disciple said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_22' data-id='MT8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calms the Storm </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_23' data-id='MT8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_24' data-id='MT8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Suddenly a furious storm came up on the lake, so that the waves swept over the boat. But Jesus was sleeping. </span>
<span class='v MT8_25' data-id='MT8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to drown!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_26' data-id='MT8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“You of little faith, why are you so afraid?”</span> Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves, and it was completely calm. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_27' data-id='MT8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the waves obey him!” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Restores Two Demon-Possessed Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_28' data-id='MT8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes,<span class='note' id='footnote-2473'><a href='#note-2473' class='key'>‡</a></span> two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were so violent that no one could pass that way. </span>
<span class='v MT8_29' data-id='MT8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“What do you want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have you come here to torture us before the appointed time?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_30' data-id='MT8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding. </span>
<span class='v MT8_31' data-id='MT8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The demons begged Jesus, “If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_32' data-id='MT8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Go!”</span> So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water. </span>
<span class='v MT8_33' data-id='MT8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Those tending the pigs ran off, went into the town and reported all this, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. </span>
<span class='v MT8_34' data-id='MT8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they pleaded with him to leave their region. </span></div></div>
