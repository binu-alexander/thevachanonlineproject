<div class='s'>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_1' data-id='LK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One Sabbath Jesus was going through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain, rub them in their hands and eat the kernels. </span>
<span class='v LK6_2' data-id='LK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_3' data-id='LK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span></span>
<span class='v LK6_4' data-id='LK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He entered the house of God, and taking the consecrated bread, he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat. And he also gave some to his companions.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK6_5' data-id='LK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_6' data-id='LK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled. </span>
<span class='v LK6_7' data-id='LK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v LK6_8' data-id='LK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand, <span class='wj'>“Get up and stand in front of everyone.”</span> So he got up and stood there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_9' data-id='LK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_10' data-id='LK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He looked around at them all, and then said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did so, and his hand was completely restored. </span>
<span class='v LK6_11' data-id='LK6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Twelve Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_12' data-id='LK6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>One of those days Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the night praying to God. </span>
<span class='v LK6_13' data-id='LK6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When morning came, he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated apostles: </span>
<span class='v LK6_14' data-id='LK6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, </span>

<span class='v LK6_17' data-id='LK6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region around Tyre and Sidon, </span>
<span class='v LK6_18' data-id='LK6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by impure spirits were cured, </span>
<span class='v LK6_19' data-id='LK6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and the people all tried to touch him, because power was coming from him and healing them all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_20' data-id='LK6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Looking at his disciples, he said: </span></div>
