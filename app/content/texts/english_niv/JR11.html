<div class='s'>The Covenant Is Broken </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_1' data-id='JR11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v JR11_2' data-id='JR11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of Judah and to those who live in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR11_3' data-id='JR11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Tell them that this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Cursed is the one who does not obey the terms of this covenant— </span>
<span class='v JR11_4' data-id='JR11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>the terms I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the iron-smelting furnace.’ I said, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you, and you will be my people, and I will be your God. </span>
<span class='v JR11_5' data-id='JR11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I will fulfill the oath I swore to your ancestors, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey’—the land you possess today.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_5' data-id='JR11_5'>I answered, “Amen, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_6' data-id='JR11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_7' data-id='JR11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>From the time I brought your ancestors up from Egypt until today, I warned them again and again, saying, “Obey me.” </span>
<span class='v JR11_8' data-id='JR11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But they did not listen or pay attention; instead, they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts. So I brought on them all the curses of the covenant I had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_9' data-id='JR11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “There is a conspiracy among the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR11_10' data-id='JR11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They have returned to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to listen to my words. They have followed other gods to serve them. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. </span>
<span class='v JR11_11' data-id='JR11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_12' data-id='JR11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The towns of Judah and the people of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes. </span>
<span class='v JR11_13' data-id='JR11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns; and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god Baal are as many as the streets of Jerusalem.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_14' data-id='JR11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Do not pray for this people or offer any plea or petition for them, because I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress. </span></div>

<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“What is my beloved doing in my temple </span></div>

<div class='s'>Plot Against Jeremiah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_18' data-id='JR11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> revealed their plot to me, I knew it, for at that time he showed me what they were doing. </span>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter; I did not realize that they had plotted against me, saying, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But you, <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, who judge righteously </span></div>

<span class='v JR11_22' data-id='JR11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: “I will punish them. Their young men will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. </span>
