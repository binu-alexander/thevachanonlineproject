<span class='v EK26_2' data-id='EK26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, because Tyre has said of Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gate to the nations is broken, and its doors have swung open to me; now that she lies in ruins I will prosper,’ </span>
<span class='v EK26_3' data-id='EK26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>therefore this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the sea casting up its waves. </span>
<span class='v EK26_4' data-id='EK26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They will destroy the walls of Tyre and pull down her towers; I will scrape away her rubble and make her a bare rock. </span>
<span class='v EK26_5' data-id='EK26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Out in the sea she will become a place to spread fishnets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. She will become plunder for the nations, </span>
<span class='v EK26_6' data-id='EK26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and her settlements on the mainland will be ravaged by the sword. Then they will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v EK26_8' data-id='EK26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise his shields against you. </span>
<span class='v EK26_9' data-id='EK26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He will direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and demolish your towers with his weapons. </span>
<span class='v EK26_10' data-id='EK26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>His horses will be so many that they will cover you with dust.

<span class='v EK26_11' data-id='EK26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The hooves of his horses will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground. </span>
<span class='v EK26_12' data-id='EK26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will break down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea. </span>
<span class='v EK26_13' data-id='EK26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the music of your harps will be heard no more. </span>
