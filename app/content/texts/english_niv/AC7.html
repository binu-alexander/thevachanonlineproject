<span class='v AC7_1' data-id='AC7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the high priest asked Stephen, “Are these charges true?” </span></div>

<span class='v AC7_2' data-id='AC7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>To this he replied: “Brothers and fathers, listen to me! The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was still in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Harran. </span>
<span class='v AC7_3' data-id='AC7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>‘Leave your country and your people,’ God said, ‘and go to the land I will show you.’<span class='note' id='footnote-2797'><a href='#note-2797' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC7_4' data-id='AC7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“So he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Harran. After the death of his father, God sent him to this land where you are now living. </span>
<span class='v AC7_5' data-id='AC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He gave him no inheritance here, not even enough ground to set his foot on. But God promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land, even though at that time Abraham had no child. </span>
<span class='v AC7_6' data-id='AC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>God spoke to him in this way: ‘For four hundred years your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated. </span>
<span class='v AC7_7' data-id='AC7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ God said, ‘and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place.’<span class='note' id='footnote-2798'><a href='#note-2798' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v AC7_8' data-id='AC7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC7_9' data-id='AC7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Because the patriarchs were jealous of Joseph, they sold him as a slave into Egypt. But God was with him </span>
<span class='v AC7_10' data-id='AC7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and rescued him from all his troubles. He gave Joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of Pharaoh king of Egypt. So Pharaoh made him ruler over Egypt and all his palace. </span></div>

<span class='v AC7_13' data-id='AC7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>On their second visit, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and Pharaoh learned about Joseph’s family. </span>
<span class='v AC7_14' data-id='AC7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>After this, Joseph sent for his father Jacob and his whole family, seventy-five in all. </span>

<span class='v AC7_25' data-id='AC7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Moses thought that his own people would realize that God was using him to rescue them, but they did not. </span>
<span class='v AC7_26' data-id='AC7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The next day Moses came upon two Israelites who were fighting. He tried to reconcile them by saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you want to hurt each other?’ </span></div>
