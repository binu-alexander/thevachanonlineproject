<div class='s'>The Scroll and the Lamb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_1' data-id='RV5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals. </span>
<span class='v RV5_2' data-id='RV5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” </span>
<span class='v RV5_3' data-id='RV5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it. </span>
<span class='v RV5_4' data-id='RV5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. </span>
<span class='v RV5_5' data-id='RV5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_6' data-id='RV5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing at the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits<span class='note' id='footnote-3278'><a href='#note-3278' class='key'>*</a></span> of God sent out into all the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV5_7' data-id='RV5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV5_8' data-id='RV5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people. </span>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And they sang a new song, saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>“You are worthy to take the scroll </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>and to open its seals, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>because you were slain, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>and with your blood you purchased for God </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>persons from every tribe and language and people and nation. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_10' data-id='RV5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_10' data-id='RV5_10'>and they will reign<span class='note' id='footnote-3279'><a href='#note-3279' class='key'>†</a></span> on the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_11' data-id='RV5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels, numbering thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand. They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders. </span>
<span class='v RV5_12' data-id='RV5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In a loud voice they were saying: </span></div>

<span class='v RV5_12' data-id='RV5_12'>“Worthy is the Lamb, who was slain, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<span class='v RV5_12' data-id='RV5_12'>and honor and glory and praise!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_13' data-id='RV5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_13' data-id='RV5_13'>“To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_13' data-id='RV5_13'>be praise and honor and glory and power, </span></div>
<div class='qc'>for ever and ever!” </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV5_14' data-id='RV5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped. </span></div></div>
