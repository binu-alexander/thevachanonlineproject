<div class='s'>A Call to Return to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_1' data-id='ZC1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_2' data-id='ZC1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was very angry with your ancestors. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_3' data-id='ZC1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Therefore tell the people: This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: ‘Return to me,’ declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_4' data-id='ZC1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Do not be like your ancestors, to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed: This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil practices.’ But they would not listen or pay attention to me, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_5' data-id='ZC1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live forever? </span>
<span class='v ZC1_6' data-id='ZC1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But did not my words and my decrees, which I commanded my servants the prophets, overtake your ancestors? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_6' data-id='ZC1_6'>“Then they repented and said, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve, just as he determined to do.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Man Among the Myrtle Trees </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_7' data-id='ZC1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah, the son of Iddo. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_8' data-id='ZC1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>During the night I had a vision, and there before me was a man mounted on a red horse. He was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him were red, brown and white horses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_9' data-id='ZC1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I asked, “What are these, my lord?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_9' data-id='ZC1_9'>The angel who was talking with me answered, “I will show you what they are.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_10' data-id='ZC1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has sent to go throughout the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_11' data-id='ZC1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they reported to the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_12' data-id='ZC1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “<span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, how long will you withhold mercy from Jerusalem and from the towns of Judah, which you have been angry with these seventy years?” </span>
<span class='v ZC1_13' data-id='ZC1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_14' data-id='ZC1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the angel who was speaking to me said, “Proclaim this word: This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion, </span>
<span class='v ZC1_15' data-id='ZC1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and I am very angry with the nations that feel secure. I was only a little angry, but they went too far with the punishment.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_16' data-id='ZC1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,’ declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_17' data-id='ZC1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Proclaim further: This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: ‘My towns will again overflow with prosperity, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’ ” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_18' data-id='ZC1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then I looked up, and there before me were four horns. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_19' data-id='ZC1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I asked the angel who was speaking to me, “What are these?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_19' data-id='ZC1_19'>He answered me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel and Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_20' data-id='ZC1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> showed me four craftsmen. </span>
<span class='v ZC1_21' data-id='ZC1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I asked, “What are these coming to do?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC1_21' data-id='ZC1_21'>He answered, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so that no one could raise their head, but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter its people.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2401'><a href='#note-2401' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div></div>
