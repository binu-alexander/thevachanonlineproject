<div class='s'>Paul’s Trial Before Felix </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_1' data-id='AC24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Five days later the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they brought their charges against Paul before the governor. </span>
<span class='v AC24_2' data-id='AC24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented his case before Felix: “We have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation. </span>
<span class='v AC24_3' data-id='AC24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Everywhere and in every way, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with profound gratitude. </span>
<span class='v AC24_4' data-id='AC24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But in order not to weary you further, I would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_5' data-id='AC24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the Nazarene sect </span>
<span class='v AC24_6' data-id='AC24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. By<span class='note' id='footnote-2846'><a href='#note-2846' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v AC24_8' data-id='AC24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_9' data-id='AC24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The other Jews joined in the accusation, asserting that these things were true. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_10' data-id='AC24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation; so I gladly make my defense. </span>
<span class='v AC24_11' data-id='AC24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. </span>
<span class='v AC24_12' data-id='AC24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city. </span>
<span class='v AC24_13' data-id='AC24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me. </span>
<span class='v AC24_14' data-id='AC24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>However, I admit that I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and that is written in the Prophets, </span>
<span class='v AC24_15' data-id='AC24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. </span>
<span class='v AC24_16' data-id='AC24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_17' data-id='AC24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“After an absence of several years, I came to Jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings. </span>
<span class='v AC24_18' data-id='AC24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this. There was no crowd with me, nor was I involved in any disturbance. </span>
<span class='v AC24_19' data-id='AC24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But there are some Jews from the province of Asia, who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me. </span>
<span class='v AC24_20' data-id='AC24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin— </span>
<span class='v AC24_21' data-id='AC24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>unless it was this one thing I shouted as I stood in their presence: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_22' data-id='AC24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Felix, who was well acquainted with the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.” </span>
<span class='v AC24_23' data-id='AC24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He ordered the centurion to keep Paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_24' data-id='AC24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Several days later Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC24_25' data-id='AC24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and said, “That’s enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will send for you.” </span>
<span class='v AC24_26' data-id='AC24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>At the same time he was hoping that Paul would offer him a bribe, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC24_27' data-id='AC24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favor to the Jews, he left Paul in prison. </span></div></div>
