<div class='s'>Rahab and the Spies </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_1' data-id='JS2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two spies from Shittim. “Go, look over the land,” he said, “especially Jericho.” So they went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_2' data-id='JS2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.” </span>
<span class='v JS2_3' data-id='JS2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house, because they have come to spy out the whole land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_4' data-id='JS2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She said, “Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know where they had come from. </span>
<span class='v JS2_5' data-id='JS2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know which way they went. Go after them quickly. You may catch up with them.” </span>
<span class='v JS2_6' data-id='JS2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>(But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.) </span>
<span class='v JS2_7' data-id='JS2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_8' data-id='JS2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up on the roof </span>
<span class='v JS2_9' data-id='JS2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “I know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. </span>
<span class='v JS2_10' data-id='JS2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>We have heard how the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> dried up the water of the Red Sea<span class='note' id='footnote-554'><a href='#note-554' class='key'>*</a></span> for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.<span class='note' id='footnote-555'><a href='#note-555' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v JS2_11' data-id='JS2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed because of you, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_12' data-id='JS2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Now then, please swear to me by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign </span>
<span class='v JS2_13' data-id='JS2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them—and that you will save us from death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_14' data-id='JS2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Our lives for your lives!” the men assured her. “If you don’t tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gives us the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_15' data-id='JS2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So she let them down by a rope through the window, for the house she lived in was part of the city wall. </span>
<span class='v JS2_16' data-id='JS2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>She said to them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on your way.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_17' data-id='JS2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now the men had said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us </span>
<span class='v JS2_18' data-id='JS2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and unless you have brought your father and mother, your brothers and all your family into your house. </span>
<span class='v JS2_19' data-id='JS2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. As for those who are in the house with you, their blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on them. </span>
<span class='v JS2_20' data-id='JS2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_21' data-id='JS2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Agreed,” she replied. “Let it be as you say.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_21' data-id='JS2_21'>So she sent them away, and they departed. And she tied the scarlet cord in the window. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS2_22' data-id='JS2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When they left, they went into the hills and stayed there three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them. </span>
<span class='v JS2_23' data-id='JS2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then the two men started back. They went down out of the hills, forded the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. </span>
<span class='v JS2_24' data-id='JS2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>They said to Joshua, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has surely given the whole land into our hands; all the people are melting in fear because of us.” </span></div></div>
