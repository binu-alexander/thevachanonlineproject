<div class='s'>Jacob Takes Esau’s Blessing </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_1' data-id='GN27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called for Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_1' data-id='GN27_1'>“Here I am,” he answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_2' data-id='GN27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Isaac said, “I am now an old man and don’t know the day of my death. </span>
<span class='v GN27_3' data-id='GN27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now then, get your equipment—your quiver and bow—and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me. </span>
<span class='v GN27_4' data-id='GN27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Prepare me the kind of tasty food I like and bring it to me to eat, so that I may give you my blessing before I die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_5' data-id='GN27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. When Esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back, </span>
<span class='v GN27_6' data-id='GN27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Look, I overheard your father say to your brother Esau, </span>
<span class='v GN27_7' data-id='GN27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>‘Bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat, so that I may give you my blessing in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> before I die.’ </span>
<span class='v GN27_8' data-id='GN27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now, my son, listen carefully and do what I tell you: </span>
<span class='v GN27_9' data-id='GN27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so I can prepare some tasty food for your father, just the way he likes it. </span>
<span class='v GN27_10' data-id='GN27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may give you his blessing before he dies.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_11' data-id='GN27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin. </span>
<span class='v GN27_12' data-id='GN27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>What if my father touches me? I would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_13' data-id='GN27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>His mother said to him, “My son, let the curse fall on me. Just do what I say; go and get them for me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_14' data-id='GN27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared some tasty food, just the way his father liked it. </span>
<span class='v GN27_15' data-id='GN27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son, which she had in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN27_16' data-id='GN27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins. </span>
<span class='v GN27_17' data-id='GN27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then she handed to her son Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_18' data-id='GN27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He went to his father and said, “My father.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_18' data-id='GN27_18'>“Yes, my son,” he answered. “Who is it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_19' data-id='GN27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_20' data-id='GN27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_20' data-id='GN27_20'>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God gave me success,” he replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_21' data-id='GN27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_22' data-id='GN27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_23' data-id='GN27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he proceeded to bless him. </span>
<span class='v GN27_24' data-id='GN27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Are you really my son Esau?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_24' data-id='GN27_24'>“I am,” he replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_25' data-id='GN27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “My son, bring me some of your game to eat, so that I may give you my blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_25' data-id='GN27_25'>Jacob brought it to him and he ate; and he brought some wine and he drank. </span>
<span class='v GN27_26' data-id='GN27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come here, my son, and kiss me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So he went to him and kissed him. When Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he blessed him and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'>“Ah, the smell of my son </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'>is like the smell of a field </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'>that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has blessed. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>May God give you heaven’s dew </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'>and earth’s richness— </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'>an abundance of grain and new wine. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>May nations serve you </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and peoples bow down to you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>Be lord over your brothers, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>May those who curse you be cursed </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and those who bless you be blessed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_30' data-id='GN27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>After Isaac finished blessing him, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, his brother Esau came in from hunting. </span>
<span class='v GN27_31' data-id='GN27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “My father, please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may give me your blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_32' data-id='GN27_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_32' data-id='GN27_32'>“I am your son,” he answered, “your firstborn, Esau.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_33' data-id='GN27_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who was it, then, that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it just before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he will be blessed!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_34' data-id='GN27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When Esau heard his father’s words, he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me—me too, my father!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_35' data-id='GN27_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_36' data-id='GN27_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Esau said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob<span class='note' id='footnote-118'><a href='#note-118' class='key'>*</a></span>? This is the second time he has taken advantage of me: He took my birthright, and now he’s taken my blessing!” Then he asked, “Haven’t you reserved any blessing for me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_37' data-id='GN27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Isaac answered Esau, “I have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants, and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. So what can I possibly do for you, my son?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_38' data-id='GN27_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” Then Esau wept aloud. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>His father Isaac answered him, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'>“Your dwelling will be </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'>away from the earth’s richness, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'>away from the dew of heaven above. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>You will live by the sword </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>and you will serve your brother. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>But when you grow restless, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>you will throw his yoke </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>from off your neck.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_41' data-id='GN27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. He said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_42' data-id='GN27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>When Rebekah was told what her older son Esau had said, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Your brother Esau is planning to avenge himself by killing you. </span>
<span class='v GN27_43' data-id='GN27_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Now then, my son, do what I say: Flee at once to my brother Laban in Harran. </span>
<span class='v GN27_44' data-id='GN27_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Stay with him for a while until your brother’s fury subsides. </span>
<span class='v GN27_45' data-id='GN27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I’ll send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_46' data-id='GN27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m disgusted with living because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land, from Hittite women like these, my life will not be worth living.” </span></div></div>
