<div class='s'>A Common Destiny for All </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_1' data-id='EC9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So I reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in God’s hands, but no one knows whether love or hate awaits them. </span>
<span class='v EC9_2' data-id='EC9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>All share a common destiny—the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad,<span class='note' id='footnote-1767'><a href='#note-1767' class='key'>*</a></span> the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_2' data-id='EC9_2'>As it is with the good, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_2' data-id='EC9_2'>so with the sinful; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_2' data-id='EC9_2'>as it is with those who take oaths, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_2' data-id='EC9_2'>so with those who are afraid to take them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_3' data-id='EC9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is the evil in everything that happens under the sun: The same destiny overtakes all. The hearts of people, moreover, are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live, and afterward they join the dead. </span>
<span class='v EC9_4' data-id='EC9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Anyone who is among the living has hope<span class='note' id='footnote-1768'><a href='#note-1768' class='key'>†</a></span>—even a live dog is better off than a dead lion! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_5' data-id='EC9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For the living know that they will die, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_5' data-id='EC9_5'>but the dead know nothing; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_5' data-id='EC9_5'>they have no further reward, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_5' data-id='EC9_5'>and even their name is forgotten. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_6' data-id='EC9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Their love, their hate </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_6' data-id='EC9_6'>and their jealousy have long since vanished; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_6' data-id='EC9_6'>never again will they have a part </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_6' data-id='EC9_6'>in anything that happens under the sun. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_7' data-id='EC9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Go, eat your food with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved what you do. </span>
<span class='v EC9_8' data-id='EC9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil. </span>
<span class='v EC9_9' data-id='EC9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Enjoy life with your wife, whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days. For this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC9_10' data-id='EC9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I have seen something else under the sun: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>The race is not to the swift </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>or the battle to the strong, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>nor does food come to the wise </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>or wealth to the brilliant </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>or favor to the learned; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_11' data-id='EC9_11'>but time and chance happen to them all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_12' data-id='EC9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Moreover, no one knows when their hour will come: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_12' data-id='EC9_12'>As fish are caught in a cruel net, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_12' data-id='EC9_12'>or birds are taken in a snare, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_12' data-id='EC9_12'>so people are trapped by evil times </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_12' data-id='EC9_12'>that fall unexpectedly upon them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Wisdom Better Than Folly </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC9_13' data-id='EC9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me: </span>
<span class='v EC9_14' data-id='EC9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. </span>
<span class='v EC9_15' data-id='EC9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man. </span>
<span class='v EC9_16' data-id='EC9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” But the poor man’s wisdom is despised, and his words are no longer heeded. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_17' data-id='EC9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_17' data-id='EC9_17'>than the shouts of a ruler of fools. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC9_18' data-id='EC9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC9_18' data-id='EC9_18'>but one sinner destroys much good. </span></div>
