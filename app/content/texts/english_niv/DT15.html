<div class='s'>The Year for Canceling Debts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_1' data-id='DT15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. </span>
<span class='v DT15_2' data-id='DT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is how it is to be done: Every creditor shall cancel any loan they have made to a fellow Israelite. They shall not require payment from anyone among their own people, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s time for canceling debts has been proclaimed. </span>
<span class='v DT15_3' data-id='DT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You may require payment from a foreigner, but you must cancel any debt your fellow Israelite owes you. </span>
<span class='v DT15_4' data-id='DT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>However, there need be no poor people among you, for in the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you to possess as your inheritance, he will richly bless you, </span>
<span class='v DT15_5' data-id='DT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>if only you fully obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and are careful to follow all these commands I am giving you today. </span>
<span class='v DT15_6' data-id='DT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will bless you as he has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none. You will rule over many nations but none will rule over you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_7' data-id='DT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If anyone is poor among your fellow Israelites in any of the towns of the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you, do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward them. </span>
<span class='v DT15_8' data-id='DT15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Rather, be openhanded and freely lend them whatever they need. </span>
<span class='v DT15_9' data-id='DT15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be careful not to harbor this wicked thought: “The seventh year, the year for canceling debts, is near,” so that you do not show ill will toward the needy among your fellow Israelites and give them nothing. They may then appeal to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> against you, and you will be found guilty of sin. </span>
<span class='v DT15_10' data-id='DT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Give generously to them and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to. </span>
<span class='v DT15_11' data-id='DT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There will always be poor people in the land. Therefore I command you to be openhanded toward your fellow Israelites who are poor and needy in your land. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Freeing Servants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_12' data-id='DT15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If any of your people—Hebrew men or women—sell themselves to you and serve you six years, in the seventh year you must let them go free. </span>
<span class='v DT15_13' data-id='DT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed. </span>
<span class='v DT15_14' data-id='DT15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Supply them liberally from your flock, your threshing floor and your winepress. Give to them as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has blessed you. </span>
<span class='v DT15_15' data-id='DT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God redeemed you. That is why I give you this command today. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_16' data-id='DT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But if your servant says to you, “I do not want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and is well off with you, </span>
<span class='v DT15_17' data-id='DT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>then take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door, and he will become your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_18' data-id='DT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will bless you in everything you do. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Firstborn Animals </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT15_19' data-id='DT15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Set apart for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God every firstborn male of your herds and flocks. Do not put the firstborn of your cows to work, and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep. </span>
<span class='v DT15_20' data-id='DT15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God at the place he will choose. </span>
<span class='v DT15_21' data-id='DT15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If an animal has a defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. </span>
<span class='v DT15_22' data-id='DT15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You are to eat it in your own towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer. </span>
<span class='v DT15_23' data-id='DT15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water. </span></div></div>
