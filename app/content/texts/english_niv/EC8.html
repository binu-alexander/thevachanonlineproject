<span class='v EC8_1' data-id='EC8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Who is like the wise? </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_1' data-id='EC8_1'>Who knows the explanation of things? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_1' data-id='EC8_1'>A person’s wisdom brightens their face </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_1' data-id='EC8_1'>and changes its hard appearance. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Obey the King </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC8_2' data-id='EC8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. </span>
<span class='v EC8_3' data-id='EC8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. </span>
<span class='v EC8_4' data-id='EC8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_5' data-id='EC8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_5' data-id='EC8_5'>and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_6' data-id='EC8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_6' data-id='EC8_6'>though a person may be weighed down by misery. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_7' data-id='EC8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Since no one knows the future, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_7' data-id='EC8_7'>who can tell someone else what is to come? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_8' data-id='EC8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As no one has power over the wind to contain it, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_8' data-id='EC8_8'>so<span class='note' id='footnote-1764'><a href='#note-1764' class='key'>*</a></span> no one has power over the time of their death. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC8_8' data-id='EC8_8'>As no one is discharged in time of war, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC8_8' data-id='EC8_8'>so wickedness will not release those who practice it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC8_9' data-id='EC8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>All this I saw, as I applied my mind to everything done under the sun. There is a time when a man lords it over others to his own<span class='note' id='footnote-1765'><a href='#note-1765' class='key'>†</a></span> hurt. </span>
<span class='v EC8_10' data-id='EC8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then too, I saw the wicked buried—those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise<span class='note' id='footnote-1766'><a href='#note-1766' class='key'>‡</a></span> in the city where they did this. This too is meaningless. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC8_11' data-id='EC8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people’s hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong. </span>
<span class='v EC8_12' data-id='EC8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Although a wicked person who commits a hundred crimes may live a long time, I know that it will go better with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. </span>
<span class='v EC8_13' data-id='EC8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Yet because the wicked do not fear God, it will not go well with them, and their days will not lengthen like a shadow. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC8_14' data-id='EC8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>There is something else meaningless that occurs on earth: the righteous who get what the wicked deserve, and the wicked who get what the righteous deserve. This too, I say, is meaningless. </span>
<span class='v EC8_15' data-id='EC8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So I commend the enjoyment of life, because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad. Then joy will accompany them in their toil all the days of the life God has given them under the sun. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC8_16' data-id='EC8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When I applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe the labor that is done on earth—people getting no sleep day or night— </span>
<span class='v EC8_17' data-id='EC8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>then I saw all that God has done. No one can comprehend what goes on under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim they know, they cannot really comprehend it. </span></div></div>
