<span class='v S26_1' data-id='S26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David again brought together all the able young men of Israel—thirty thousand. </span>
<span class='v S26_2' data-id='S26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He and all his men went to Baalah<span class='note' id='footnote-752'><a href='#note-752' class='key'>*</a></span> in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name,<span class='note' id='footnote-753'><a href='#note-753' class='key'>†</a></span> the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark. </span>
<span class='v S26_3' data-id='S26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart </span>
<span class='v S26_4' data-id='S26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>with the ark of God on it,<span class='note' id='footnote-754'><a href='#note-754' class='key'>‡</a></span> and Ahio was walking in front of it. </span>
<span class='v S26_5' data-id='S26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, with castanets,<span class='note' id='footnote-755'><a href='#note-755' class='key'>§</a></span> harps, lyres, timbrels, sistrums and cymbals. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_6' data-id='S26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. </span>
<span class='v S26_7' data-id='S26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down, and he died there beside the ark of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_8' data-id='S26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then David was angry because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s wrath had broken out against Uzzah, and to this day that place is called Perez Uzzah.<span class='note' id='footnote-756'><a href='#note-756' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_9' data-id='S26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>David was afraid of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that day and said, “How can the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> ever come to me?” </span>
<span class='v S26_10' data-id='S26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He was not willing to take the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to be with him in the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite. </span>
<span class='v S26_11' data-id='S26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> remained in the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite for three months, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> blessed him and his entire household. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_12' data-id='S26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now King David was told, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has blessed the household of Obed-Edom and everything he has, because of the ark of God.” So David went to bring up the ark of God from the house of Obed-Edom to the City of David with rejoicing. </span>
<span class='v S26_13' data-id='S26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When those who were carrying the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had taken six steps, he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf. </span>
<span class='v S26_14' data-id='S26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Wearing a linen ephod, David was dancing before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with all his might, </span>
<span class='v S26_15' data-id='S26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>while he and all Israel were bringing up the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with shouts and the sound of trumpets. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_16' data-id='S26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>As the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was entering the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul watched from a window. And when she saw King David leaping and dancing before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, she despised him in her heart. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_17' data-id='S26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They brought the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and set it in its place inside the tent that David had pitched for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S26_18' data-id='S26_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>After he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v S26_19' data-id='S26_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then he gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of Israelites, both men and women. And all the people went to their homes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_20' data-id='S26_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When David returned home to bless his household, Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet him and said, “How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today, going around half-naked in full view of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_21' data-id='S26_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>David said to Michal, “It was before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s people Israel—I will celebrate before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S26_22' data-id='S26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I will become even more undignified than this, and I will be humiliated in my own eyes. But by these slave girls you spoke of, I will be held in honor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S26_23' data-id='S26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Michal daughter of Saul had no children to the day of her death. </span></div></div>
