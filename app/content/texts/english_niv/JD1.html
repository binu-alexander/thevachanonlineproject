<span class='v JD1_3' data-id='JD1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt compelled to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to God’s holy people. </span>
<span class='v JD1_4' data-id='JD1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about<span class='note' id='footnote-3262'><a href='#note-3262' class='key'>†</a></span> long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JD1_5' data-id='JD1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Though you already know all this, I want to remind you that the Lord<span class='note' id='footnote-3263'><a href='#note-3263' class='key'>‡</a></span> at one time delivered his people out of Egypt, but later destroyed those who did not believe. </span>
<span class='v JD1_6' data-id='JD1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their proper dwelling—these he has kept in darkness, bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great Day. </span>
<span class='v JD1_7' data-id='JD1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JD1_8' data-id='JD1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. </span>
<span class='v JD1_9' data-id='JD1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”<span class='note' id='footnote-3264'><a href='#note-3264' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v JD1_10' data-id='JD1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them. </span></div>

<span class='v JD1_11' data-id='JD1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JD1_12' data-id='JD1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves.

<span class='v JD1_13' data-id='JD1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever. </span></div>

<span class='v JD1_17' data-id='JD1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. </span>
