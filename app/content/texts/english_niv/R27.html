<div class='s'>The Dedication of the Temple </div>

<span class='v R27_1' data-id='R27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> filled the temple. </span>
<span class='v R27_2' data-id='R27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The priests could not enter the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> because the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> filled it. </span>
<span class='v R27_3' data-id='R27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v R27_3' data-id='R27_3'>“He is good; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v R27_3' data-id='R27_3'>his love endures forever.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v R27_4' data-id='R27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R27_5' data-id='R27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the people dedicated the temple of God. </span>
<span class='v R27_6' data-id='R27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The priests took their positions, as did the Levites with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s musical instruments, which King David had made for praising the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and which were used when he gave thanks, saying, “His love endures forever.” Opposite the Levites, the priests blew their trumpets, and all the Israelites were standing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R27_7' data-id='R27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat portions. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R27_8' data-id='R27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v R27_9' data-id='R27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day they held an assembly, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more. </span>
<span class='v R27_10' data-id='R27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes, joyful and glad in heart for the good things the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had done for David and Solomon and for his people Israel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Appears to Solomon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R27_11' data-id='R27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When Solomon had finished the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the royal palace, and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and in his own palace, </span>
<span class='v R27_12' data-id='R27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to him at night and said: </span></div>

<span class='v R27_20' data-id='R27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>then I will uproot Israel from my land, which I have given them, and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. I will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples. </span>
<span class='v R27_21' data-id='R27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>This temple will become a heap of rubble.

<span class='v R27_22' data-id='R27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>People will answer, ‘Because they have forsaken the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods, worshiping and serving them—that is why he brought all this disaster on them.’ ” </span></div></div>
