<div class='s'>Jesus Has Risen </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_1' data-id='MT28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_2' data-id='MT28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. </span>
<span class='v MT28_3' data-id='MT28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. </span>
<span class='v MT28_4' data-id='MT28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_5' data-id='MT28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. </span>
<span class='v MT28_6' data-id='MT28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. </span>
<span class='v MT28_7' data-id='MT28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_8' data-id='MT28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT28_9' data-id='MT28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Suddenly Jesus met them. <span class='wj'>“Greetings,”</span> he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. </span>
<span class='v MT28_10' data-id='MT28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Guards’ Report </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_11' data-id='MT28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. </span>
<span class='v MT28_12' data-id='MT28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money, </span>
<span class='v MT28_13' data-id='MT28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>telling them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ </span>
<span class='v MT28_14' data-id='MT28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If this report gets to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_15' data-id='MT28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this very day. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Great Commission </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_16' data-id='MT28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. </span>
<span class='v MT28_17' data-id='MT28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. </span>
<span class='v MT28_18' data-id='MT28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came to them and said, <span class='wj'>“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span></span>
<span class='v MT28_19' data-id='MT28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </span></span>
<span class='v MT28_20' data-id='MT28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”</span></span></div></div>
