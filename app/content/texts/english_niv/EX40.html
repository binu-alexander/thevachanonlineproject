<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX40_30' data-id='EX40_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing, </span>
<span class='v EX40_31' data-id='EX40_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and Moses and Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX40_33' data-id='EX40_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and put up the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. And so Moses finished the work. </span></div>
