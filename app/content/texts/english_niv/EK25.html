<span class='v EK25_3' data-id='EK25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Because you said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste and over the people of Judah when they went into exile, </span>
<span class='v EK25_4' data-id='EK25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>therefore I am going to give you to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps and pitch their tents among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk. </span>

<span class='v EK25_6' data-id='EK25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, rejoicing with all the malice of your heart against the land of Israel, </span>
<span class='v EK25_7' data-id='EK25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>therefore I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations.
