<span class='v HB5_2' data-id='HB5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he himself is subject to weakness. </span>
<span class='v HB5_3' data-id='HB5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people. </span>
<span class='v HB5_4' data-id='HB5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And no one takes this honor on himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was. </span></div>

<span class='v HB5_7' data-id='HB5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with fervent cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. </span>
<span class='v HB5_8' data-id='HB5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered </span>
