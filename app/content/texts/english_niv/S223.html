<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_9' data-id='S223_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. As one of the three mighty warriors, he was with David when they taunted the Philistines gathered at Pas Dammim<span class='note' id='footnote-821'><a href='#note-821' class='key'>§</a></span> for battle. Then the Israelites retreated, </span>
<span class='v S223_10' data-id='S223_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but Eleazar stood his ground and struck down the Philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> brought about a great victory that day. The troops returned to Eleazar, but only to strip the dead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_11' data-id='S223_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Next to him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. When the Philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils, Israel’s troops fled from them. </span>
<span class='v S223_12' data-id='S223_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field. He defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> brought about a great victory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_13' data-id='S223_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>During harvest time, three of the thirty chief warriors came down to David at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v S223_14' data-id='S223_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. </span>
<span class='v S223_15' data-id='S223_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” </span>
<span class='v S223_16' data-id='S223_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So the three mighty warriors broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David.
