<span class='v DN12_1' data-id='DN12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then. But at that time your people—everyone whose name is found written in the book—will be delivered. </span>
<span class='v DN12_2' data-id='DN12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt. </span>

<span class='v DN12_4' data-id='DN12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you, Daniel, roll up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end. Many will go here and there to increase knowledge.” </span></div>

<span class='v DN12_5' data-id='DN12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I, Daniel, looked, and there before me stood two others, one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank. </span>
<span class='v DN12_6' data-id='DN12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>One of them said to the man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled?” </span></div>

<span class='v DN12_7' data-id='DN12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The man clothed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and I heard him swear by him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times and half a time.<span class='note' id='footnote-2266'><a href='#note-2266' class='key'>†</a></span> When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.” </span></div>

<span class='v DN12_8' data-id='DN12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I heard, but I did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will the outcome of all this be?” </span></div>

<span class='v DN12_9' data-id='DN12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He replied, “Go your way, Daniel, because the words are rolled up and sealed until the time of the end. </span>
<span class='v DN12_10' data-id='DN12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Many will be purified, made spotless and refined, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. None of the wicked will understand, but those who are wise will understand. </span></div>
