<div class='s'>Cornelius Calls for Peter </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_1' data-id='AC10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment. </span>
<span class='v AC10_2' data-id='AC10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He and all his family were devout and God-fearing; he gave generously to those in need and prayed to God regularly. </span>
<span class='v AC10_3' data-id='AC10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>One day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision. He distinctly saw an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_4' data-id='AC10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Cornelius stared at him in fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_4' data-id='AC10_4'>The angel answered, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before God. </span>
<span class='v AC10_5' data-id='AC10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is called Peter. </span>
<span class='v AC10_6' data-id='AC10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is staying with Simon the tanner, whose house is by the sea.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_7' data-id='AC10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the angel who spoke to him had gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants. </span>
<span class='v AC10_8' data-id='AC10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He told them everything that had happened and sent them to Joppa. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter’s Vision </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_9' data-id='AC10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>About noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. </span>
<span class='v AC10_10' data-id='AC10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He became hungry and wanted something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance. </span>
<span class='v AC10_11' data-id='AC10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners. </span>
<span class='v AC10_12' data-id='AC10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It contained all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds. </span>
<span class='v AC10_13' data-id='AC10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then a voice told him, <span class='wj'>“Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_14' data-id='AC10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Surely not, Lord!” Peter replied. “I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_15' data-id='AC10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The voice spoke to him a second time, <span class='wj'>“Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_16' data-id='AC10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>This happened three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_17' data-id='AC10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found out where Simon’s house was and stopped at the gate. </span>
<span class='v AC10_18' data-id='AC10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They called out, asking if Simon who was known as Peter was staying there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_19' data-id='AC10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Simon, three<span class='note' id='footnote-2813'><a href='#note-2813' class='key'>*</a></span> men are looking for you. </span>
<span class='v AC10_20' data-id='AC10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So get up and go downstairs. Do not hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_21' data-id='AC10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Peter went down and said to the men, “I’m the one you’re looking for. Why have you come?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_22' data-id='AC10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The men replied, “We have come from Cornelius the centurion. He is a righteous and God-fearing man, who is respected by all the Jewish people. A holy angel told him to ask you to come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say.” </span>
<span class='v AC10_23' data-id='AC10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Peter invited the men into the house to be his guests. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v AC10_23' data-id='AC10_23'>Peter at Cornelius’s House </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_23' data-id='AC10_23'>The next day Peter started out with them, and some of the believers from Joppa went along. </span>
<span class='v AC10_24' data-id='AC10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The following day he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. </span>
<span class='v AC10_25' data-id='AC10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence. </span>
<span class='v AC10_26' data-id='AC10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Peter made him get up. “Stand up,” he said, “I am only a man myself.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_27' data-id='AC10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>While talking with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people. </span>
<span class='v AC10_28' data-id='AC10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>He said to them: “You are well aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean. </span>
<span class='v AC10_29' data-id='AC10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I ask why you sent for me?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_30' data-id='AC10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Cornelius answered: “Three days ago I was in my house praying at this hour, at three in the afternoon. Suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me </span>
<span class='v AC10_31' data-id='AC10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor. </span>
<span class='v AC10_32' data-id='AC10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter. He is a guest in the home of Simon the tanner, who lives by the sea.’ </span>
<span class='v AC10_33' data-id='AC10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_34' data-id='AC10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then Peter began to speak: “I now realize how true it is that God does not show favoritism </span>
<span class='v AC10_35' data-id='AC10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and does what is right. </span>
<span class='v AC10_36' data-id='AC10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>You know the message God sent to the people of Israel, announcing the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all. </span>
<span class='v AC10_37' data-id='AC10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>You know what has happened throughout the province of Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached— </span>
<span class='v AC10_38' data-id='AC10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil, because God was with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_39' data-id='AC10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>“We are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a cross, </span>
<span class='v AC10_40' data-id='AC10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>but God raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen. </span>
<span class='v AC10_41' data-id='AC10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He was not seen by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. </span>
<span class='v AC10_42' data-id='AC10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead. </span>
<span class='v AC10_43' data-id='AC10_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_44' data-id='AC10_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. </span>
<span class='v AC10_45' data-id='AC10_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v AC10_46' data-id='AC10_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>For they heard them speaking in tongues<span class='note' id='footnote-2814'><a href='#note-2814' class='key'>†</a></span> and praising God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC10_46' data-id='AC10_46'>Then Peter said, </span>
<span class='v AC10_47' data-id='AC10_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>“Surely no one can stand in the way of their being baptized with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.” </span>
<span class='v AC10_48' data-id='AC10_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days. </span></div></div>
