<div class='s'>Israel Rebels Against Rehoboam </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_1' data-id='R210_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had gone there to make him king. </span>
<span class='v R210_2' data-id='R210_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard this (he was in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon), he returned from Egypt. </span>
<span class='v R210_3' data-id='R210_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So they sent for Jeroboam, and he and all Israel went to Rehoboam and said to him: </span>
<span class='v R210_4' data-id='R210_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_5' data-id='R210_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people went away. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_6' data-id='R210_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then King Rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon during his lifetime. “How would you advise me to answer these people?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_7' data-id='R210_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They replied, “If you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your servants.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_8' data-id='R210_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him. </span>
<span class='v R210_9' data-id='R210_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who say to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_10' data-id='R210_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The young men who had grown up with him replied, “The people have said to you, ‘Your father put a heavy yoke on us, but make our yoke lighter.’ Now tell them, ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. </span>
<span class='v R210_11' data-id='R210_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My father laid on you a heavy yoke; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_12' data-id='R210_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam, as the king had said, “Come back to me in three days.” </span>
<span class='v R210_13' data-id='R210_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The king answered them harshly. Rejecting the advice of the elders, </span>
<span class='v R210_14' data-id='R210_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>he followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father made your yoke heavy; I will make it even heavier. My father scourged you with whips; I will scourge you with scorpions.” </span>
<span class='v R210_15' data-id='R210_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the king did not listen to the people, for this turn of events was from God, to fulfill the word the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had spoken to Jeroboam son of Nebat through Ahijah the Shilonite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, they answered the king: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'>“What share do we have in David, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'>what part in Jesse’s son? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'>To your tents, Israel! </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'>Look after your own house, David!” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v R210_16' data-id='R210_16'>So all the Israelites went home. </span>
<span class='v R210_17' data-id='R210_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But as for the Israelites who were living in the towns of Judah, Rehoboam still ruled over them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R210_18' data-id='R210_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>King Rehoboam sent out Adoniram,<span class='note' id='footnote-1168'><a href='#note-1168' class='key'>*</a></span> who was in charge of forced labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death. King Rehoboam, however, managed to get into his chariot and escape to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R210_19' data-id='R210_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. </span></div></div>
