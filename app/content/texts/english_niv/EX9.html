<div class='s'>The Plague on Livestock </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_1' data-id='EX9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, so that they may worship me.” </span>
<span class='v EX9_2' data-id='EX9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, </span>
<span class='v EX9_3' data-id='EX9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>the hand of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, sheep and goats. </span>
<span class='v EX9_4' data-id='EX9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_5' data-id='EX9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> set a time and said, “Tomorrow the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will do this in the land.” </span>
<span class='v EX9_6' data-id='EX9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the next day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. </span>
<span class='v EX9_7' data-id='EX9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plague of Boils </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_8' data-id='EX9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. </span>
<span class='v EX9_9' data-id='EX9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_10' data-id='EX9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. </span>
<span class='v EX9_11' data-id='EX9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the Egyptians. </span>
<span class='v EX9_12' data-id='EX9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> hardened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said to Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plague of Hail </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_13' data-id='EX9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning, confront Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me, </span>
<span class='v EX9_14' data-id='EX9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. </span>
<span class='v EX9_15' data-id='EX9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. </span>
<span class='v EX9_16' data-id='EX9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But I have raised you up<span class='note' id='footnote-242'><a href='#note-242' class='key'>*</a></span> for this very purpose, that I might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth. </span>
<span class='v EX9_17' data-id='EX9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. </span>
<span class='v EX9_18' data-id='EX9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Therefore, at this time tomorrow I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded till now. </span>
<span class='v EX9_19' data-id='EX9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field, and they will die.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_20' data-id='EX9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Those officials of Pharaoh who feared the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside. </span>
<span class='v EX9_21' data-id='EX9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But those who ignored the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> left their slaves and livestock in the field. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_22' data-id='EX9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over Egypt—on people and animals and on everything growing in the fields of Egypt.” </span>
<span class='v EX9_23' data-id='EX9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> rained hail on the land of Egypt; </span>
<span class='v EX9_24' data-id='EX9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth. It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. </span>
<span class='v EX9_25' data-id='EX9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Throughout Egypt hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree. </span>
<span class='v EX9_26' data-id='EX9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_27' data-id='EX9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong. </span>
<span class='v EX9_28' data-id='EX9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for we have had enough thunder and hail. I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_29' data-id='EX9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Moses replied, “When I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands in prayer to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. The thunder will stop and there will be no more hail, so you may know that the earth is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s. </span>
<span class='v EX9_30' data-id='EX9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_31' data-id='EX9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>(The flax and barley were destroyed, since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom. </span>
<span class='v EX9_32' data-id='EX9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The wheat and spelt, however, were not destroyed, because they ripen later.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX9_33' data-id='EX9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands toward the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; the thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured down on the land. </span>
<span class='v EX9_34' data-id='EX9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: He and his officials hardened their hearts. </span>
<span class='v EX9_35' data-id='EX9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not let the Israelites go, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said through Moses. </span></div></div>
