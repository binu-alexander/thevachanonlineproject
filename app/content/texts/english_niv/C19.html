<div class='s'>Paul’s Rights as an Apostle </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_1' data-id='C19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not the result of my work in the Lord? </span>
<span class='v C19_2' data-id='C19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Even though I may not be an apostle to others, surely I am to you! For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_3' data-id='C19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me. </span>
<span class='v C19_4' data-id='C19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Don’t we have the right to food and drink? </span>
<span class='v C19_5' data-id='C19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Don’t we have the right to take a believing wife along with us, as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas<span class='note' id='footnote-2979'><a href='#note-2979' class='key'>*</a></span>? </span>
<span class='v C19_6' data-id='C19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Or is it only I and Barnabas who lack the right to not work for a living? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_7' data-id='C19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its grapes? Who tends a flock and does not drink the milk? </span>
<span class='v C19_8' data-id='C19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Do I say this merely on human authority? Doesn’t the Law say the same thing? </span>
<span class='v C19_9' data-id='C19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For it is written in the Law of Moses: “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2980'><a href='#note-2980' class='key'>†</a></span> Is it about oxen that God is concerned? </span>
<span class='v C19_10' data-id='C19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Surely he says this for us, doesn’t he? Yes, this was written for us, because whoever plows and threshes should be able to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest. </span>
<span class='v C19_11' data-id='C19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you? </span>
<span class='v C19_12' data-id='C19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If others have this right of support from you, shouldn’t we have it all the more? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_12' data-id='C19_12'>But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_13' data-id='C19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? </span>
<span class='v C19_14' data-id='C19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_15' data-id='C19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me, for I would rather die than allow anyone to deprive me of this boast. </span>
<span class='v C19_16' data-id='C19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For when I preach the gospel, I cannot boast, since I am compelled to preach. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! </span>
<span class='v C19_17' data-id='C19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If I preach voluntarily, I have a reward; if not voluntarily, I am simply discharging the trust committed to me. </span>
<span class='v C19_18' data-id='C19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>What then is my reward? Just this: that in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, and so not make full use of my rights as a preacher of the gospel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul’s Use of His Freedom </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_19' data-id='C19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. </span>
<span class='v C19_20' data-id='C19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. </span>
<span class='v C19_21' data-id='C19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. </span>
<span class='v C19_22' data-id='C19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. </span>
<span class='v C19_23' data-id='C19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Need for Self-Discipline </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C19_24' data-id='C19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize. </span>
<span class='v C19_25' data-id='C19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever. </span>
<span class='v C19_26' data-id='C19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Therefore I do not run like someone running aimlessly; I do not fight like a boxer beating the air. </span>
<span class='v C19_27' data-id='C19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>No, I strike a blow to my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize. </span></div></div>
