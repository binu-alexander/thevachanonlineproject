<div class='s'>The Good Shepherd and His Sheep </div>

<span class='v JN10_1' data-id='JN10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you Pharisees, anyone who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a robber.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_2' data-id='JN10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_3' data-id='JN10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_4' data-id='JN10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_5' data-id='JN10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not recognize a stranger’s voice.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_6' data-id='JN10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jesus used this figure of speech, but the Pharisees did not understand what he was telling them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_7' data-id='JN10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore Jesus said again, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_8' data-id='JN10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>All who have come before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep have not listened to them.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_9' data-id='JN10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2739'><a href='#note-2739' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>They will come in and go out, and find pasture.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_10' data-id='JN10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_11' data-id='JN10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_12' data-id='JN10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_13' data-id='JN10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.</span></span></div>

<span class='v JN10_14' data-id='JN10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me—</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_15' data-id='JN10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_16' data-id='JN10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_17' data-id='JN10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_18' data-id='JN10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my Father.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_19' data-id='JN10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Jews who heard these words were again divided. </span>
<span class='v JN10_20' data-id='JN10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Many of them said, “He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_21' data-id='JN10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But others said, “These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Further Conflict Over Jesus’ Claims </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_22' data-id='JN10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then came the Festival of Dedication<span class='note' id='footnote-2740'><a href='#note-2740' class='key'>†</a></span> at Jerusalem. It was winter, </span>
<span class='v JN10_23' data-id='JN10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. </span>
<span class='v JN10_24' data-id='JN10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_25' data-id='JN10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“I did tell you, but you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me, </span></span>
<span class='v JN10_26' data-id='JN10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>but you do not believe because you are not my sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_27' data-id='JN10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_28' data-id='JN10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span></span>

<span class='v JN10_30' data-id='JN10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I and the Father are one.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_31' data-id='JN10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, </span>
<span class='v JN10_32' data-id='JN10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>but Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_33' data-id='JN10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_34' data-id='JN10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods” ’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2742'><a href='#note-2742' class='key'>§</a></span><span class='wj'>?</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_35' data-id='JN10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_36' data-id='JN10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_37' data-id='JN10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father.</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_38' data-id='JN10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN10_39' data-id='JN10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped their grasp. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_40' data-id='JN10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing in the early days. There he stayed, </span>
<span class='v JN10_41' data-id='JN10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>and many people came to him. They said, “Though John never performed a sign, all that John said about this man was true.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_42' data-id='JN10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And in that place many believed in Jesus. </span></div></div>
