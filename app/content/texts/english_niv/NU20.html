<div class='s'>Water From the Rock </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_1' data-id='NU20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_2' data-id='NU20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron. </span>
<span class='v NU20_3' data-id='NU20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>! </span>
<span class='v NU20_4' data-id='NU20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Why did you bring the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here? </span>
<span class='v NU20_5' data-id='NU20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain or figs, grapevines or pomegranates. And there is no water to drink!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_6' data-id='NU20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown, and the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to them. </span>
<span class='v NU20_7' data-id='NU20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU20_8' data-id='NU20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water. You will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_9' data-id='NU20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Moses took the staff from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s presence, just as he commanded him. </span>
<span class='v NU20_10' data-id='NU20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” </span>
<span class='v NU20_11' data-id='NU20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_12' data-id='NU20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_13' data-id='NU20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>These were the waters of Meribah,<span class='note' id='footnote-461'><a href='#note-461' class='key'>*</a></span> where the Israelites quarreled with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and where he was proved holy among them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Edom Denies Israel Passage </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_14' data-id='NU20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_14' data-id='NU20_14'>“This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships that have come on us. </span>
<span class='v NU20_15' data-id='NU20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Our ancestors went down into Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors, </span>
<span class='v NU20_16' data-id='NU20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>but when we cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_16' data-id='NU20_16'>“Now we are here at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory. </span>
<span class='v NU20_17' data-id='NU20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Please let us pass through your country. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_18' data-id='NU20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Edom answered: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_18' data-id='NU20_18'>“You may not pass through here; if you try, we will march out and attack you with the sword.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_19' data-id='NU20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Israelites replied: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_19' data-id='NU20_19'>“We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to pass through on foot—nothing else.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_20' data-id='NU20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Again they answered: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_20' data-id='NU20_20'>“You may not pass through.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_20' data-id='NU20_20'>Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army. </span>
<span class='v NU20_21' data-id='NU20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Since Edom refused to let them go through their territory, Israel turned away from them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Aaron </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_22' data-id='NU20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor. </span>
<span class='v NU20_23' data-id='NU20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, </span>
<span class='v NU20_24' data-id='NU20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah. </span>
<span class='v NU20_25' data-id='NU20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Get Aaron and his son Eleazar and take them up Mount Hor. </span>
<span class='v NU20_26' data-id='NU20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU20_27' data-id='NU20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Moses did as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded: They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community. </span>
<span class='v NU20_28' data-id='NU20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. And Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain, </span>
<span class='v NU20_29' data-id='NU20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>and when the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him thirty days. </span></div></div>
