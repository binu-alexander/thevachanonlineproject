<div class='s'>Jesus Teaches Nicodemus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_1' data-id='JN3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a Pharisee, a man named Nicodemus who was a member of the Jewish ruling council. </span>
<span class='v JN3_2' data-id='JN3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He came to Jesus at night and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_3' data-id='JN3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2713'><a href='#note-2713' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_4' data-id='JN3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_5' data-id='JN3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit.</span></span>
<span class='v JN3_6' data-id='JN3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2714'><a href='#note-2714' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>gives birth to spirit.</span></span>
<span class='v JN3_7' data-id='JN3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2715'><a href='#note-2715' class='key'>‡</a></span><span class='wj'>must be born again.’ </span></span>
<span class='v JN3_8' data-id='JN3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2716'><a href='#note-2716' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_9' data-id='JN3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“How can this be?” Nicodemus asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_10' data-id='JN3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You are Israel’s teacher,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“and do you not understand these things?</span></span>
<span class='v JN3_11' data-id='JN3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Very truly I tell you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but still you people do not accept our testimony.</span></span>
<span class='v JN3_12' data-id='JN3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how then will you believe if I speak of heavenly things?</span></span>
<span class='v JN3_13' data-id='JN3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven—the Son of Man.</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2717'><a href='#note-2717' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN3_14' data-id='JN3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2718'><a href='#note-2718' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN3_15' data-id='JN3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2719'><a href='#note-2719' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_16' data-id='JN3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. </span>
<span class='v JN3_17' data-id='JN3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. </span>
<span class='v JN3_18' data-id='JN3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. </span>
<span class='v JN3_19' data-id='JN3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. </span>
<span class='v JN3_20' data-id='JN3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. </span>
<span class='v JN3_21' data-id='JN3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_22' data-id='JN3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus and his disciples went out into the Judean countryside, where he spent some time with them, and baptized. </span>
<span class='v JN3_23' data-id='JN3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptized. </span>
<span class='v JN3_24' data-id='JN3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>(This was before John was put in prison.) </span>
<span class='v JN3_25' data-id='JN3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>An argument developed between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over the matter of ceremonial washing. </span>
<span class='v JN3_26' data-id='JN3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan—the one you testified about—look, he is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_27' data-id='JN3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>To this John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven. </span>
