<span class='v ML3_3' data-id='ML3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver; he will purify the Levites and refine them like gold and silver. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness, </span>
<span class='v ML3_4' data-id='ML3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, as in days gone by, as in former years. </span></div>

<span class='v ML3_5' data-id='ML3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“So I will come to put you on trial. I will be quick to testify against sorcerers, adulterers and perjurers, against those who defraud laborers of their wages, who oppress the widows and the fatherless, and deprive the foreigners among you of justice, but do not fear me,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>

<span class='v ML3_11' data-id='ML3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I will prevent pests from devouring your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span>
<span class='v ML3_12' data-id='ML3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Then all the nations will call you blessed, for yours will be a delightful land,” says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>
