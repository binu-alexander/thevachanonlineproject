<span class='v T21_1' data-id='T21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, in keeping with the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_2' data-id='T21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>To Timothy, my dear son: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_2' data-id='T21_2'>Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Thanksgiving </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_3' data-id='T21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I thank God, whom I serve, as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience, as night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers. </span>
<span class='v T21_4' data-id='T21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Recalling your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. </span>
<span class='v T21_5' data-id='T21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, now lives in you also. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Appeal for Loyalty to Paul and the Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_6' data-id='T21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands. </span>
<span class='v T21_7' data-id='T21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. </span>
<span class='v T21_8' data-id='T21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me his prisoner. Rather, join with me in suffering for the gospel, by the power of God. </span>
<span class='v T21_9' data-id='T21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He has saved us and called us to a holy life—not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, </span>
<span class='v T21_10' data-id='T21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel. </span>
<span class='v T21_11' data-id='T21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And of this gospel I was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher. </span>
<span class='v T21_12' data-id='T21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>That is why I am suffering as I am. Yet this is no cause for shame, because I know whom I have believed, and am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_13' data-id='T21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>What you heard from me, keep as the pattern of sound teaching, with faith and love in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T21_14' data-id='T21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you—guard it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Examples of Disloyalty and Loyalty </div>

<span class='v T21_15' data-id='T21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You know that everyone in the province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_16' data-id='T21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord show mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains. </span>
<span class='v T21_17' data-id='T21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, when he was in Rome, he searched hard for me until he found me. </span>
<span class='v T21_18' data-id='T21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>May the Lord grant that he will find mercy from the Lord on that day! You know very well in how many ways he helped me in Ephesus. </span></div></div>
