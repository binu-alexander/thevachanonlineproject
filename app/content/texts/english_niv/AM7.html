<div class='s'>Locusts, Fire and a Plumb Line </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_1' data-id='AM7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> showed me: He was preparing swarms of locusts after the king’s share had been harvested and just as the late crops were coming up. </span>
<span class='v AM7_2' data-id='AM7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When they had stripped the land clean, I cried out, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, forgive! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_3' data-id='AM7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> relented. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_3' data-id='AM7_3'>“This will not happen,” the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_4' data-id='AM7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> showed me: The Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was calling for judgment by fire; it dried up the great deep and devoured the land. </span>
<span class='v AM7_5' data-id='AM7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I cried out, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I beg you, stop! How can Jacob survive? He is so small!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_6' data-id='AM7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> relented. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_6' data-id='AM7_6'>“This will not happen either,” the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_7' data-id='AM7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb,<span class='note' id='footnote-2330'><a href='#note-2330' class='key'>*</a></span> with a plumb line<span class='note' id='footnote-2331'><a href='#note-2331' class='key'>†</a></span> in his hand. </span>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'>“A plumb line,” I replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'>Then the Lord said, “Look, I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel; I will spare them no longer. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_9' data-id='AM7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“The high places of Isaac will be destroyed </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_9' data-id='AM7_9'>and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_9' data-id='AM7_9'>with my sword I will rise against the house of Jeroboam.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Amos and Amaziah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_10' data-id='AM7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words. </span>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For this is what Amos is saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'>“ ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'>and Israel will surely go into exile, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'>away from their native land.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_12' data-id='AM7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Get out, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Earn your bread there and do your prophesying there. </span>
<span class='v AM7_13' data-id='AM7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Don’t prophesy anymore at Bethel, because this is the king’s sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_14' data-id='AM7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Amos answered Amaziah, “I was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but I was a shepherd, and I also took care of sycamore-fig trees. </span>
<span class='v AM7_15' data-id='AM7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> took me from tending the flock and said to me, ‘Go, prophesy to my people Israel.’ </span>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now then, hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. You say, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'>“ ‘Do not prophesy against Israel, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'>and stop preaching against the descendants of Isaac.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AM7_17' data-id='AM7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v AM7_17' data-id='AM7_17'>Your land will be measured and divided up, </span></div>
