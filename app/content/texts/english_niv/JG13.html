<div class='s'>The Birth of Samson </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_1' data-id='JG13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, so the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_2' data-id='JG13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the clan of the Danites, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth. </span>
<span class='v JG13_3' data-id='JG13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to her and said, “You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son. </span>
<span class='v JG13_4' data-id='JG13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean. </span>
<span class='v JG13_5' data-id='JG13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_6' data-id='JG13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the woman went to her husband and told him, “A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name. </span>
<span class='v JG13_7' data-id='JG13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and have a son. Now then, drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_8' data-id='JG13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Manoah prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: “Pardon your servant, Lord. I beg you to let the man of God you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_9' data-id='JG13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field; but her husband Manoah was not with her. </span>
<span class='v JG13_10' data-id='JG13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The woman hurried to tell her husband, “He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_11' data-id='JG13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who talked to my wife?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_11' data-id='JG13_11'>“I am,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_12' data-id='JG13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_13' data-id='JG13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered, “Your wife must do all that I have told her. </span>
<span class='v JG13_14' data-id='JG13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_15' data-id='JG13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Manoah said to the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_16' data-id='JG13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> replied, “Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” (Manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_17' data-id='JG13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your word comes true?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_18' data-id='JG13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He replied, “Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.<span class='note' id='footnote-635'><a href='#note-635' class='key'>*</a></span>” </span>
<span class='v JG13_19' data-id='JG13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering, and sacrificed it on a rock to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched: </span>
<span class='v JG13_20' data-id='JG13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground. </span>
<span class='v JG13_21' data-id='JG13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realized that it was the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_22' data-id='JG13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_23' data-id='JG13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But his wife answered, “If the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or now told us this.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG13_24' data-id='JG13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson. He grew and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> blessed him, </span>
<span class='v JG13_25' data-id='JG13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. </span></div></div>
