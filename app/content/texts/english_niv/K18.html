<div class='s'>The Ark Brought to the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_1' data-id='K18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then King Solomon summoned into his presence at Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant from Zion, the City of David. </span>
<span class='v K18_2' data-id='K18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>All the Israelites came together to King Solomon at the time of the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_3' data-id='K18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the priests took up the ark, </span>
<span class='v K18_4' data-id='K18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and they brought up the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The priests and Levites carried them up, </span>
<span class='v K18_5' data-id='K18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_6' data-id='K18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The priests then brought the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. </span>
<span class='v K18_7' data-id='K18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles. </span>
<span class='v K18_8' data-id='K18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Holy Place in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. </span>
<span class='v K18_9' data-id='K18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_10' data-id='K18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When the priests withdrew from the Holy Place, the cloud filled the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K18_11' data-id='K18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> filled his temple. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_12' data-id='K18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon said, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud; </span>
<span class='v K18_13' data-id='K18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I have indeed built a magnificent temple for you, a place for you to dwell forever.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_14' data-id='K18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>While the whole assembly of Israel was standing there, the king turned around and blessed them. </span>
<span class='v K18_15' data-id='K18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then he said: </span></div>

<span class='v K18_15' data-id='K18_15'>“Praise be to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father David. For he said, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_17' data-id='K18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“My father David had it in his heart to build a temple for the Name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K18_18' data-id='K18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to my father David, ‘You did well to have it in your heart to build a temple for my Name. </span>
<span class='v K18_19' data-id='K18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, you are not the one to build the temple, but your son, your own flesh and blood—he is the one who will build the temple for my Name.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_20' data-id='K18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has kept the promise he made: I have succeeded David my father and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> promised, and I have built the temple for the Name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K18_21' data-id='K18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I have provided a place there for the ark, in which is the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that he made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon’s Prayer of Dedication </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_22' data-id='K18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in front of the whole assembly of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven </span>
<span class='v K18_23' data-id='K18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and said: </span></div>

<span class='v K18_55' data-id='K18_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>He stood and blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice, saying: </span></div>

<div class='s'>The Dedication of the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_62' data-id='K18_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K18_63' data-id='K18_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: twenty-two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_64' data-id='K18_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>On that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and there he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings, because the bronze altar that stood before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was too small to hold the burnt offerings, the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_65' data-id='K18_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon observed the festival at that time, and all Israel with him—a vast assembly, people from Lebo Hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. They celebrated it before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God for seven days and seven days more, fourteen days in all. </span>
<span class='v K18_66' data-id='K18_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>On the following day he sent the people away. They blessed the king and then went home, joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had done for his servant David and his people Israel. </span></div></div>
