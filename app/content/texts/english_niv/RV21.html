<div class='s'>A New Heaven and a New Earth </div>

<span class='v RV21_1' data-id='RV21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3311'><a href='#note-3311' class='key'>*</a></span> for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. </span>
<span class='v RV21_2' data-id='RV21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. </span>
<span class='v RV21_3' data-id='RV21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. </span>
<span class='v RV21_4' data-id='RV21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’<span class='note' id='footnote-3312'><a href='#note-3312' class='key'>†</a></span> or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_5' data-id='RV21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_6' data-id='RV21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. </span>
<span class='v RV21_7' data-id='RV21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. </span>
<span class='v RV21_8' data-id='RV21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_9' data-id='RV21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” </span>
<span class='v RV21_10' data-id='RV21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. </span>
<span class='v RV21_11' data-id='RV21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. </span>
<span class='v RV21_12' data-id='RV21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class='v RV21_13' data-id='RV21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west. </span>
<span class='v RV21_14' data-id='RV21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_15' data-id='RV21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls. </span>
<span class='v RV21_16' data-id='RV21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia<span class='note' id='footnote-3313'><a href='#note-3313' class='key'>‡</a></span> in length, and as wide and high as it is long. </span>
<span class='v RV21_17' data-id='RV21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-3314'><a href='#note-3314' class='key'>§</a></span> thick.<span class='note' id='footnote-3315'><a href='#note-3315' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v RV21_18' data-id='RV21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass. </span>
<span class='v RV21_19' data-id='RV21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, </span>
<span class='v RV21_20' data-id='RV21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.<span class='note' id='footnote-3316'><a href='#note-3316' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v RV21_21' data-id='RV21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_22' data-id='RV21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. </span>
<span class='v RV21_23' data-id='RV21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp. </span>
<span class='v RV21_24' data-id='RV21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it. </span>
<span class='v RV21_25' data-id='RV21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. </span>
<span class='v RV21_26' data-id='RV21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. </span>
<span class='v RV21_27' data-id='RV21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life. </span></div></div>
