<div class='s'>Faith or Works of the Law </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_1' data-id='GL3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified. </span>
<span class='v GL3_2' data-id='GL3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by believing what you heard? </span>
<span class='v GL3_3' data-id='GL3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Are you so foolish? After beginning by means of the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by means of the flesh?<span class='note' id='footnote-3044'><a href='#note-3044' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_4' data-id='GL3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Have you experienced<span class='note' id='footnote-3045'><a href='#note-3045' class='key'>†</a></span> so much in vain—if it really was in vain? </span>
<span class='v GL3_5' data-id='GL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So again I ask, does God give you his Spirit and work miracles among you by the works of the law, or by your believing what you heard? </span>
<span class='v GL3_6' data-id='GL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So also Abraham “believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3046'><a href='#note-3046' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_7' data-id='GL3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GL3_8' data-id='GL3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3047'><a href='#note-3047' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_9' data-id='GL3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So those who rely on faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_10' data-id='GL3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3048'><a href='#note-3048' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_11' data-id='GL3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Clearly no one who relies on the law is justified before God, because “the righteous will live by faith.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3049'><a href='#note-3049' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_12' data-id='GL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The law is not based on faith; on the contrary, it says, “The person who does these things will live by them.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3050'><a href='#note-3050' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_13' data-id='GL3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3051'><a href='#note-3051' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL3_14' data-id='GL3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Law and the Promise </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_15' data-id='GL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Brothers and sisters, let me take an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established, so it is in this case. </span>
<span class='v GL3_16' data-id='GL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many people, but “and to your seed,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3052'><a href='#note-3052' class='key'>*</a></span> meaning one person, who is Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_17' data-id='GL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>What I mean is this: The law, introduced 430 years later, does not set aside the covenant previously established by God and thus do away with the promise. </span>
<span class='v GL3_18' data-id='GL3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on the promise; but God in his grace gave it to Abraham through a promise. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_19' data-id='GL3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Why, then, was the law given at all? It was added because of transgressions until the Seed to whom the promise referred had come. The law was given through angels and entrusted to a mediator. </span>
<span class='v GL3_20' data-id='GL3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>A mediator, however, implies more than one party; but God is one. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_21' data-id='GL3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Is the law, therefore, opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. </span>
<span class='v GL3_22' data-id='GL3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Children of God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_23' data-id='GL3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Before the coming of this faith,<span class='note' id='footnote-3053'><a href='#note-3053' class='key'>†</a></span> we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed. </span>
<span class='v GL3_24' data-id='GL3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith. </span>
<span class='v GL3_25' data-id='GL3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now that this faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL3_26' data-id='GL3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, </span>
<span class='v GL3_27' data-id='GL3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL3_28' data-id='GL3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v GL3_29' data-id='GL3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise. </span></div></div>
