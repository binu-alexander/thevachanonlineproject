<span class='v JS6_1' data-id='JS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the gates of Jericho were securely barred because of the Israelites. No one went out and no one came in. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_2' data-id='JS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Joshua, “See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. </span>
<span class='v JS6_3' data-id='JS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. </span>
<span class='v JS6_4' data-id='JS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. </span>
<span class='v JS6_5' data-id='JS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone straight in.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_6' data-id='JS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.” </span>
<span class='v JS6_7' data-id='JS6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he ordered the army, “Advance! March around the city, with an armed guard going ahead of the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_8' data-id='JS6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant followed them. </span>
<span class='v JS6_9' data-id='JS6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. </span>
<span class='v JS6_10' data-id='JS6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But Joshua had commanded the army, “Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!” </span>
<span class='v JS6_11' data-id='JS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So he had the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> carried around the city, circling it once. Then the army returned to camp and spent the night there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_12' data-id='JS6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JS6_13' data-id='JS6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, while the trumpets kept sounding. </span>
<span class='v JS6_14' data-id='JS6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_15' data-id='JS6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. </span>
<span class='v JS6_16' data-id='JS6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the army, “Shout! For the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given you the city! </span>
<span class='v JS6_17' data-id='JS6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The city and all that is in it are to be devoted<span class='note' id='footnote-564'><a href='#note-564' class='key'>*</a></span> to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent. </span>
<span class='v JS6_18' data-id='JS6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. </span>
<span class='v JS6_19' data-id='JS6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and must go into his treasury.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_20' data-id='JS6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. </span>
<span class='v JS6_21' data-id='JS6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They devoted the city to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_22' data-id='JS6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.” </span>
<span class='v JS6_23' data-id='JS6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother, her brothers and sisters and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_24' data-id='JS6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s house. </span>
<span class='v JS6_25' data-id='JS6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the men Joshua had sent as spies to Jericho—and she lives among the Israelites to this day. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'>“At the cost of his firstborn son </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'>he will lay its foundations; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'>at the cost of his youngest </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'>he will set up its gates.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS6_27' data-id='JS6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout the land. </span></div></div>
