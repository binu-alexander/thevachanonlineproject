<div class='s'>The Parable of the Persistent Widow </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_1' data-id='LK18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up. </span>
<span class='v LK18_2' data-id='LK18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said: <span class='wj'>“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_3' data-id='LK18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_4' data-id='LK18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“For some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or care what people think, </span></span>
<span class='v LK18_5' data-id='LK18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won’t eventually come and attack me!’ ”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_6' data-id='LK18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, <span class='wj'>“Listen to what the unjust judge says.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_7' data-id='LK18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_8' data-id='LK18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_9' data-id='LK18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everyone else, Jesus told this parable: </span>
<span class='v LK18_10' data-id='LK18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_11' data-id='LK18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_12' data-id='LK18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_13' data-id='LK18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_14' data-id='LK18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_15' data-id='LK18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>People were also bringing babies to Jesus for him to place his hands on them. When the disciples saw this, they rebuked them. </span>
<span class='v LK18_16' data-id='LK18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus called the children to him and said, <span class='wj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_17' data-id='LK18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_18' data-id='LK18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>A certain ruler asked him, “Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_19' data-id='LK18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Why do you call me good?”</span> Jesus answered. <span class='wj'>“No one is good—except God alone.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_20' data-id='LK18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2681'><a href='#note-2681' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>”</span></span></div>

<span class='v LK18_21' data-id='LK18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“All these I have kept since I was a boy,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_22' data-id='LK18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, <span class='wj'>“You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_23' data-id='LK18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was very wealthy. </span>
<span class='v LK18_24' data-id='LK18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus looked at him and said, <span class='wj'>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_25' data-id='LK18_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_26' data-id='LK18_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_27' data-id='LK18_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_28' data-id='LK18_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Peter said to him, “We have left all we had to follow you!” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_31' data-id='LK18_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus took the Twelve aside and told them, <span class='wj'>“We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</span></span>
<span class='v LK18_32' data-id='LK18_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He will be delivered over to the Gentiles. They will mock him, insult him and spit on him;</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_34' data-id='LK18_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The disciples did not understand any of this. Its meaning was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_35' data-id='LK18_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. </span>
<span class='v LK18_36' data-id='LK18_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening. </span>
<span class='v LK18_37' data-id='LK18_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_38' data-id='LK18_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span></div>

<span class='v LK18_39' data-id='LK18_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_40' data-id='LK18_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, </span>

<span class='v LK18_43' data-id='LK18_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they also praised God. </span></div></div>
