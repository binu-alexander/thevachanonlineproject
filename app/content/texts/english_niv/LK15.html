<div class='s'>The Parable of the Lost Sheep </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_1' data-id='LK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK15_2' data-id='LK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_3' data-id='LK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them this parable: </span>
<span class='v LK15_4' data-id='LK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_5' data-id='LK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_6' data-id='LK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and goes home. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost sheep.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK15_7' data-id='LK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Lost Coin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_8' data-id='LK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2673'><a href='#note-2673' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_9' data-id='LK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK15_10' data-id='LK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Lost Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_11' data-id='LK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus continued: <span class='wj'>“There was a man who had two sons.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_12' data-id='LK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_13' data-id='LK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_14' data-id='LK15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_15' data-id='LK15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_16' data-id='LK15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_17' data-id='LK15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_18' data-id='LK15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_19' data-id='LK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’ </span></span>
<span class='v LK15_20' data-id='LK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So he got up and went to his father. </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_20' data-id='LK15_20'><span class='wj'>“But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_21' data-id='LK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_22' data-id='LK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_23' data-id='LK15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_24' data-id='LK15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_25' data-id='LK15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_26' data-id='LK15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_27' data-id='LK15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_28' data-id='LK15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_29' data-id='LK15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_30' data-id='LK15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_31' data-id='LK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</span></span>
<span class='v LK15_32' data-id='LK15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ ”</span></span></div></div>
