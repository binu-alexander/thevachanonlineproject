<span class='v C15_1' data-id='C15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father’s wife. </span>
<span class='v C15_2' data-id='C15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this? </span>
<span class='v C15_3' data-id='C15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For my part, even though I am not physically present, I am with you in spirit. As one who is present with you in this way, I have already passed judgment in the name of our Lord Jesus on the one who has been doing this. </span>
<span class='v C15_4' data-id='C15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So when you are assembled and I am with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present, </span>
<span class='v C15_5' data-id='C15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,<span class='note' id='footnote-2968'><a href='#note-2968' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='note' id='footnote-2969'><a href='#note-2969' class='key'>†</a></span> so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C15_6' data-id='C15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? </span>
<span class='v C15_7' data-id='C15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. </span>
<span class='v C15_8' data-id='C15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us keep the Festival, not with the old bread leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C15_9' data-id='C15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— </span>
<span class='v C15_10' data-id='C15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. </span>
<span class='v C15_11' data-id='C15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister<span class='note' id='footnote-2970'><a href='#note-2970' class='key'>‡</a></span> but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler.

<span class='v C15_12' data-id='C15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside? </span>
<span class='v C15_13' data-id='C15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked person from among you.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2971'><a href='#note-2971' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div></div>
