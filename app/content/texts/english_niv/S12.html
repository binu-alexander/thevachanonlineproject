<div class='s'>Hannah’s Prayer </div>

<span class='v S12_1' data-id='S12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Hannah prayed and said: </span></div>

<span class='v S12_11' data-id='S12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy ministered before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> under Eli the priest. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Eli’s Wicked Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_12' data-id='S12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Eli’s sons were scoundrels; they had no regard for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S12_13' data-id='S12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now it was the practice of the priests that, whenever any of the people offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being boiled </span>
<span class='v S12_14' data-id='S12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and would plunge the fork into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot. Whatever the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v S12_15' data-id='S12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come and say to the person who was sacrificing, “Give the priest some meat to roast; he won’t accept boiled meat from you, but only raw.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_16' data-id='S12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the person said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then take whatever you want,” the servant would answer, “No, hand it over now; if you don’t, I’ll take it by force.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_17' data-id='S12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This sin of the young men was very great in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s sight, for they<span class='note' id='footnote-681'><a href='#note-681' class='key'>†</a></span> were treating the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s offering with contempt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_18' data-id='S12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Samuel was ministering before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>—a boy wearing a linen ephod. </span>
<span class='v S12_19' data-id='S12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice. </span>
<span class='v S12_20' data-id='S12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to<span class='note' id='footnote-682'><a href='#note-682' class='key'>‡</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” Then they would go home. </span>
<span class='v S12_21' data-id='S12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was gracious to Hannah; she gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_22' data-id='S12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now Eli, who was very old, heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v S12_23' data-id='S12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? I hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours. </span>
<span class='v S12_24' data-id='S12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s people is not good. </span>
<span class='v S12_25' data-id='S12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>If one person sins against another, God<span class='note' id='footnote-683'><a href='#note-683' class='key'>§</a></span> may mediate for the offender; but if anyone sins against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who will intercede for them?” His sons, however, did not listen to their father’s rebuke, for it was the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s will to put them to death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_26' data-id='S12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and with people. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Prophecy Against the House of Eli </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_27' data-id='S12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Now a man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: ‘Did I not clearly reveal myself to your ancestor’s family when they were in Egypt under Pharaoh? </span>
<span class='v S12_28' data-id='S12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in my presence. I also gave your ancestor’s family all the food offerings presented by the Israelites. </span>
<span class='v S12_29' data-id='S12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Why do you<span class='note' id='footnote-684'><a href='#note-684' class='key'>*</a></span> scorn my sacrifice and offering that I prescribed for my dwelling? Why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people Israel?’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_30' data-id='S12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“Therefore the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I promised that members of your family would minister before me forever.’ But now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> declares: ‘Far be it from me! Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be disdained. </span>
<span class='v S12_31' data-id='S12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The time is coming when I will cut short your strength and the strength of your priestly house, so that no one in it will reach old age, </span>
<span class='v S12_32' data-id='S12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>and you will see distress in my dwelling. Although good will be done to Israel, no one in your family line will ever reach old age. </span>
<span class='v S12_33' data-id='S12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Every one of you that I do not cut off from serving at my altar I will spare only to destroy your sight and sap your strength, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_34' data-id='S12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“ ‘And what happens to your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, will be a sign to you—they will both die on the same day. </span>
<span class='v S12_35' data-id='S12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who will do according to what is in my heart and mind. I will firmly establish his priestly house, and they will minister before my anointed one always. </span>
<span class='v S12_36' data-id='S12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and plead, “Appoint me to some priestly office so I can have food to eat.” ’ ” </span></div></div>
