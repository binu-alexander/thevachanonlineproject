<div class='s'>Jesus Calls His First Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_1' data-id='LK5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret,<span class='note' id='footnote-2644'><a href='#note-2644' class='key'>*</a></span> the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. </span>
<span class='v LK5_2' data-id='LK5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. </span>
<span class='v LK5_3' data-id='LK5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_4' data-id='LK5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, <span class='wj'>“Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_5' data-id='LK5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_6' data-id='LK5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. </span>
<span class='v LK5_7' data-id='LK5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_8' data-id='LK5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” </span>
<span class='v LK5_9' data-id='LK5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, </span>
<span class='v LK5_10' data-id='LK5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_10' data-id='LK5_10'>Then Jesus said to Simon, <span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_11' data-id='LK5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man With Leprosy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_12' data-id='LK5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came along who was covered with leprosy.<span class='note' id='footnote-2645'><a href='#note-2645' class='key'>†</a></span> When he saw Jesus, he fell with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_13' data-id='LK5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. <span class='wj'>“I am willing,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“Be clean!”</span> And immediately the leprosy left him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_14' data-id='LK5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus ordered him, <span class='wj'>“Don’t tell anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_15' data-id='LK5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses. </span>
<span class='v LK5_16' data-id='LK5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_17' data-id='LK5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>One day Jesus was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee and from Judea and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was with Jesus to heal the sick. </span>
<span class='v LK5_18' data-id='LK5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK5_19' data-id='LK5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd, right in front of Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_20' data-id='LK5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw their faith, he said, <span class='wj'>“Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_21' data-id='LK5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_22' data-id='LK5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked, <span class='wj'>“Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_23' data-id='LK5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_24' data-id='LK5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”</span> So he said to the paralyzed man, <span class='wj'>“I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_25' data-id='LK5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Immediately he stood up in front of them, took what he had been lying on and went home praising God. </span>
<span class='v LK5_26' data-id='LK5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen remarkable things today.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_27' data-id='LK5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. <span class='wj'>“Follow me,”</span> Jesus said to him, </span>
<span class='v LK5_28' data-id='LK5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and Levi got up, left everything and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_29' data-id='LK5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them. </span>
<span class='v LK5_30' data-id='LK5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_31' data-id='LK5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_32' data-id='LK5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Questioned About Fasting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_33' data-id='LK5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_34' data-id='LK5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_35' data-id='LK5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them; in those days they will fast.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK5_36' data-id='LK5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>He told them this parable: <span class='wj'>“No one tears a piece out of a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_37' data-id='LK5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined.</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_38' data-id='LK5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>No, new wine must be poured into new wineskins.</span></span>
<span class='v LK5_39' data-id='LK5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And no one after drinking old wine wants the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’ ”</span></span></div></div>
