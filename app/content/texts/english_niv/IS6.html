<div class='s'>Isaiah’s Commission </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_1' data-id='IS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. </span>
<span class='v IS6_2' data-id='IS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. </span>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they were calling to one another: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'>“Holy, holy, holy is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'>the whole earth is full of his glory.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_4' data-id='IS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_5' data-id='IS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_6' data-id='IS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. </span>
<span class='v IS6_7' data-id='IS6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_8' data-id='IS6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_8' data-id='IS6_8'>And I said, “Here am I. Send me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He said, “Go and tell this people: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'>“ ‘Be ever hearing, but never understanding; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'>be ever seeing, but never perceiving.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Make the heart of this people calloused; </span></div>

<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>understand with their hearts, </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I said, “For how long, Lord?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>And he answered: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>“Until the cities lie ruined </span></div>

<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>and without inhabitant, </span></div>
<div class='q'>

<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>and the fields ruined and ravaged, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_12' data-id='IS6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>until the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has sent everyone far away </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And though a tenth remains in the land, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
