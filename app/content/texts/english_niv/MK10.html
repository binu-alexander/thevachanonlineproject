<span class='v MK10_1' data-id='MK10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan. Again crowds of people came to him, and as was his custom, he taught them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_2' data-id='MK10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_4' data-id='MK10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_10' data-id='MK10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. </span>
<span class='v MK10_11' data-id='MK10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He answered, <span class='wj'>“Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</span></span>

<span class='v MK10_13' data-id='MK10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>People were bringing little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them, but the disciples rebuked them. </span>
<span class='v MK10_14' data-id='MK10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span></span>

<span class='v MK10_17' data-id='MK10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” </span></div>

<span class='v MK10_21' data-id='MK10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus looked at him and loved him. <span class='wj'>“One thing you lack,”</span> he said. <span class='wj'>“Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_22' data-id='MK10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_23' data-id='MK10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_24' data-id='MK10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The disciples were amazed at his words.

<span class='v MK10_25' data-id='MK10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_26' data-id='MK10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_27' data-id='MK10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Jesus looked at them and said, <span class='wj'>“With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_28' data-id='MK10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!” </span></div>

<span class='v MK10_32' data-id='MK10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid.

<span class='v MK10_33' data-id='MK10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“We are going up to Jerusalem,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law.

<span class='v MK10_34' data-id='MK10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_35' data-id='MK10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_36' data-id='MK10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_37' data-id='MK10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.” </span></div>

<span class='v MK10_38' data-id='MK10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You don’t know what you are asking,”</span> Jesus said. <span class='wj'>“Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_41' data-id='MK10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>When the ten heard about this, they became indignant with James and John. </span>
<span class='v MK10_42' data-id='MK10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Jesus called them together and said, <span class='wj'>“You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</span></span>
<span class='v MK10_43' data-id='MK10_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, </span></span>

<span class='v MK10_45' data-id='MK10_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Blind Bartimaeus Receives His Sight </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_46' data-id='MK10_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man, Bartimaeus (which means “son of Timaeus”), was sitting by the roadside begging. </span>
<span class='v MK10_47' data-id='MK10_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_48' data-id='MK10_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_49' data-id='MK10_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Jesus stopped and said, <span class='wj'>“Call him.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK10_49' data-id='MK10_49'>So they called to the blind man, “Cheer up! On your feet! He’s calling you.” </span>
<span class='v MK10_50' data-id='MK10_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Throwing his cloak aside, he jumped to his feet and came to Jesus. </span></div>
