<div class='s'>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_1' data-id='LK9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had called the Twelve together, he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases, </span>
<span class='v LK9_2' data-id='LK9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. </span>
<span class='v LK9_3' data-id='LK9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He told them: <span class='wj'>“Take nothing for the journey—no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, no extra shirt.</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_4' data-id='LK9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave that town.</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_5' data-id='LK9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If people do not welcome you, leave their town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_6' data-id='LK9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So they set out and went from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_7' data-id='LK9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on. And he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead, </span>
<span class='v LK9_8' data-id='LK9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life. </span>
<span class='v LK9_9' data-id='LK9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this I hear such things about?” And he tried to see him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_10' data-id='LK9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus what they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called Bethsaida, </span>
<span class='v LK9_11' data-id='LK9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>but the crowds learned about it and followed him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed healing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_12' data-id='LK9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Late in the afternoon the Twelve came to him and said, “Send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging, because we are in a remote place here.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_13' data-id='LK9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“You give them something to eat.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_13' data-id='LK9_13'>They answered, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_14' data-id='LK9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>(About five thousand men were there.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_14' data-id='LK9_14'>But he said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_15' data-id='LK9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The disciples did so, and everyone sat down. </span>
<span class='v LK9_16' data-id='LK9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them. Then he gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people. </span>
<span class='v LK9_17' data-id='LK9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Declares That Jesus Is the Messiah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_18' data-id='LK9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Once when Jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him, he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Who do the crowds say I am?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_19' data-id='LK9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_20' data-id='LK9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“But what about you?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Who do you say I am?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_20' data-id='LK9_20'>Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Predicts His Death </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_21' data-id='LK9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone. </span>
<span class='v LK9_22' data-id='LK9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he said, <span class='wj'>“The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the teachers of the law, and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_23' data-id='LK9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them all: <span class='wj'>“Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_24' data-id='LK9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will save it.</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_25' data-id='LK9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit their very self?</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_26' data-id='LK9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_27' data-id='LK9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Transfiguration </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_28' data-id='LK9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>About eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. </span>
<span class='v LK9_29' data-id='LK9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning. </span>
<span class='v LK9_30' data-id='LK9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK9_31' data-id='LK9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>They spoke about his departure,<span class='note' id='footnote-2652'><a href='#note-2652' class='key'>*</a></span> which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_32' data-id='LK9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_33' data-id='LK9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.” (He did not know what he was saying.) </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_34' data-id='LK9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and covered them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. </span>
<span class='v LK9_35' data-id='LK9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen; listen to him.” </span>
<span class='v LK9_36' data-id='LK9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When the voice had spoken, they found that Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_37' data-id='LK9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_38' data-id='LK9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, for he is my only child. </span>
<span class='v LK9_39' data-id='LK9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_40' data-id='LK9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_41' data-id='LK9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You unbelieving and perverse generation,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_42' data-id='LK9_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father. </span>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'>Jesus Predicts His Death a Second Time </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_43' data-id='LK9_43'>While everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v LK9_44' data-id='LK9_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Listen carefully to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK9_45' data-id='LK9_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so that they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_46' data-id='LK9_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>An argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest. </span>
<span class='v LK9_47' data-id='LK9_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Jesus, knowing their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him. </span>
<span class='v LK9_48' data-id='LK9_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_49' data-id='LK9_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_50' data-id='LK9_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Do not stop him,”</span> Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“for whoever is not against you is for you.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Samaritan Opposition </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_51' data-id='LK9_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>As the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_52' data-id='LK9_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him; </span>
<span class='v LK9_53' data-id='LK9_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>but the people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK9_54' data-id='LK9_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them<span class='note' id='footnote-2653'><a href='#note-2653' class='key'>†</a></span>?” </span>
<span class='v LK9_55' data-id='LK9_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>But Jesus turned and rebuked them. </span>
<span class='v LK9_56' data-id='LK9_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Then he and his disciples went to another village. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_58' data-id='LK9_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK9_59' data-id='LK9_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>He said to another man, <span class='wj'>“Follow me.”</span></span></div>
