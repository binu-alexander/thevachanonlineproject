<span class='v EX12_2' data-id='EX12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. </span>
<span class='v EX12_3' data-id='EX12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb<span class='note' id='footnote-245'><a href='#note-245' class='key'>*</a></span> for his family, one for each household. </span>
<span class='v EX12_4' data-id='EX12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If any household is too small for a whole lamb, they must share one with their nearest neighbor, having taken into account the number of people there are. You are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat. </span>
<span class='v EX12_5' data-id='EX12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The animals you choose must be year-old males without defect, and you may take them from the sheep or the goats. </span>
<span class='v EX12_6' data-id='EX12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month, when all the members of the community of Israel must slaughter them at twilight. </span>
<span class='v EX12_7' data-id='EX12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. </span>
<span class='v EX12_8' data-id='EX12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>That same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire, along with bitter herbs, and bread made without yeast. </span>
<span class='v EX12_9' data-id='EX12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not eat the meat raw or boiled in water, but roast it over a fire—with the head, legs and internal organs. </span>
<span class='v EX12_10' data-id='EX12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do not leave any of it till morning; if some is left till morning, you must burn it. </span>
<span class='v EX12_11' data-id='EX12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This is how you are to eat it: with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. Eat it in haste; it is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s Passover. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_12' data-id='EX12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“On that same night I will pass through Egypt and strike down every firstborn of both people and animals, and I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v EX12_13' data-id='EX12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are, and when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No destructive plague will touch you when I strike Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_14' data-id='EX12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“This is a day you are to commemorate; for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>—a lasting ordinance. </span>
<span class='v EX12_15' data-id='EX12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast. On the first day remove the yeast from your houses, for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX12_16' data-id='EX12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>On the first day hold a sacred assembly, and another one on the seventh day. Do no work at all on these days, except to prepare food for everyone to eat; that is all you may do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_17' data-id='EX12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. </span>
<span class='v EX12_18' data-id='EX12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. </span>
<span class='v EX12_19' data-id='EX12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses. And anyone, whether foreigner or native-born, who eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX12_20' data-id='EX12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Eat nothing made with yeast. Wherever you live, you must eat unleavened bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_21' data-id='EX12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. </span>
<span class='v EX12_22' data-id='EX12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Take a bunch of hyssop, dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe. None of you shall go out of the door of your house until morning. </span>
<span class='v EX12_23' data-id='EX12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> goes through the land to strike down the Egyptians, he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway, and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_24' data-id='EX12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants. </span>
<span class='v EX12_25' data-id='EX12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When you enter the land that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will give you as he promised, observe this ceremony. </span>
<span class='v EX12_26' data-id='EX12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And when your children ask you, ‘What does this ceremony mean to you?’ </span>
<span class='v EX12_27' data-id='EX12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>then tell them, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the Egyptians.’ ” Then the people bowed down and worshiped. </span>
<span class='v EX12_28' data-id='EX12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The Israelites did just what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses and Aaron. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_29' data-id='EX12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At midnight the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on the throne, to the firstborn of the prisoner, who was in the dungeon, and the firstborn of all the livestock as well. </span>
<span class='v EX12_30' data-id='EX12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh and all his officials and all the Egyptians got up during the night, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Exodus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_31' data-id='EX12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>During the night Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Up! Leave my people, you and the Israelites! Go, worship the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as you have requested. </span>
<span class='v EX12_32' data-id='EX12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Take your flocks and herds, as you have said, and go. And also bless me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_33' data-id='EX12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country. “For otherwise,” they said, “we will all die!” </span>
<span class='v EX12_34' data-id='EX12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So the people took their dough before the yeast was added, and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing. </span>
<span class='v EX12_35' data-id='EX12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The Israelites did as Moses instructed and asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing. </span>
<span class='v EX12_36' data-id='EX12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had made the Egyptians favorably disposed toward the people, and they gave them what they asked for; so they plundered the Egyptians. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_37' data-id='EX12_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and children. </span>
<span class='v EX12_38' data-id='EX12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Many other people went up with them, and also large droves of livestock, both flocks and herds. </span>
<span class='v EX12_39' data-id='EX12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>With the dough the Israelites had brought from Egypt, they baked loaves of unleavened bread. The dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of Egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_40' data-id='EX12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Now the length of time the Israelite people lived in Egypt<span class='note' id='footnote-246'><a href='#note-246' class='key'>†</a></span> was 430 years. </span>
<span class='v EX12_41' data-id='EX12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>At the end of the 430 years, to the very day, all the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s divisions left Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EX12_42' data-id='EX12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> kept vigil that night to bring them out of Egypt, on this night all the Israelites are to keep vigil to honor the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for the generations to come. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_43' data-id='EX12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “These are the regulations for the Passover meal: </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX12_46' data-id='EX12_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“It must be eaten inside the house; take none of the meat outside the house. Do not break any of the bones. </span>
<span class='v EX12_47' data-id='EX12_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The whole community of Israel must celebrate it. </span></div>

<span class='v EX12_49' data-id='EX12_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The same law applies both to the native-born and to the foreigner residing among you.” </span></div>

<span class='v EX12_50' data-id='EX12_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>All the Israelites did just what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded Moses and Aaron. </span>
