<div class='s'>Jehoiakim Burns Jeremiah’s Scroll </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_1' data-id='JR36_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v JR36_2' data-id='JR36_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Take a scroll and write on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah and all the other nations from the time I began speaking to you in the reign of Josiah till now. </span>
<span class='v JR36_3' data-id='JR36_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about every disaster I plan to inflict on them, they will each turn from their wicked ways; then I will forgive their wickedness and their sin.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_4' data-id='JR36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and while Jeremiah dictated all the words the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll. </span>
<span class='v JR36_5' data-id='JR36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah told Baruch, “I am restricted; I am not allowed to go to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple. </span>
<span class='v JR36_6' data-id='JR36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So you go to the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that you wrote as I dictated. Read them to all the people of Judah who come in from their towns. </span>
<span class='v JR36_7' data-id='JR36_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Perhaps they will bring their petition before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and will each turn from their wicked ways, for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> are great.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_8' data-id='JR36_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do; at the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple he read the words of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> from the scroll. </span>
<span class='v JR36_9' data-id='JR36_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, a time of fasting before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR36_10' data-id='JR36_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>From the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the New Gate of the temple, Baruch read to all the people at the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s temple the words of Jeremiah from the scroll. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_11' data-id='JR36_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> from the scroll, </span>
<span class='v JR36_12' data-id='JR36_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>he went down to the secretary’s room in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. </span>
<span class='v JR36_13' data-id='JR36_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>After Micaiah told them everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll, </span>
<span class='v JR36_14' data-id='JR36_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand. </span>
<span class='v JR36_15' data-id='JR36_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_15' data-id='JR36_15'>So Baruch read it to them. </span>
<span class='v JR36_16' data-id='JR36_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must report all these words to the king.” </span>
<span class='v JR36_17' data-id='JR36_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_18' data-id='JR36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in ink on the scroll.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_19' data-id='JR36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah, go and hide. Don’t let anyone know where you are.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_20' data-id='JR36_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>After they put the scroll in the room of Elishama the secretary, they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him. </span>
<span class='v JR36_21' data-id='JR36_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the room of Elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him. </span>
<span class='v JR36_22' data-id='JR36_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>It was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment, with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him. </span>
<span class='v JR36_23' data-id='JR36_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whenever Jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the firepot, until the entire scroll was burned in the fire. </span>
<span class='v JR36_24' data-id='JR36_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear, nor did they tear their clothes. </span>
<span class='v JR36_25' data-id='JR36_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. </span>
<span class='v JR36_26' data-id='JR36_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet. But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had hidden them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_27' data-id='JR36_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>After the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah: </span>
<span class='v JR36_28' data-id='JR36_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. </span>
<span class='v JR36_29' data-id='JR36_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Also tell Jehoiakim king of Judah, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and wipe from it both man and beast?” </span>
<span class='v JR36_30' data-id='JR36_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night. </span>
<span class='v JR36_31' data-id='JR36_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>I will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness; I will bring on them and those living in Jerusalem and the people of Judah every disaster I pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR36_32' data-id='JR36_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them. </span></div></div>
