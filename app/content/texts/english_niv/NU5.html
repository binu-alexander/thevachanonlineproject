<div class='s'>The Purity of the Camp </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU5_1' data-id='NU5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU5_2' data-id='NU5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a defiling skin disease<span class='note' id='footnote-428'><a href='#note-428' class='key'>*</a></span> or a discharge of any kind, or who is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body. </span>
<span class='v NU5_3' data-id='NU5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Send away male and female alike; send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp, where I dwell among them.” </span>
<span class='v NU5_4' data-id='NU5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp. They did just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had instructed Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Restitution for Wrongs </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU5_5' data-id='NU5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU5_6' data-id='NU5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Say to the Israelites: ‘Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way<span class='note' id='footnote-429'><a href='#note-429' class='key'>†</a></span> and so is unfaithful to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is guilty </span>
<span class='v NU5_7' data-id='NU5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and must confess the sin they have committed. They must make full restitution for the wrong they have done, add a fifth of the value to it and give it all to the person they have wronged. </span>
<span class='v NU5_8' data-id='NU5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong, the restitution belongs to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and must be given to the priest, along with the ram with which atonement is made for the wrongdoer. </span>
<span class='v NU5_9' data-id='NU5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>All the sacred contributions the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him. </span>
<span class='v NU5_10' data-id='NU5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Sacred things belong to their owners, but what they give to the priest will belong to the priest.’ ” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU5_11' data-id='NU5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, </span>

<span class='v NU5_13' data-id='NU5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>so that another man has sexual relations with her, and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected (since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act), </span>
<span class='v NU5_14' data-id='NU5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure— </span>
<span class='v NU5_15' data-id='NU5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>then he is to take his wife to the priest. He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah<span class='note' id='footnote-430'><a href='#note-430' class='key'>‡</a></span> of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing. </span></div>

<span class='v NU5_19' data-id='NU5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. </span>
<span class='v NU5_20' data-id='NU5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”— </span>

<span class='v NU5_24' data-id='NU5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. </span>
<span class='v NU5_25' data-id='NU5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and bring it to the altar. </span>
<span class='v NU5_26' data-id='NU5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial<span class='note' id='footnote-432'><a href='#note-432' class='key'>*</a></span> offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. </span>
<span class='v NU5_27' data-id='NU5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. </span>
<span class='v NU5_28' data-id='NU5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children. </span></div>
