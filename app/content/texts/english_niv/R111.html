<div class='s'>David Becomes King Over Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_1' data-id='R111_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>All Israel came together to David at Hebron and said, “We are your own flesh and blood. </span>
<span class='v R111_2' data-id='R111_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In the past, even while Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel on their military campaigns. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God said to you, ‘You will shepherd my people Israel, and you will become their ruler.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_3' data-id='R111_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When all the elders of Israel had come to King David at Hebron, he made a covenant with them at Hebron before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and they anointed David king over Israel, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had promised through Samuel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Conquers Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_4' data-id='R111_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>David and all the Israelites marched to Jerusalem (that is, Jebus). The Jebusites who lived there </span>
<span class='v R111_5' data-id='R111_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>said to David, “You will not get in here.” Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion—which is the City of David. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_6' data-id='R111_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>David had said, “Whoever leads the attack on the Jebusites will become commander-in-chief.” Joab son of Zeruiah went up first, and so he received the command. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_7' data-id='R111_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>David then took up residence in the fortress, and so it was called the City of David. </span>
<span class='v R111_8' data-id='R111_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He built up the city around it, from the terraces<span class='note' id='footnote-1067'><a href='#note-1067' class='key'>*</a></span> to the surrounding wall, while Joab restored the rest of the city. </span>
<span class='v R111_9' data-id='R111_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And David became more and more powerful, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty was with him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>David’s Mighty Warriors </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_10' data-id='R111_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>These were the chiefs of David’s mighty warriors—they, together with all Israel, gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had promised— </span>
<span class='v R111_11' data-id='R111_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>this is the list of David’s mighty warriors: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_11' data-id='R111_11'>Jashobeam,<span class='note' id='footnote-1068'><a href='#note-1068' class='key'>†</a></span> a Hakmonite, was chief of the officers<span class='note' id='footnote-1069'><a href='#note-1069' class='key'>‡</a></span>; he raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed in one encounter. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_12' data-id='R111_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Next to him was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite, one of the three mighty warriors. </span>
<span class='v R111_13' data-id='R111_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines gathered there for battle. At a place where there was a field full of barley, the troops fled from the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v R111_14' data-id='R111_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But they took their stand in the middle of the field. They defended it and struck the Philistines down, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> brought about a great victory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_15' data-id='R111_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Three of the thirty chiefs came down to David to the rock at the cave of Adullam, while a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v R111_16' data-id='R111_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At that time David was in the stronghold, and the Philistine garrison was at Bethlehem. </span>
<span class='v R111_17' data-id='R111_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>David longed for water and said, “Oh, that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem!” </span>
<span class='v R111_18' data-id='R111_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem and carried it back to David. But he refused to drink it; instead, he poured it out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R111_19' data-id='R111_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“God forbid that I should do this!” he said. “Should I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives?” Because they risked their lives to bring it back, David would not drink it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_19' data-id='R111_19'>Such were the exploits of the three mighty warriors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_20' data-id='R111_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the Three. He raised his spear against three hundred men, whom he killed, and so he became as famous as the Three. </span>
<span class='v R111_21' data-id='R111_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He was doubly honored above the Three and became their commander, even though he was not included among them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R111_22' data-id='R111_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant fighter from Kabzeel, performed great exploits. He struck down Moab’s two mightiest warriors. He also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. </span>
<span class='v R111_23' data-id='R111_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he struck down an Egyptian who was five cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-1070'><a href='#note-1070' class='key'>§</a></span> tall. Although the Egyptian had a spear like a weaver’s rod in his hand, Benaiah went against him with a club. He snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. </span>
<span class='v R111_24' data-id='R111_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada; he too was as famous as the three mighty warriors. </span>
<span class='v R111_25' data-id='R111_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He was held in greater honor than any of the Thirty, but he was not included among the Three. And David put him in charge of his bodyguard. </span></div>
