<span class='v DT28_58' data-id='DT28_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>If you do not carefully follow all the words of this law, which are written in this book, and do not revere this glorious and awesome name—the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God— </span>
<span class='v DT28_59' data-id='DT28_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants, harsh and prolonged disasters, and severe and lingering illnesses. </span>

<span class='v DT28_65' data-id='DT28_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Among those nations you will find no repose, no resting place for the sole of your foot. There the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will give you an anxious mind, eyes weary with longing, and a despairing heart. </span>
<span class='v DT28_66' data-id='DT28_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life. </span>
