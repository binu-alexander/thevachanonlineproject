<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_1' data-id='JN9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As he went along, he saw a man blind from birth. </span>
<span class='v JN9_2' data-id='JN9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_3' data-id='JN9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Neither this man nor his parents sinned,”</span> said Jesus, <span class='wj'>“but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.</span></span>
<span class='v JN9_4' data-id='JN9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me. Night is coming, when no one can work.</span></span>
<span class='v JN9_5' data-id='JN9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_6' data-id='JN9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man’s eyes. </span>
<span class='v JN9_7' data-id='JN9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Go,”</span> he told him, <span class='wj'>“wash in the Pool of Siloam”</span> (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and came home seeing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_8' data-id='JN9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>His neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?” </span>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Some claimed that he was. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'>Others said, “No, he only looks like him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_9' data-id='JN9_9'>But he himself insisted, “I am the man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_10' data-id='JN9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_11' data-id='JN9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He replied, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_12' data-id='JN9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Where is this man?” they asked him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_12' data-id='JN9_12'>“I don’t know,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Pharisees Investigate the Healing </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_13' data-id='JN9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. </span>
<span class='v JN9_14' data-id='JN9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now the day on which Jesus had made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v JN9_15' data-id='JN9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. “He put mud on my eyes,” the man replied, “and I washed, and now I see.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_16' data-id='JN9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_16' data-id='JN9_16'>But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So they were divided. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_17' data-id='JN9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then they turned again to the blind man, “What have you to say about him? It was your eyes he opened.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_17' data-id='JN9_17'>The man replied, “He is a prophet.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_18' data-id='JN9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the man’s parents. </span>
<span class='v JN9_19' data-id='JN9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Is this your son?” they asked. “Is this the one you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_20' data-id='JN9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“We know he is our son,” the parents answered, “and we know he was born blind. </span>
<span class='v JN9_21' data-id='JN9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we don’t know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.” </span>
<span class='v JN9_22' data-id='JN9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who already had decided that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue. </span>
<span class='v JN9_23' data-id='JN9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>That was why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_24' data-id='JN9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>A second time they summoned the man who had been blind. “Give glory to God by telling the truth,” they said. “We know this man is a sinner.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_25' data-id='JN9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He replied, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I don’t know. One thing I do know. I was blind but now I see!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_26' data-id='JN9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_27' data-id='JN9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples too?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_28' data-id='JN9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then they hurled insults at him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses! </span>
<span class='v JN9_29' data-id='JN9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we don’t even know where he comes from.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_30' data-id='JN9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes. </span>
<span class='v JN9_31' data-id='JN9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does his will. </span>
<span class='v JN9_32' data-id='JN9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind. </span>
<span class='v JN9_33' data-id='JN9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_34' data-id='JN9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_35' data-id='JN9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when he found him, he said, <span class='wj'>“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_36' data-id='JN9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“Who is he, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_37' data-id='JN9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“You have now seen him; in fact, he is the one speaking with you.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_38' data-id='JN9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_39' data-id='JN9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said,<span class='note' id='footnote-2738'><a href='#note-2738' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>“For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_40' data-id='JN9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN9_41' data-id='JN9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.</span></span></div></div>
