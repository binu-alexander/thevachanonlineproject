<span class='v DT34_1' data-id='DT34_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> showed him the whole land—from Gilead to Dan, </span>
<span class='v DT34_2' data-id='DT34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>all of Naphtali, the territory of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, </span>
<span class='v DT34_3' data-id='DT34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>the Negev and the whole region from the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. </span>
<span class='v DT34_4' data-id='DT34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob when I said, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not cross over into it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT34_5' data-id='DT34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> died there in Moab, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said. </span>
<span class='v DT34_6' data-id='DT34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He buried him<span class='note' id='footnote-552'><a href='#note-552' class='key'>*</a></span> in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is. </span>
<span class='v DT34_7' data-id='DT34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone. </span>
<span class='v DT34_8' data-id='DT34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The Israelites grieved for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the time of weeping and mourning was over. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT34_9' data-id='DT34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit<span class='note' id='footnote-553'><a href='#note-553' class='key'>†</a></span> of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT34_10' data-id='DT34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Since then, no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> knew face to face, </span>
<span class='v DT34_11' data-id='DT34_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>who did all those signs and wonders the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land. </span>
<span class='v DT34_12' data-id='DT34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that Moses did in the sight of all Israel. </span></div></div>
