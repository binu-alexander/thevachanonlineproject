<div class='s'>Isaac and Abimelek </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_1' data-id='GN26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a famine in the land—besides the previous famine in Abraham’s time—and Isaac went to Abimelek king of the Philistines in Gerar. </span>
<span class='v GN26_2' data-id='GN26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land where I tell you to live. </span>
<span class='v GN26_3' data-id='GN26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Stay in this land for a while, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and your descendants I will give all these lands and will confirm the oath I swore to your father Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GN26_4' data-id='GN26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your offspring<span class='note' id='footnote-111'><a href='#note-111' class='key'>*</a></span> all nations on earth will be blessed,<span class='note' id='footnote-112'><a href='#note-112' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v GN26_5' data-id='GN26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because Abraham obeyed me and did everything I required of him, keeping my commands, my decrees and my instructions.” </span>
<span class='v GN26_6' data-id='GN26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Isaac stayed in Gerar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_7' data-id='GN26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the men of that place asked him about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She is my wife.” He thought, “The men of this place might kill me on account of Rebekah, because she is beautiful.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_8' data-id='GN26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Isaac had been there a long time, Abimelek king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah. </span>
<span class='v GN26_9' data-id='GN26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Abimelek summoned Isaac and said, “She is really your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_9' data-id='GN26_9'>Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might lose my life on account of her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_10' data-id='GN26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelek said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the men might well have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_11' data-id='GN26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Abimelek gave orders to all the people: “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_12' data-id='GN26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> blessed him. </span>
<span class='v GN26_13' data-id='GN26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The man became rich, and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy. </span>
<span class='v GN26_14' data-id='GN26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He had so many flocks and herds and servants that the Philistines envied him. </span>
<span class='v GN26_15' data-id='GN26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the time of his father Abraham, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_16' data-id='GN26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelek said to Isaac, “Move away from us; you have become too powerful for us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_17' data-id='GN26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Isaac moved away from there and encamped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled. </span>
<span class='v GN26_18' data-id='GN26_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_19' data-id='GN26_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there. </span>
<span class='v GN26_20' data-id='GN26_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the herders of Gerar quarreled with those of Isaac and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek,<span class='note' id='footnote-113'><a href='#note-113' class='key'>‡</a></span> because they disputed with him. </span>
<span class='v GN26_21' data-id='GN26_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.<span class='note' id='footnote-114'><a href='#note-114' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v GN26_22' data-id='GN26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He moved on from there and dug another well, and no one quarreled over it. He named it Rehoboth,<span class='note' id='footnote-115'><a href='#note-115' class='key'>*</a></span> saying, “Now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given us room and we will flourish in the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_23' data-id='GN26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>From there he went up to Beersheba. </span>
<span class='v GN26_24' data-id='GN26_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>That night the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_25' data-id='GN26_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_26' data-id='GN26_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile, Abimelek had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his personal adviser and Phicol the commander of his forces. </span>
<span class='v GN26_27' data-id='GN26_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_28' data-id='GN26_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They answered, “We saw clearly that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was with you; so we said, ‘There ought to be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a treaty with you </span>
<span class='v GN26_29' data-id='GN26_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>that you will do us no harm, just as we did not harm you but always treated you well and sent you away peacefully. And now you are blessed by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_30' data-id='GN26_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Isaac then made a feast for them, and they ate and drank. </span>
<span class='v GN26_31' data-id='GN26_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they went away peacefully. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_32' data-id='GN26_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We’ve found water!” </span>
<span class='v GN26_33' data-id='GN26_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He called it Shibah,<span class='note' id='footnote-116'><a href='#note-116' class='key'>†</a></span> and to this day the name of the town has been Beersheba.<span class='note' id='footnote-117'><a href='#note-117' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN26_34' data-id='GN26_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath daughter of Elon the Hittite. </span>
<span class='v GN26_35' data-id='GN26_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah. </span></div></div>
