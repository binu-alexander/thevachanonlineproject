<div class='s'>David Enrolls the Fighting Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_1' data-id='S224_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> burned against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_2' data-id='S224_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So the king said to Joab and the army commanders<span class='note' id='footnote-829'><a href='#note-829' class='key'>*</a></span> with him, “Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and enroll the fighting men, so that I may know how many there are.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_3' data-id='S224_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Joab replied to the king, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God multiply the troops a hundred times over, and may the eyes of my lord the king see it. But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_4' data-id='S224_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king’s word, however, overruled Joab and the army commanders; so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_5' data-id='S224_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>After crossing the Jordan, they camped near Aroer, south of the town in the gorge, and then went through Gad and on to Jazer. </span>
<span class='v S224_6' data-id='S224_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They went to Gilead and the region of Tahtim Hodshi, and on to Dan Jaan and around toward Sidon. </span>
<span class='v S224_7' data-id='S224_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then they went toward the fortress of Tyre and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went on to Beersheba in the Negev of Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_8' data-id='S224_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>After they had gone through the entire land, they came back to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_9' data-id='S224_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king: In Israel there were eight hundred thousand able-bodied men who could handle a sword, and in Judah five hundred thousand. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_10' data-id='S224_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>David was conscience-stricken after he had counted the fighting men, and he said to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. Now, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I beg you, take away the guilt of your servant. I have done a very foolish thing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_11' data-id='S224_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Before David got up the next morning, the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had come to Gad the prophet, David’s seer: </span>
<span class='v S224_12' data-id='S224_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am giving you three options. Choose one of them for me to carry out against you.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_13' data-id='S224_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Gad went to David and said to him, “Shall there come on you three<span class='note' id='footnote-830'><a href='#note-830' class='key'>†</a></span> years of famine in your land? Or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you? Or three days of plague in your land? Now then, think it over and decide how I should answer the one who sent me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_14' data-id='S224_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>David said to Gad, “I am in deep distress. Let us fall into the hands of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for his mercy is great; but do not let me fall into human hands.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_15' data-id='S224_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent a plague on Israel from that morning until the end of the time designated, and seventy thousand of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. </span>
<span class='v S224_16' data-id='S224_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When the angel stretched out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> relented concerning the disaster and said to the angel who was afflicting the people, “Enough! Withdraw your hand.” The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was then at the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_17' data-id='S224_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he said to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “I have sinned; I, the shepherd,<span class='note' id='footnote-831'><a href='#note-831' class='key'>‡</a></span> have done wrong. These are but sheep. What have they done? Let your hand fall on me and my family.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Builds an Altar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_18' data-id='S224_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>On that day Gad went to David and said to him, “Go up and build an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.” </span>
<span class='v S224_19' data-id='S224_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So David went up, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded through Gad. </span>
<span class='v S224_20' data-id='S224_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When Araunah looked and saw the king and his officials coming toward him, he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_21' data-id='S224_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_21' data-id='S224_21'>“To buy your threshing floor,” David answered, “so I can build an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, that the plague on the people may be stopped.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_22' data-id='S224_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take whatever he wishes and offer it up. Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood. </span>
<span class='v S224_23' data-id='S224_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Your Majesty, Araunah<span class='note' id='footnote-832'><a href='#note-832' class='key'>§</a></span> gives all this to the king.” Araunah also said to him, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God accept you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_24' data-id='S224_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S224_24' data-id='S224_24'>So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-833'><a href='#note-833' class='key'>*</a></span> of silver for them. </span>
<span class='v S224_25' data-id='S224_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>David built an altar to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped. </span></div></div>
