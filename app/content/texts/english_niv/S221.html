<div class='s'>The Gibeonites Avenged </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_1' data-id='S221_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>During the reign of David, there was a famine for three successive years; so David sought the face of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “It is on account of Saul and his blood-stained house; it is because he put the Gibeonites to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_2' data-id='S221_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The king summoned the Gibeonites and spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites were not a part of Israel but were survivors of the Amorites; the Israelites had sworn to spare them, but Saul in his zeal for Israel and Judah had tried to annihilate them.) </span>
<span class='v S221_3' data-id='S221_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>David asked the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you? How shall I make atonement so that you will bless the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s inheritance?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_4' data-id='S221_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Gibeonites answered him, “We have no right to demand silver or gold from Saul or his family, nor do we have the right to put anyone in Israel to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_4' data-id='S221_4'>“What do you want me to do for you?” David asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_5' data-id='S221_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They answered the king, “As for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in Israel, </span>
<span class='v S221_6' data-id='S221_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and their bodies exposed before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> at Gibeah of Saul—the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s chosen one.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_6' data-id='S221_6'>So the king said, “I will give them to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_7' data-id='S221_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The king spared Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> between David and Jonathan son of Saul. </span>
<span class='v S221_8' data-id='S221_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons of Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, whom she had borne to Saul, together with the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab,<span class='note' id='footnote-804'><a href='#note-804' class='key'>*</a></span> whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite. </span>
<span class='v S221_9' data-id='S221_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He handed them over to the Gibeonites, who killed them and exposed their bodies on a hill before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. All seven of them fell together; they were put to death during the first days of the harvest, just as the barley harvest was beginning. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_10' data-id='S221_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Rizpah daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock. From the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies, she did not let the birds touch them by day or the wild animals by night. </span>
<span class='v S221_11' data-id='S221_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When David was told what Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, Saul’s concubine, had done, </span>
<span class='v S221_12' data-id='S221_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>he went and took the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh Gilead. (They had stolen their bodies from the public square at Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hung them after they struck Saul down on Gilboa.) </span>
<span class='v S221_13' data-id='S221_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there, and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_14' data-id='S221_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish, at Zela in Benjamin, and did everything the king commanded. After that, God answered prayer in behalf of the land. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Wars Against the Philistines </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_15' data-id='S221_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Once again there was a battle between the Philistines and Israel. David went down with his men to fight against the Philistines, and he became exhausted. </span>
<span class='v S221_16' data-id='S221_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Ishbi-Benob, one of the descendants of Rapha, whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-805'><a href='#note-805' class='key'>†</a></span> and who was armed with a new sword, said he would kill David. </span>
<span class='v S221_17' data-id='S221_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David’s rescue; he struck the Philistine down and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him, saying, “Never again will you go out with us to battle, so that the lamp of Israel will not be extinguished.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_18' data-id='S221_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In the course of time, there was another battle with the Philistines, at Gob. At that time Sibbekai the Hushathite killed Saph, one of the descendants of Rapha. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_19' data-id='S221_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In another battle with the Philistines at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair<span class='note' id='footnote-806'><a href='#note-806' class='key'>‡</a></span> the Bethlehemite killed the brother of<span class='note' id='footnote-807'><a href='#note-807' class='key'>§</a></span> Goliath the Gittite, who had a spear with a shaft like a weaver’s rod. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_20' data-id='S221_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In still another battle, which took place at Gath, there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four in all. He also was descended from Rapha. </span>
<span class='v S221_21' data-id='S221_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David’s brother, killed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S221_22' data-id='S221_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>These four were descendants of Rapha in Gath, and they fell at the hands of David and his men. </span></div></div>
