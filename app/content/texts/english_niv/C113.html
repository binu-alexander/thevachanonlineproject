<span class='v C113_2' data-id='C113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. </span>
<span class='v C113_3' data-id='C113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,<span class='note' id='footnote-2995'><a href='#note-2995' class='key'>†</a></span> but do not have love, I gain nothing. </span></div>

<span class='v C113_4' data-id='C113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. </span>
<span class='v C113_5' data-id='C113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. </span>
<span class='v C113_6' data-id='C113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. </span>
<span class='v C113_7' data-id='C113_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. </span></div>

<span class='v C113_8' data-id='C113_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. </span>
<span class='v C113_9' data-id='C113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, </span>
<span class='v C113_10' data-id='C113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. </span>
<span class='v C113_11' data-id='C113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. </span>
<span class='v C113_12' data-id='C113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. </span></div>
