<div class='s'>The River From the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK47_1' data-id='EK47_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. </span>
<span class='v EK47_2' data-id='EK47_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was trickling from the south side. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK47_3' data-id='EK47_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured off a thousand cubits<span class='note' id='footnote-2207'><a href='#note-2207' class='key'>*</a></span> and then led me through water that was ankle-deep. </span>
<span class='v EK47_4' data-id='EK47_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee-deep. He measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist. </span>
<span class='v EK47_5' data-id='EK47_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He measured off another thousand, but now it was a river that I could not cross, because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that no one could cross. </span>
<span class='v EK47_6' data-id='EK47_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He asked me, “Son of man, do you see this?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK47_6' data-id='EK47_6'>Then he led me back to the bank of the river. </span>
<span class='v EK47_7' data-id='EK47_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When I arrived there, I saw a great number of trees on each side of the river. </span>
<span class='v EK47_8' data-id='EK47_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah,<span class='note' id='footnote-2208'><a href='#note-2208' class='key'>†</a></span> where it enters the Dead Sea. When it empties into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh. </span>
<span class='v EK47_9' data-id='EK47_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows. There will be large numbers of fish, because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh; so where the river flows everything will live. </span>
<span class='v EK47_10' data-id='EK47_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds—like the fish of the Mediterranean Sea. </span>
<span class='v EK47_11' data-id='EK47_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. </span>
<span class='v EK47_12' data-id='EK47_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. Every month they will bear fruit, because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Boundaries of the Land </div>

<span class='v EK47_13' data-id='EK47_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: “These are the boundaries of the land that you will divide among the twelve tribes of Israel as their inheritance, with two portions for Joseph. </span>
<span class='v EK47_14' data-id='EK47_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You are to divide it equally among them. Because I swore with uplifted hand to give it to your ancestors, this land will become your inheritance. </span></div>

<span class='v EK47_17' data-id='EK47_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan,<span class='note' id='footnote-2210'><a href='#note-2210' class='key'>§</a></span> along the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north.

<span class='v EK47_23' data-id='EK47_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>In whatever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to give them their inheritance,” declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div></div>
