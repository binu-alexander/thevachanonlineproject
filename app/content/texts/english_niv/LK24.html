<div class='s'>Jesus Has Risen </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_1' data-id='LK24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb. </span>
<span class='v LK24_2' data-id='LK24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They found the stone rolled away from the tomb, </span>
<span class='v LK24_3' data-id='LK24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK24_4' data-id='LK24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>While they were wondering about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_5' data-id='LK24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? </span>
<span class='v LK24_6' data-id='LK24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: </span>
<span class='v LK24_7' data-id='LK24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>‘The Son of Man must be delivered over to the hands of sinners, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.’ </span> ” </span>
<span class='v LK24_8' data-id='LK24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then they remembered his words. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_9' data-id='LK24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they came back from the tomb, they told all these things to the Eleven and to all the others. </span>
<span class='v LK24_10' data-id='LK24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the others with them who told this to the apostles. </span>
<span class='v LK24_11' data-id='LK24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But they did not believe the women, because their words seemed to them like nonsense. </span>
<span class='v LK24_12' data-id='LK24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. Bending over, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves, and he went away, wondering to himself what had happened. </span></div>
<div class='s'>On the Road to Emmaus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_13' data-id='LK24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles<span class='note' id='footnote-2697'><a href='#note-2697' class='key'>*</a></span> from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v LK24_14' data-id='LK24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They were talking with each other about everything that had happened. </span>
<span class='v LK24_15' data-id='LK24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As they talked and discussed these things with each other, Jesus himself came up and walked along with them; </span>
<span class='v LK24_16' data-id='LK24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>but they were kept from recognizing him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_17' data-id='LK24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He asked them, <span class='wj'>“What are you discussing together as you walk along?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_17' data-id='LK24_17'>They stood still, their faces downcast. </span>
<span class='v LK24_18' data-id='LK24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>One of them, named Cleopas, asked him, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_19' data-id='LK24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What things?”</span> he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_19' data-id='LK24_19'>“About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet, powerful in word and deed before God and all the people. </span>
<span class='v LK24_20' data-id='LK24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him; </span>
<span class='v LK24_21' data-id='LK24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And what is more, it is the third day since all this took place. </span>
<span class='v LK24_22' data-id='LK24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In addition, some of our women amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning </span>
<span class='v LK24_23' data-id='LK24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>but didn’t find his body. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. </span>
<span class='v LK24_24' data-id='LK24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see Jesus.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_25' data-id='LK24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“How foolish you are, and how slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_26' data-id='LK24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Did not the Messiah have to suffer these things and then enter his glory?”</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_27' data-id='LK24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_28' data-id='LK24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus continued on as if he were going farther. </span>
<span class='v LK24_29' data-id='LK24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_30' data-id='LK24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_31' data-id='LK24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. </span>
<span class='v LK24_32' data-id='LK24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_33' data-id='LK24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They got up and returned at once to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, assembled together </span>
<span class='v LK24_34' data-id='LK24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>and saying, “It is true! The Lord has risen and has appeared to Simon.” </span>
<span class='v LK24_35' data-id='LK24_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then the two told what had happened on the way, and how Jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to the Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_36' data-id='LK24_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Peace be with you.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_37' data-id='LK24_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. </span>
<span class='v LK24_38' data-id='LK24_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds?</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_39' data-id='LK24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_40' data-id='LK24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. </span>
<span class='v LK24_41' data-id='LK24_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, <span class='wj'>“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_42' data-id='LK24_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish, </span>
<span class='v LK24_43' data-id='LK24_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and he took it and ate it in their presence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_44' data-id='LK24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>He said to them, <span class='wj'>“This is what I told you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_45' data-id='LK24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. </span>
<span class='v LK24_46' data-id='LK24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>He told them, <span class='wj'>“This is what is written: The Messiah will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, </span></span>
<span class='v LK24_47' data-id='LK24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_48' data-id='LK24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You are witnesses of these things.</span></span>
<span class='v LK24_49' data-id='LK24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I am going to send you what my Father has promised; but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK24_50' data-id='LK24_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>When he had led them out to the vicinity of Bethany, he lifted up his hands and blessed them. </span>
<span class='v LK24_51' data-id='LK24_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up into heaven. </span>
<span class='v LK24_52' data-id='LK24_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. </span>
<span class='v LK24_53' data-id='LK24_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. </span></div></div>
