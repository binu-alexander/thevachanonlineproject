<div class='s'>Ahab’s Family Killed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_1' data-id='K210_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there were in Samaria seventy sons of the house of Ahab. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria: to the officials of Jezreel,<span class='note' id='footnote-949'><a href='#note-949' class='key'>*</a></span> to the elders and to the guardians of Ahab’s children. He said, </span>
<span class='v K210_2' data-id='K210_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“You have your master’s sons with you and you have chariots and horses, a fortified city and weapons. Now as soon as this letter reaches you, </span>
<span class='v K210_3' data-id='K210_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>choose the best and most worthy of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne. Then fight for your master’s house.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_4' data-id='K210_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But they were terrified and said, “If two kings could not resist him, how can we?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_5' data-id='K210_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the palace administrator, the city governor, the elders and the guardians sent this message to Jehu: “We are your servants and we will do anything you say. We will not appoint anyone as king; you do whatever you think best.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_6' data-id='K210_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, take the heads of your master’s sons and come to me in Jezreel by this time tomorrow.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_6' data-id='K210_6'>Now the royal princes, seventy of them, were with the leading men of the city, who were rearing them. </span>
<span class='v K210_7' data-id='K210_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the letter arrived, these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu in Jezreel. </span>
<span class='v K210_8' data-id='K210_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the messenger arrived, he told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the princes.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_8' data-id='K210_8'>Then Jehu ordered, “Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_9' data-id='K210_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The next morning Jehu went out. He stood before all the people and said, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him, but who killed all these? </span>
<span class='v K210_10' data-id='K210_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Know, then, that not a word the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has spoken against the house of Ahab will fail. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has done what he announced through his servant Elijah.” </span>
<span class='v K210_11' data-id='K210_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Jehu killed everyone in Jezreel who remained of the house of Ahab, as well as all his chief men, his close friends and his priests, leaving him no survivor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_12' data-id='K210_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jehu then set out and went toward Samaria. At Beth Eked of the Shepherds, </span>
<span class='v K210_13' data-id='K210_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>he met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and asked, “Who are you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_13' data-id='K210_13'>They said, “We are relatives of Ahaziah, and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_14' data-id='K210_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Take them alive!” he ordered. So they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of Beth Eked—forty-two of them. He left no survivor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_15' data-id='K210_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>After he left there, he came upon Jehonadab son of Rekab, who was on his way to meet him. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you in accord with me, as I am with you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_15' data-id='K210_15'>“I am,” Jehonadab answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_15' data-id='K210_15'>“If so,” said Jehu, “give me your hand.” So he did, and Jehu helped him up into the chariot. </span>
<span class='v K210_16' data-id='K210_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jehu said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” Then he had him ride along in his chariot. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_17' data-id='K210_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all who were left there of Ahab’s family; he destroyed them, according to the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoken to Elijah. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Servants of Baal Killed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_18' data-id='K210_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much. </span>
<span class='v K210_19' data-id='K210_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now summon all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and all his priests. See that no one is missing, because I am going to hold a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who fails to come will no longer live.” But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_20' data-id='K210_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jehu said, “Call an assembly in honor of Baal.” So they proclaimed it. </span>
<span class='v K210_21' data-id='K210_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then he sent word throughout Israel, and all the servants of Baal came; not one stayed away. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from one end to the other. </span>
<span class='v K210_22' data-id='K210_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring robes for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out robes for them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_23' data-id='K210_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rekab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look around and see that no one who serves the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is here with you—only servants of Baal.” </span>
<span class='v K210_24' data-id='K210_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning: “If one of you lets any of the men I am placing in your hands escape, it will be your life for his life.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_25' data-id='K210_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As soon as Jehu had finished making the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and officers: “Go in and kill them; let no one escape.” So they cut them down with the sword. The guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of Baal. </span>
<span class='v K210_26' data-id='K210_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They brought the sacred stone out of the temple of Baal and burned it. </span>
<span class='v K210_27' data-id='K210_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They demolished the sacred stone of Baal and tore down the temple of Baal, and people have used it for a latrine to this day. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_28' data-id='K210_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel. </span>
<span class='v K210_29' data-id='K210_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>However, he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit—the worship of the golden calves at Bethel and Dan. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_30' data-id='K210_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Jehu, “Because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of Ahab all I had in mind to do, your descendants will sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation.” </span>
<span class='v K210_31' data-id='K210_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Yet Jehu was not careful to keep the law of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_32' data-id='K210_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>In those days the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> began to reduce the size of Israel. Hazael overpowered the Israelites throughout their territory </span>
<span class='v K210_33' data-id='K210_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>east of the Jordan in all the land of Gilead (the region of Gad, Reuben and Manasseh), from Aroer by the Arnon Gorge through Gilead to Bashan. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_34' data-id='K210_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of Jehu’s reign, all he did, and all his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K210_35' data-id='K210_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jehu rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king. </span>
<span class='v K210_36' data-id='K210_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years. </span></div></div>
