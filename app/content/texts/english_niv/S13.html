<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Calls Samuel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_1' data-id='S13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The boy Samuel ministered before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> under Eli. In those days the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was rare; there were not many visions. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_2' data-id='S13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying down in his usual place. </span>
<span class='v S13_3' data-id='S13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, where the ark of God was. </span>
<span class='v S13_4' data-id='S13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> called Samuel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_4' data-id='S13_4'>Samuel answered, “Here I am.” </span>
<span class='v S13_5' data-id='S13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_5' data-id='S13_5'>But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_6' data-id='S13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Again the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_6' data-id='S13_6'>“My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_7' data-id='S13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had not yet been revealed to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_8' data-id='S13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>A third time the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_8' data-id='S13_8'>Then Eli realized that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was calling the boy. </span>
<span class='v S13_9' data-id='S13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say, ‘Speak, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for your servant is listening.’ ” So Samuel went and lay down in his place. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_10' data-id='S13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_10' data-id='S13_10'>Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_11' data-id='S13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Samuel: “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears about it tingle. </span>
<span class='v S13_12' data-id='S13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>At that time I will carry out against Eli everything I spoke against his family—from beginning to end. </span>
<span class='v S13_13' data-id='S13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about; his sons blasphemed God,<span class='note' id='footnote-685'><a href='#note-685' class='key'>*</a></span> and he failed to restrain them. </span>
<span class='v S13_14' data-id='S13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_15' data-id='S13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. He was afraid to tell Eli the vision, </span>
<span class='v S13_16' data-id='S13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_16' data-id='S13_16'>Samuel answered, “Here I am.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_17' data-id='S13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“What was it he said to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you hide from me anything he told you.” </span>
<span class='v S13_18' data-id='S13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Then Eli said, “He is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; let him do what is good in his eyes.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S13_19' data-id='S13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was with Samuel as he grew up, and he let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground. </span>
<span class='v S13_20' data-id='S13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognized that Samuel was attested as a prophet of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v S13_21' data-id='S13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> continued to appear at Shiloh, and there he revealed himself to Samuel through his word. </span></div></div>
