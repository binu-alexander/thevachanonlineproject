<div class='s'>Moses and the Burning Bush </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_1' data-id='EX3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. </span>
<span class='v EX3_2' data-id='EX3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. </span>
<span class='v EX3_3' data-id='EX3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_4' data-id='EX3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_4' data-id='EX3_4'>And Moses said, “Here I am.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_5' data-id='EX3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.” </span>
<span class='v EX3_6' data-id='EX3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “I am the God of your father,<span class='note' id='footnote-229'><a href='#note-229' class='key'>*</a></span> the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_7' data-id='EX3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. </span>
<span class='v EX3_8' data-id='EX3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. </span>
<span class='v EX3_9' data-id='EX3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. </span>
<span class='v EX3_10' data-id='EX3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_11' data-id='EX3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_12' data-id='EX3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you<span class='note' id='footnote-230'><a href='#note-230' class='key'>†</a></span> will worship God on this mountain.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_13' data-id='EX3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_14' data-id='EX3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>God said to Moses, “<span class='nd'>I am who I am</span>.<span class='note' id='footnote-231'><a href='#note-231' class='key'>‡</a></span> This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘<span class='nd'>I am</span> has sent me to you.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_15' data-id='EX3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>,<span class='note' id='footnote-232'><a href='#note-232' class='key'>§</a></span> the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EX3_15' data-id='EX3_15'>“This is my name forever, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EX3_15' data-id='EX3_15'>the name you shall call me </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EX3_15' data-id='EX3_15'>from generation to generation. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_16' data-id='EX3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt. </span>
<span class='v EX3_17' data-id='EX3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_18' data-id='EX3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God.’ </span>
<span class='v EX3_19' data-id='EX3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him. </span>
<span class='v EX3_20' data-id='EX3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX3_21' data-id='EX3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed. </span>
<span class='v EX3_22' data-id='EX3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. And so you will plunder the Egyptians.” </span></div></div>
