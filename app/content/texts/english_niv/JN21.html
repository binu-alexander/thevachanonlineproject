<div class='s'>Jesus and the Miraculous Catch of Fish </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_1' data-id='JN21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus appeared again to his disciples, by the Sea of Galilee.<span class='note' id='footnote-2776'><a href='#note-2776' class='key'>*</a></span> It happened this way: </span>
<span class='v JN21_2' data-id='JN21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter, Thomas (also known as Didymus<span class='note' id='footnote-2777'><a href='#note-2777' class='key'>†</a></span>), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together. </span>
<span class='v JN21_3' data-id='JN21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“I’m going out to fish,” Simon Peter told them, and they said, “We’ll go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_4' data-id='JN21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_5' data-id='JN21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He called out to them, <span class='wj'>“Friends, haven’t you any fish?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_5' data-id='JN21_5'>“No,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_6' data-id='JN21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“Throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.”</span> When they did, they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_7' data-id='JN21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” As soon as Simon Peter heard him say, “It is the Lord,” he wrapped his outer garment around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. </span>
<span class='v JN21_8' data-id='JN21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from shore, about a hundred yards.<span class='note' id='footnote-2778'><a href='#note-2778' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN21_9' data-id='JN21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it, and some bread. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_10' data-id='JN21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Bring some of the fish you have just caught.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN21_11' data-id='JN21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Simon Peter climbed back into the boat and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even with so many the net was not torn. </span>
<span class='v JN21_12' data-id='JN21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Come and have breakfast.”</span> None of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JN21_13' data-id='JN21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. </span>
<span class='v JN21_14' data-id='JN21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Reinstates Peter </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class='wj'>“Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'>“Yes, Lord,” he said, “you know that I love you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_15' data-id='JN21_15'>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Feed my lambs.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Again Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'>He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_16' data-id='JN21_16'>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Take care of my sheep.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_17' data-id='JN21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The third time he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Simon son of John, do you love me?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_17' data-id='JN21_17'>Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, <span class='wj'>“Do you love me?”</span> He said, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_17' data-id='JN21_17'>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Feed my sheep.</span></span>
<span class='v JN21_18' data-id='JN21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Very truly I tell you, when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted; but when you are old you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN21_19' data-id='JN21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. Then he said to him, <span class='wj'>“Follow me!”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_20' data-id='JN21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”) </span>
<span class='v JN21_21' data-id='JN21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_22' data-id='JN21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN21_23' data-id='JN21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, <span class='wj'>“If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_24' data-id='JN21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN21_25' data-id='JN21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written. </span></div></div>
