<div class='s'>David’s Charge to Solomon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_1' data-id='K12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the time drew near for David to die, he gave a charge to Solomon his son. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_2' data-id='K12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“I am about to go the way of all the earth,” he said. “So be strong, act like a man, </span>
<span class='v K12_3' data-id='K12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and observe what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God requires: Walk in obedience to him, and keep his decrees and commands, his laws and regulations, as written in the Law of Moses. Do this so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go </span>
<span class='v K12_4' data-id='K12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> may keep his promise to me: ‘If your descendants watch how they live, and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul, you will never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_5' data-id='K12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Now you yourself know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me—what he did to the two commanders of Israel’s armies, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He killed them, shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle, and with that blood he stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet. </span>
<span class='v K12_6' data-id='K12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Deal with him according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_7' data-id='K12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table. They stood by me when I fled from your brother Absalom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_8' data-id='K12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“And remember, you have with you Shimei son of Gera, the Benjamite from Bahurim, who called down bitter curses on me the day I went to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: ‘I will not put you to death by the sword.’ </span>
<span class='v K12_9' data-id='K12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But now, do not consider him innocent. You are a man of wisdom; you will know what to do to him. Bring his gray head down to the grave in blood.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_10' data-id='K12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then David rested with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. </span>
<span class='v K12_11' data-id='K12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He had reigned forty years over Israel—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K12_12' data-id='K12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his rule was firmly established. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon’s Throne Established </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_13' data-id='K12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now Adonijah, the son of Haggith, went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. Bathsheba asked him, “Do you come peacefully?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_13' data-id='K12_13'>He answered, “Yes, peacefully.” </span>
<span class='v K12_14' data-id='K12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he added, “I have something to say to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_14' data-id='K12_14'>“You may say it,” she replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_15' data-id='K12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“As you know,” he said, “the kingdom was mine. All Israel looked to me as their king. But things changed, and the kingdom has gone to my brother; for it has come to him from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v K12_16' data-id='K12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now I have one request to make of you. Do not refuse me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_16' data-id='K12_16'>“You may make it,” she said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_17' data-id='K12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So he continued, “Please ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_18' data-id='K12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“Very well,” Bathsheba replied, “I will speak to the king for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_19' data-id='K12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah, the king stood up to meet her, bowed down to her and sat down on his throne. He had a throne brought for the king’s mother, and she sat down at his right hand. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_20' data-id='K12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“I have one small request to make of you,” she said. “Do not refuse me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_20' data-id='K12_20'>The king replied, “Make it, my mother; I will not refuse you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_21' data-id='K12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given in marriage to your brother Adonijah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_22' data-id='K12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you request Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? You might as well request the kingdom for him—after all, he is my older brother—yes, for him and for Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_23' data-id='K12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then King Solomon swore by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: “May God deal with me, be it ever so severely, if Adonijah does not pay with his life for this request! </span>
<span class='v K12_24' data-id='K12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And now, as surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives—he who has established me securely on the throne of my father David and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised—Adonijah shall be put to death today!” </span>
<span class='v K12_25' data-id='K12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he struck down Adonijah and he died. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_26' data-id='K12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go back to your fields in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not put you to death now, because you carried the ark of the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> before my father David and shared all my father’s hardships.” </span>
<span class='v K12_27' data-id='K12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, fulfilling the word the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had spoken at Shiloh about the house of Eli. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_28' data-id='K12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When the news reached Joab, who had conspired with Adonijah though not with Absalom, he fled to the tent of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and took hold of the horns of the altar. </span>
<span class='v K12_29' data-id='K12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>King Solomon was told that Joab had fled to the tent of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and was beside the altar. Then Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada, “Go, strike him down!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_30' data-id='K12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So Benaiah entered the tent of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said to Joab, “The king says, ‘Come out!’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_30' data-id='K12_30'>But he answered, “No, I will die here.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_30' data-id='K12_30'>Benaiah reported to the king, “This is how Joab answered me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_31' data-id='K12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then the king commanded Benaiah, “Do as he says. Strike him down and bury him, and so clear me and my whole family of the guilt of the innocent blood that Joab shed. </span>
<span class='v K12_32' data-id='K12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will repay him for the blood he shed, because without my father David knowing it he attacked two men and killed them with the sword. Both of them—Abner son of Ner, commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, commander of Judah’s army—were better men and more upright than he. </span>
<span class='v K12_33' data-id='K12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>May the guilt of their blood rest on the head of Joab and his descendants forever. But on David and his descendants, his house and his throne, may there be the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s peace forever.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_34' data-id='K12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up and struck down Joab and killed him, and he was buried at his home out in the country. </span>
<span class='v K12_35' data-id='K12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The king put Benaiah son of Jehoiada over the army in Joab’s position and replaced Abiathar with Zadok the priest. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_36' data-id='K12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then the king sent for Shimei and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but do not go anywhere else. </span>
<span class='v K12_37' data-id='K12_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>The day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, you can be sure you will die; your blood will be on your own head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_38' data-id='K12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Shimei answered the king, “What you say is good. Your servant will do as my lord the king has said.” And Shimei stayed in Jerusalem for a long time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_39' data-id='K12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>But three years later, two of Shimei’s slaves ran off to Achish son of Maakah, king of Gath, and Shimei was told, “Your slaves are in Gath.” </span>
<span class='v K12_40' data-id='K12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>At this, he saddled his donkey and went to Achish at Gath in search of his slaves. So Shimei went away and brought the slaves back from Gath. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_41' data-id='K12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>When Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned, </span>
<span class='v K12_42' data-id='K12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Did I not make you swear by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and warn you, ‘On the day you leave to go anywhere else, you can be sure you will die’? At that time you said to me, ‘What you say is good. I will obey.’ </span>
<span class='v K12_43' data-id='K12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Why then did you not keep your oath to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and obey the command I gave you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_44' data-id='K12_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>The king also said to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father David. Now the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will repay you for your wrongdoing. </span>
<span class='v K12_45' data-id='K12_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain secure before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> forever.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_46' data-id='K12_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Then the king gave the order to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down and he died. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K12_46' data-id='K12_46'>The kingdom was now established in Solomon’s hands. </span></div></div>
