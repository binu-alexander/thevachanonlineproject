<div class='s'>Bricks Without Straw </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_1' data-id='EX5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let my people go, so that they may hold a festival to me in the wilderness.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_2' data-id='EX5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, “Who is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, that I should obey him and let Israel go? I do not know the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and I will not let Israel go.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_3' data-id='EX5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God, or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_4' data-id='EX5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labor? Get back to your work!” </span>
<span class='v EX5_5' data-id='EX5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_6' data-id='EX5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people: </span>
<span class='v EX5_7' data-id='EX5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“You are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks; let them go and gather their own straw. </span>
<span class='v EX5_8' data-id='EX5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ </span>
<span class='v EX5_9' data-id='EX5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Make the work harder for the people so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_10' data-id='EX5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the slave drivers and the overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you any more straw. </span>
<span class='v EX5_11' data-id='EX5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced at all.’ ” </span>
<span class='v EX5_12' data-id='EX5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. </span>
<span class='v EX5_13' data-id='EX5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.” </span>
<span class='v EX5_14' data-id='EX5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite overseers they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_15' data-id='EX5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the Israelite overseers went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way? </span>
<span class='v EX5_16' data-id='EX5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_17' data-id='EX5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, “Lazy, that’s what you are—lazy! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ </span>
<span class='v EX5_18' data-id='EX5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_19' data-id='EX5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Israelite overseers realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day.” </span>
<span class='v EX5_20' data-id='EX5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them, </span>
<span class='v EX5_21' data-id='EX5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and they said, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX5_22' data-id='EX5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Moses returned to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, “Why, Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Is this why you sent me? </span>
<span class='v EX5_23' data-id='EX5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and you have not rescued your people at all.” </span></div></div>
