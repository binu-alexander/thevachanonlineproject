<div class='s'>Paul’s Anguish Over Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_1' data-id='RM9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I speak the truth in Christ—I am not lying, my conscience confirms it through the Holy Spirit— </span>
<span class='v RM9_2' data-id='RM9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. </span>
<span class='v RM9_3' data-id='RM9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my people, those of my own race, </span>
<span class='v RM9_4' data-id='RM9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption to sonship; theirs the divine glory, the covenants, the receiving of the law, the temple worship and the promises. </span>
<span class='v RM9_5' data-id='RM9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, forever praised!<span class='note' id='footnote-2897'><a href='#note-2897' class='key'>*</a></span> Amen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God’s Sovereign Choice </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_6' data-id='RM9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It is not as though God’s word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. </span>
<span class='v RM9_7' data-id='RM9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nor because they are his descendants are they all Abraham’s children. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2898'><a href='#note-2898' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM9_8' data-id='RM9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham’s offspring. </span>
<span class='v RM9_9' data-id='RM9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this was how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2899'><a href='#note-2899' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_10' data-id='RM9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Not only that, but Rebekah’s children were conceived at the same time by our father Isaac. </span>
<span class='v RM9_11' data-id='RM9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Yet, before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad—in order that God’s purpose in election might stand: </span>
<span class='v RM9_12' data-id='RM9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>not by works but by him who calls—she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2900'><a href='#note-2900' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM9_13' data-id='RM9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2901'><a href='#note-2901' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_14' data-id='RM9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all! </span>
<span class='v RM9_15' data-id='RM9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For he says to Moses, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM9_15' data-id='RM9_15'>“I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM9_16' data-id='RM9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>It does not, therefore, depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy. </span>
<span class='v RM9_17' data-id='RM9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2903'><a href='#note-2903' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM9_18' data-id='RM9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_19' data-id='RM9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>One of you will say to me: “Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?” </span>
<span class='v RM9_20' data-id='RM9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, ‘Why did you make me like this?’ ”<span class='note' id='footnote-2904'><a href='#note-2904' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v RM9_21' data-id='RM9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_22' data-id='RM9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath—prepared for destruction? </span>
<span class='v RM9_23' data-id='RM9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory— </span>
<span class='v RM9_24' data-id='RM9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? </span>
<span class='v RM9_25' data-id='RM9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As he says in Hosea: </span></div>

<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>It is just as Isaiah said previously: </span></div>

<span class='v RM9_30' data-id='RM9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith; </span>
