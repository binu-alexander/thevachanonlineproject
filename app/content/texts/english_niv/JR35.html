<div class='s'>The Rekabites </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_1' data-id='JR35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> during the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah: </span>
<span class='v JR35_2' data-id='JR35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Go to the Rekabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and give them wine to drink.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_3' data-id='JR35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons—the whole family of the Rekabites. </span>
<span class='v JR35_4' data-id='JR35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I brought them into the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, into the room of the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah the man of God. It was next to the room of the officials, which was over that of Maaseiah son of Shallum the doorkeeper. </span>
<span class='v JR35_5' data-id='JR35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I set bowls full of wine and some cups before the Rekabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_6' data-id='JR35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our forefather Jehonadab<span class='note' id='footnote-1984'><a href='#note-1984' class='key'>*</a></span> son of Rekab gave us this command: ‘Neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine. </span>
<span class='v JR35_7' data-id='JR35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Also you must never build houses, sow seed or plant vineyards; you must never have any of these things, but must always live in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads.’ </span>
<span class='v JR35_8' data-id='JR35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>We have obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab son of Rekab commanded us. Neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine </span>
<span class='v JR35_9' data-id='JR35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>or built houses to live in or had vineyards, fields or crops. </span>
<span class='v JR35_10' data-id='JR35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather Jehonadab commanded us. </span>
<span class='v JR35_11' data-id='JR35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this land, we said, ‘Come, we must go to Jerusalem to escape the Babylonian<span class='note' id='footnote-1985'><a href='#note-1985' class='key'>†</a></span> and Aramean armies.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_12' data-id='JR35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah, saying: </span>
<span class='v JR35_13' data-id='JR35_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Go and tell the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘Will you not learn a lesson and obey my words?’ declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v JR35_14' data-id='JR35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>‘Jehonadab son of Rekab ordered his descendants not to drink wine and this command has been kept. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their forefather’s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have not obeyed me. </span>
<span class='v JR35_15' data-id='JR35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Again and again I sent all my servants the prophets to you. They said, “Each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not paid attention or listened to me. </span>
<span class='v JR35_16' data-id='JR35_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The descendants of Jehonadab son of Rekab have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but these people have not obeyed me.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_17' data-id='JR35_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Listen! I am going to bring on Judah and on everyone living in Jerusalem every disaster I pronounced against them. I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR35_18' data-id='JR35_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah said to the family of the Rekabites, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘You have obeyed the command of your forefather Jehonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered.’ </span>
<span class='v JR35_19' data-id='JR35_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Therefore this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jehonadab son of Rekab will never fail to have a descendant to serve me.’ ” </span></div></div>
