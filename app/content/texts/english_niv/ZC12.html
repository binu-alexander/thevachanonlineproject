<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC12_1' data-id='ZC12_1'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the human spirit within a person, declares: </span>
<span class='v ZC12_2' data-id='ZC12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling. Judah will be besieged as well as Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_3' data-id='ZC12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations. All who try to move it will injure themselves. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_4' data-id='ZC12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On that day I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness,” declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. “I will keep a watchful eye over Judah, but I will blind all the horses of the nations. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_5' data-id='ZC12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The people of Jerusalem are strong, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty is their God.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC12_6' data-id='ZC12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples right and left, but Jerusalem will remain intact in her place. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC12_7' data-id='ZC12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the honor of the house of David and of Jerusalem’s inhabitants may not be greater than that of Judah. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_8' data-id='ZC12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>On that day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will shield those who live in Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> going before them. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_9' data-id='ZC12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem. </span></div>

They will look on<span class='note' id='footnote-2424'><a href='#note-2424' class='key'>†</a></span> me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son. </span>
<span class='v ZC12_11' data-id='ZC12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>On that day the weeping in Jerusalem will be as great as the weeping of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. </span>
