<span class='v DT13_3' data-id='DT13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul. </span>
<span class='v DT13_4' data-id='DT13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him. </span>
