<div class='s'>Jehoahaz King of Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_1' data-id='K213_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years. </span>
<span class='v K213_2' data-id='K213_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> by following the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit, and he did not turn away from them. </span>
<span class='v K213_3' data-id='K213_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against Israel, and for a long time he kept them under the power of Hazael king of Aram and Ben-Hadad his son. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_4' data-id='K213_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Jehoahaz sought the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s favor, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> listened to him, for he saw how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel. </span>
<span class='v K213_5' data-id='K213_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> provided a deliverer for Israel, and they escaped from the power of Aram. So the Israelites lived in their own homes as they had before. </span>
<span class='v K213_6' data-id='K213_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he had caused Israel to commit; they continued in them. Also, the Asherah pole<span class='note' id='footnote-957'><a href='#note-957' class='key'>*</a></span> remained standing in Samaria. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_7' data-id='K213_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nothing had been left of the army of Jehoahaz except fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers, for the king of Aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_8' data-id='K213_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of the reign of Jehoahaz, all he did and his achievements, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K213_9' data-id='K213_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jehoahaz rested with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria. And Jehoash<span class='note' id='footnote-958'><a href='#note-958' class='key'>†</a></span> his son succeeded him as king. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jehoash King of Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_10' data-id='K213_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years. </span>
<span class='v K213_11' data-id='K213_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and did not turn away from any of the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, which he had caused Israel to commit; he continued in them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_12' data-id='K213_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for the other events of the reign of Jehoash, all he did and his achievements, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of Israel? </span>
<span class='v K213_13' data-id='K213_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jehoash rested with his ancestors, and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_14' data-id='K213_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now Elisha had been suffering from the illness from which he died. Jehoash king of Israel went down to see him and wept over him. “My father! My father!” he cried. “The chariots and horsemen of Israel!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_15' data-id='K213_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Elisha said, “Get a bow and some arrows,” and he did so. </span>
<span class='v K213_16' data-id='K213_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Take the bow in your hands,” he said to the king of Israel. When he had taken it, Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_17' data-id='K213_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Open the east window,” he said, and he opened it. “Shoot!” Elisha said, and he shot. “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Aram!” Elisha declared. “You will completely destroy the Arameans at Aphek.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_18' data-id='K213_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and the king took them. Elisha told him, “Strike the ground.” He struck it three times and stopped. </span>
<span class='v K213_19' data-id='K213_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The man of God was angry with him and said, “You should have struck the ground five or six times; then you would have defeated Aram and completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_20' data-id='K213_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Elisha died and was buried. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_20' data-id='K213_20'>Now Moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring. </span>
<span class='v K213_21' data-id='K213_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_22' data-id='K213_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz. </span>
<span class='v K213_23' data-id='K213_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. To this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his presence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K213_24' data-id='K213_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Hazael king of Aram died, and Ben-Hadad his son succeeded him as king. </span>
<span class='v K213_25' data-id='K213_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-Hadad son of Hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz. Three times Jehoash defeated him, and so he recovered the Israelite towns. </span></div></div>
