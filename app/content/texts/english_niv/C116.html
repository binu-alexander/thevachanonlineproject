<div class='s'>The Collection for the Lord’s People </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_1' data-id='C116_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now about the collection for the Lord’s people: Do what I told the Galatian churches to do. </span>
<span class='v C116_2' data-id='C116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with your income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. </span>
<span class='v C116_3' data-id='C116_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then, when I arrive, I will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v C116_4' data-id='C116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If it seems advisable for me to go also, they will accompany me. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Personal Requests </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_5' data-id='C116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>After I go through Macedonia, I will come to you—for I will be going through Macedonia. </span>
<span class='v C116_6' data-id='C116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Perhaps I will stay with you for a while, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go. </span>
<span class='v C116_7' data-id='C116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. </span>
<span class='v C116_8' data-id='C116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, </span>
<span class='v C116_9' data-id='C116_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>because a great door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many who oppose me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_10' data-id='C116_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is carrying on the work of the Lord, just as I am. </span>
<span class='v C116_11' data-id='C116_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me. I am expecting him along with the brothers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_12' data-id='C116_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was quite unwilling to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_13' data-id='C116_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong. </span>
<span class='v C116_14' data-id='C116_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do everything in love. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_15' data-id='C116_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the Lord’s people. I urge you, brothers and sisters, </span>
<span class='v C116_16' data-id='C116_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to submit to such people and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it. </span>
<span class='v C116_17' data-id='C116_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I was glad when Stephanas, Fortunatus and Achaicus arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you. </span>
<span class='v C116_18' data-id='C116_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Such men deserve recognition. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Greetings </div>
