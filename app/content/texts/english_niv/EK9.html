<div class='c'>9</div>
<div class='s'>Judgment on the Idolaters </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_1' data-id='EK9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I heard him call out in a loud voice, “Bring near those who are appointed to execute judgment on the city, each with a weapon in his hand.” </span>
<span class='v EK9_2' data-id='EK9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_3' data-id='EK9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the cherubim, where it had been, and moved to the threshold of the temple. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side </span>
<span class='v EK9_4' data-id='EK9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_5' data-id='EK9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As I listened, he said to the others, “Follow him through the city and kill, without showing pity or compassion. </span>
<span class='v EK9_6' data-id='EK9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, the mothers and children, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the old men who were in front of the temple. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_7' data-id='EK9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain. Go!” So they went out and began killing throughout the city. </span>
<span class='v EK9_8' data-id='EK9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>While they were killing and I was left alone, I fell facedown, crying out, “Alas, Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>! Are you going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel in this outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_9' data-id='EK9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He answered me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice. They say, ‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has forsaken the land; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> does not see.’ </span>
<span class='v EK9_10' data-id='EK9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I will not look on them with pity or spare them, but I will bring down on their own heads what they have done.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK9_11' data-id='EK9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded.” </span></div></div>
