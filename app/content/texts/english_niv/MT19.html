<span class='v MT19_2' data-id='MT19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_3' data-id='MT19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Some Pharisees came to him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_4' data-id='MT19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Haven’t you read,”</span> he replied, <span class='wj'>“that at the beginning the Creator ‘made them male and female,’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2508'><a href='#note-2508' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v MT19_5' data-id='MT19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and said, ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh’</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2509'><a href='#note-2509' class='key'>†</a></span><span class='wj'>?</span></span>
<span class='v MT19_6' data-id='MT19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate.”</span></span></div>

<span class='v MT19_7' data-id='MT19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Why then,” they asked, “did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_8' data-id='MT19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning.</span></span>
<span class='v MT19_9' data-id='MT19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_10' data-id='MT19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, “If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_11' data-id='MT19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given.</span></span>
<span class='v MT19_12' data-id='MT19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For there are eunuchs who were born that way, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by others—and there are those who choose to live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_13' data-id='MT19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples rebuked them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_14' data-id='MT19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_22' data-id='MT19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_23' data-id='MT19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span></span>
<span class='v MT19_24' data-id='MT19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</span></span></div>
