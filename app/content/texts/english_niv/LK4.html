<span class='v LK4_17' data-id='LK4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_20' data-id='LK4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. </span>
<span class='v LK4_21' data-id='LK4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He began by saying to them, <span class='wj'>“Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.”</span></span></div>

<span class='v LK4_22' data-id='LK4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?” they asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_23' data-id='LK4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ And you will tell me, ‘Do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.’ ”</span></span></div>

<span class='v LK4_25' data-id='LK4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I assure you that there were many widows in Israel in Elijah’s time, when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land.</span></span>
<span class='v LK4_26' data-id='LK4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to a widow in Zarephath in the region of Sidon.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_28' data-id='LK4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>All the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this. </span>
<span class='v LK4_29' data-id='LK4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They got up, drove him out of the town, and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built, in order to throw him off the cliff. </span>

<span class='v LK4_31' data-id='LK4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he taught the people. </span>
<span class='v LK4_32' data-id='LK4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They were amazed at his teaching, because his words had authority. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_33' data-id='LK4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>In the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon, an impure spirit. He cried out at the top of his voice, </span>
<span class='v LK4_34' data-id='LK4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“Go away! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_35' data-id='LK4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Be quiet!”</span> Jesus said sternly. <span class='wj'>“Come out of him!”</span> Then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_36' data-id='LK4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>All the people were amazed and said to each other, “What words these are! With authority and power he gives orders to impure spirits and they come out!” </span>
<span class='v LK4_37' data-id='LK4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_38' data-id='LK4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. </span>
<span class='v LK4_39' data-id='LK4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So he bent over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began to wait on them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_40' data-id='LK4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>At sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them. </span>
<span class='v LK4_41' data-id='LK4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Moreover, demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_42' data-id='LK4_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>At daybreak, Jesus went out to a solitary place. The people were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them. </span>
<span class='v LK4_43' data-id='LK4_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>But he said, <span class='wj'>“I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because that is why I was sent.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK4_44' data-id='LK4_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea. </span></div></div>
