<div class='s'>David Hears of Saul’s Death </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_1' data-id='S21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the death of Saul, David returned from striking down the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag two days. </span>
<span class='v S21_2' data-id='S21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>On the third day a man arrived from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he came to David, he fell to the ground to pay him honor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_3' data-id='S21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Where have you come from?” David asked him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_3' data-id='S21_3'>He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_4' data-id='S21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“What happened?” David asked. “Tell me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_4' data-id='S21_4'>“The men fled from the battle,” he replied. “Many of them fell and died. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_5' data-id='S21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then David said to the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_6' data-id='S21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said, “and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and their drivers in hot pursuit. </span>
<span class='v S21_7' data-id='S21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, and I said, ‘What can I do?’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_8' data-id='S21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_8' data-id='S21_8'>“ ‘An Amalekite,’ I answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_9' data-id='S21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Then he said to me, ‘Stand here by me and kill me! I’m in the throes of death, but I’m still alive.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_10' data-id='S21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“So I stood beside him and killed him, because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive. And I took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_11' data-id='S21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then David and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them. </span>
<span class='v S21_12' data-id='S21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They mourned and wept and fasted till evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the army of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and for the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_13' data-id='S21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>David said to the young man who brought him the report, “Where are you from?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_13' data-id='S21_13'>“I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite,” he answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_14' data-id='S21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>David asked him, “Why weren’t you afraid to lift your hand to destroy the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_15' data-id='S21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then David called one of his men and said, “Go, strike him down!” So he struck him down, and he died. </span>
<span class='v S21_16' data-id='S21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For David had said to him, “Your blood be on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointed.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>David’s Lament for Saul and Jonathan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_17' data-id='S21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>David took up this lament concerning Saul and his son Jonathan, </span>
<span class='v S21_18' data-id='S21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this lament of the bow (it is written in the Book of Jashar): </span></div>
