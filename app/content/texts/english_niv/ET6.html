<div class='s'>Mordecai Honored </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_1' data-id='ET6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>That night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him. </span>
<span class='v ET6_2' data-id='ET6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It was found recorded there that Mordecai had exposed Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, who had conspired to assassinate King Xerxes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_3' data-id='ET6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“What honor and recognition has Mordecai received for this?” the king asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_3' data-id='ET6_3'>“Nothing has been done for him,” his attendants answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_4' data-id='ET6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about impaling Mordecai on the pole he had set up for him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_5' data-id='ET6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>His attendants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_5' data-id='ET6_5'>“Bring him in,” the king ordered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_6' data-id='ET6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Haman entered, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king delights to honor?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_6' data-id='ET6_6'>Now Haman thought to himself, “Who is there that the king would rather honor than me?” </span>
<span class='v ET6_7' data-id='ET6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So he answered the king, “For the man the king delights to honor, </span>
<span class='v ET6_8' data-id='ET6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden, one with a royal crest placed on its head. </span>
<span class='v ET6_9' data-id='ET6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble princes. Let them robe the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through the city streets, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_10' data-id='ET6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Go at once,” the king commanded Haman. “Get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_11' data-id='ET6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Haman got the robe and the horse. He robed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city streets, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_12' data-id='ET6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Afterward Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman rushed home, with his head covered in grief, </span>
<span class='v ET6_13' data-id='ET6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and told Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ET6_13' data-id='ET6_13'>His advisers and his wife Zeresh said to him, “Since Mordecai, before whom your downfall has started, is of Jewish origin, you cannot stand against him—you will surely come to ruin!” </span>
<span class='v ET6_14' data-id='ET6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>While they were still talking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurried Haman away to the banquet Esther had prepared. </span></div></div>
