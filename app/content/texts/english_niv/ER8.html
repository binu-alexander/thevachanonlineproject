<div class='s'>The Return to Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_15' data-id='ER8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I assembled them at the canal that flows toward Ahava, and we camped there three days. When I checked among the people and the priests, I found no Levites there. </span>
<span class='v ER8_16' data-id='ER8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam, who were leaders, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of learning, </span>
<span class='v ER8_17' data-id='ER8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and I ordered them to go to Iddo, the leader in Kasiphia. I told them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Kasiphia, so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our God. </span>
<span class='v ER8_18' data-id='ER8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because the gracious hand of our God was on us, they brought us Sherebiah, a capable man, from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, the son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in all; </span>
<span class='v ER8_19' data-id='ER8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews, 20 in all. </span>
<span class='v ER8_20' data-id='ER8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They also brought 220 of the temple servants—a body that David and the officials had established to assist the Levites. All were registered by name. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_21' data-id='ER8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>There, by the Ahava Canal, I proclaimed a fast, so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children, with all our possessions. </span>
<span class='v ER8_22' data-id='ER8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him, but his great anger is against all who forsake him.” </span>
<span class='v ER8_23' data-id='ER8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_24' data-id='ER8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, namely, Sherebiah, Hashabiah and ten of their brothers, </span>
<span class='v ER8_25' data-id='ER8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and I weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king, his advisers, his officials and all Israel present there had donated for the house of our God. </span>
<span class='v ER8_26' data-id='ER8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I weighed out to them 650 talents<span class='note' id='footnote-1261'><a href='#note-1261' class='key'>‡</a></span> of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents,<span class='note' id='footnote-1262'><a href='#note-1262' class='key'>§</a></span> 100 talents<span class='note' id='footnote-1263'><a href='#note-1263' class='key'>*</a></span> of gold, </span>
<span class='v ER8_27' data-id='ER8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>20 bowls of gold valued at 1,000 darics,<span class='note' id='footnote-1264'><a href='#note-1264' class='key'>†</a></span> and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_28' data-id='ER8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I said to them, “You as well as these articles are consecrated to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. The silver and gold are a freewill offering to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors. </span>
<span class='v ER8_29' data-id='ER8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in Jerusalem before the leading priests and the Levites and the family heads of Israel.” </span>
<span class='v ER8_30' data-id='ER8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then the priests and Levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_31' data-id='ER8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>On the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the Ahava Canal to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was on us, and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way. </span>
<span class='v ER8_32' data-id='ER8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So we arrived in Jerusalem, where we rested three days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_33' data-id='ER8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. </span>
<span class='v ER8_34' data-id='ER8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER8_35' data-id='ER8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs and, as a sin offering,<span class='note' id='footnote-1265'><a href='#note-1265' class='key'>‡</a></span> twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v ER8_36' data-id='ER8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>They also delivered the king’s orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates, who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of God. </span></div></div>
