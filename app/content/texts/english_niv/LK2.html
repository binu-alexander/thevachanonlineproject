<div class='s'>The Birth of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_1' data-id='LK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. </span>
<span class='v LK2_2' data-id='LK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>(This was the first census that took place while<span class='note' id='footnote-2626'><a href='#note-2626' class='key'>*</a></span> Quirinius was governor of Syria.) </span>
<span class='v LK2_3' data-id='LK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And everyone went to their own town to register. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_4' data-id='LK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. </span>
<span class='v LK2_5' data-id='LK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. </span>
<span class='v LK2_6' data-id='LK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, </span>
<span class='v LK2_7' data-id='LK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_8' data-id='LK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. </span>
<span class='v LK2_9' data-id='LK2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. </span>
<span class='v LK2_10' data-id='LK2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. </span>
<span class='v LK2_11' data-id='LK2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK2_12' data-id='LK2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_13' data-id='LK2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Glory to God in the highest heaven, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'>and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_15' data-id='LK2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_16' data-id='LK2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. </span>
<span class='v LK2_17' data-id='LK2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, </span>
<span class='v LK2_18' data-id='LK2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. </span>
<span class='v LK2_19' data-id='LK2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. </span>
<span class='v LK2_20' data-id='LK2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_21' data-id='LK2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Presented in the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_22' data-id='LK2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When the time came for the purification rites required by the Law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord </span>
<span class='v LK2_23' data-id='LK2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the Lord”<span class='note' id='footnote-2627'><a href='#note-2627' class='key'>†</a></span>), </span>
<span class='v LK2_24' data-id='LK2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the Lord: “a pair of doves or two young pigeons.”<span class='note' id='footnote-2628'><a href='#note-2628' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_25' data-id='LK2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon, who was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_26' data-id='LK2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah. </span>
<span class='v LK2_27' data-id='LK2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, </span>
<span class='v LK2_28' data-id='LK2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'>you may now dismiss<span class='note' id='footnote-2629'><a href='#note-2629' class='key'>§</a></span> your servant in peace. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_30' data-id='LK2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For my eyes have seen your salvation, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_31' data-id='LK2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>which you have prepared in the sight of all nations: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>a light for revelation to the Gentiles, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'>and the glory of your people Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_33' data-id='LK2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The child’s father and mother marveled at what was said about him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_34' data-id='LK2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: “This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken against, </span>
<span class='v LK2_35' data-id='LK2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_36' data-id='LK2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>There was also a prophet, Anna, the daughter of Penuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage, </span>
<span class='v LK2_37' data-id='LK2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and then was a widow until she was eighty-four.<span class='note' id='footnote-2630'><a href='#note-2630' class='key'>*</a></span> She never left the temple but worshiped night and day, fasting and praying. </span>
<span class='v LK2_38' data-id='LK2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Coming up to them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_39' data-id='LK2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>When Joseph and Mary had done everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth. </span>
<span class='v LK2_40' data-id='LK2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was on him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Boy Jesus at the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_41' data-id='LK2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Festival of the Passover. </span>
<span class='v LK2_42' data-id='LK2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival, according to the custom. </span>
<span class='v LK2_43' data-id='LK2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>After the festival was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. </span>
<span class='v LK2_44' data-id='LK2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on for a day. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. </span>
<span class='v LK2_45' data-id='LK2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_46' data-id='LK2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. </span>
<span class='v LK2_47' data-id='LK2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. </span>
<span class='v LK2_48' data-id='LK2_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_49' data-id='LK2_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Why were you searching for me?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Didn’t you know I had to be in my Father’s house?”</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2631'><a href='#note-2631' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v LK2_50' data-id='LK2_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>But they did not understand what he was saying to them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_51' data-id='LK2_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. </span>
<span class='v LK2_52' data-id='LK2_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man. </span></div></div>
