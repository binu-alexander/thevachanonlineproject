<div class='s'>Naomi Loses Her Husband and Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_1' data-id='RT1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the days when the judges ruled,<span class='note' id='footnote-660'><a href='#note-660' class='key'>*</a></span> there was a famine in the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah, together with his wife and two sons, went to live for a while in the country of Moab. </span>
<span class='v RT1_2' data-id='RT1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The man’s name was Elimelek, his wife’s name was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. And they went to Moab and lived there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_3' data-id='RT1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Elimelek, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons. </span>
<span class='v RT1_4' data-id='RT1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They married Moabite women, one named Orpah and the other Ruth. After they had lived there about ten years, </span>
<span class='v RT1_5' data-id='RT1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>both Mahlon and Kilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two sons and her husband. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Naomi and Ruth Return to Bethlehem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_6' data-id='RT1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Naomi heard in Moab that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them, she and her daughters-in-law prepared to return home from there. </span>
<span class='v RT1_7' data-id='RT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>With her two daughters-in-law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of Judah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_8' data-id='RT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s home. May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> show you kindness, as you have shown kindness to your dead husbands and to me. </span>
<span class='v RT1_9' data-id='RT1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_9' data-id='RT1_9'>Then she kissed them goodbye and they wept aloud </span>
<span class='v RT1_10' data-id='RT1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and said to her, “We will go back with you to your people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_11' data-id='RT1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husbands? </span>
<span class='v RT1_12' data-id='RT1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Return home, my daughters; I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me—even if I had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons— </span>
<span class='v RT1_13' data-id='RT1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>would you wait until they grew up? Would you remain unmarried for them? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s hand has turned against me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_14' data-id='RT1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_15' data-id='RT1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_16' data-id='RT1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. </span>
<span class='v RT1_17' data-id='RT1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.” </span>
<span class='v RT1_18' data-id='RT1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_19' data-id='RT1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So the two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Can this be Naomi?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_20' data-id='RT1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Don’t call me Naomi,<span class='note' id='footnote-661'><a href='#note-661' class='key'>†</a></span>” she told them. “Call me Mara,<span class='note' id='footnote-662'><a href='#note-662' class='key'>‡</a></span> because the Almighty<span class='note' id='footnote-663'><a href='#note-663' class='key'>§</a></span> has made my life very bitter. </span>
<span class='v RT1_21' data-id='RT1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I went away full, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has afflicted<span class='note' id='footnote-664'><a href='#note-664' class='key'>*</a></span> me; the Almighty has brought misfortune upon me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT1_22' data-id='RT1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So Naomi returned from Moab accompanied by Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning. </span></div></div>
