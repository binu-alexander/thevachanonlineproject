<span class='v MK5_1' data-id='MK5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>They went across the lake to the region of the Gerasenes.<span class='note' id='footnote-2561'><a href='#note-2561' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v MK5_2' data-id='MK5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an impure spirit came from the tombs to meet him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_3' data-id='MK5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This man lived in the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. </span>
<span class='v MK5_4' data-id='MK5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For he had often been chained hand and foot, but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet. No one was strong enough to subdue him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_5' data-id='MK5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_6' data-id='MK5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell on his knees in front of him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_7' data-id='MK5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He shouted at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!” </span>
<span class='v MK5_8' data-id='MK5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had said to him, <span class='wj'>“Come out of this man, you impure spirit!”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_9' data-id='MK5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus asked him, <span class='wj'>“What is your name?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_9' data-id='MK5_9'>“My name is Legion,” he replied, “for we are many.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_10' data-id='MK5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of the area. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_11' data-id='MK5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside. </span>
<span class='v MK5_12' data-id='MK5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The demons begged Jesus, “Send us among the pigs; allow us to go into them.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_13' data-id='MK5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He gave them permission, and the impure spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_14' data-id='MK5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. </span>
<span class='v MK5_15' data-id='MK5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. </span>
<span class='v MK5_16' data-id='MK5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man—and told about the pigs as well. </span>
<span class='v MK5_17' data-id='MK5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_18' data-id='MK5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_19' data-id='MK5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus did not let him, but said, <span class='wj'>“Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK5_20' data-id='MK5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So the man went away and began to tell in the Decapolis<span class='note' id='footnote-2562'><a href='#note-2562' class='key'>†</a></span> how much Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_21' data-id='MK5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. </span>
<span class='v MK5_22' data-id='MK5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. </span>
<span class='v MK5_23' data-id='MK5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_24' data-id='MK5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Jesus went with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_24' data-id='MK5_24'>A large crowd followed and pressed around him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_25' data-id='MK5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. </span>
<span class='v MK5_26' data-id='MK5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. </span>
<span class='v MK5_27' data-id='MK5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, </span>
<span class='v MK5_28' data-id='MK5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” </span>
<span class='v MK5_29' data-id='MK5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_30' data-id='MK5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, <span class='wj'>“Who touched my clothes?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_31' data-id='MK5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>“You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, <span class='wj'>‘Who touched me?’</span> ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_32' data-id='MK5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. </span>
<span class='v MK5_33' data-id='MK5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. </span>
<span class='v MK5_34' data-id='MK5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>He said to her, <span class='wj'>“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_35' data-id='MK5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_36' data-id='MK5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Overhearing<span class='note' id='footnote-2563'><a href='#note-2563' class='key'>‡</a></span> what they said, Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid; just believe.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_37' data-id='MK5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. </span>
<span class='v MK5_38' data-id='MK5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. </span>
<span class='v MK5_39' data-id='MK5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He went in and said to them, <span class='wj'>“Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK5_40' data-id='MK5_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But they laughed at him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK5_40' data-id='MK5_40'>After he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. </span>
<span class='v MK5_41' data-id='MK5_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>He took her by the hand and said to her, <span class='tl'>“Talitha koum!”</span> (which means <span class='wj'>“Little girl, I say to you, get up!”</span>). </span>
<span class='v MK5_42' data-id='MK5_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. </span>
<span class='v MK5_43' data-id='MK5_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat. </span></div></div>
