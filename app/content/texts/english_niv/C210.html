<div class='s'>Paul’s Defense of His Ministry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C210_1' data-id='C210_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal to you—I, Paul, who am “timid” when face to face with you, but “bold” toward you when away! </span>
<span class='v C210_2' data-id='C210_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I beg you that when I come I may not have to be as bold as I expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world. </span>
<span class='v C210_3' data-id='C210_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. </span>
<span class='v C210_4' data-id='C210_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds. </span>
<span class='v C210_5' data-id='C210_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ. </span>
<span class='v C210_6' data-id='C210_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C210_7' data-id='C210_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You are judging by appearances.<span class='note' id='footnote-3032'><a href='#note-3032' class='key'>*</a></span> If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should consider again that we belong to Christ just as much as they do. </span>
<span class='v C210_8' data-id='C210_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it. </span>
<span class='v C210_9' data-id='C210_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters. </span>
<span class='v C210_10' data-id='C210_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing.” </span>
<span class='v C210_11' data-id='C210_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C210_12' data-id='C210_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are not wise. </span>
<span class='v C210_13' data-id='C210_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you. </span>
<span class='v C210_14' data-id='C210_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ. </span>
<span class='v C210_15' data-id='C210_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand, </span>
<span class='v C210_16' data-id='C210_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work already done in someone else’s territory. </span>
<span class='v C210_17' data-id='C210_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3033'><a href='#note-3033' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v C210_18' data-id='C210_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. </span></div></div>
