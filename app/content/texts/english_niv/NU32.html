<span class='v NU32_1' data-id='NU32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock. </span>
<span class='v NU32_2' data-id='NU32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So they came to Moses and Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community, and said, </span>
<span class='v NU32_3' data-id='NU32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon— </span>
<span class='v NU32_4' data-id='NU32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> subdued before the people of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock. </span>
<span class='v NU32_5' data-id='NU32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If we have found favor in your eyes,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as our possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_6' data-id='NU32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here? </span>
<span class='v NU32_7' data-id='NU32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Why do you discourage the Israelites from crossing over into the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given them? </span>
<span class='v NU32_8' data-id='NU32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look over the land. </span>
<span class='v NU32_9' data-id='NU32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After they went up to the Valley of Eshkol and viewed the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had given them. </span>
<span class='v NU32_10' data-id='NU32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath: </span>
<span class='v NU32_11' data-id='NU32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>‘Because they have not followed me wholeheartedly, not one of those who were twenty years old or more when they came up out of Egypt will see the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob— </span>
<span class='v NU32_12' data-id='NU32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they followed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> wholeheartedly.’ </span>
<span class='v NU32_13' data-id='NU32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against Israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_14' data-id='NU32_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“And here you are, a brood of sinners, standing in the place of your fathers and making the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> even more angry with Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU32_15' data-id='NU32_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If you turn away from following him, he will again leave all this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_16' data-id='NU32_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then they came up to him and said, “We would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children. </span>
<span class='v NU32_17' data-id='NU32_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But we will arm ourselves for battle<span class='note' id='footnote-497'><a href='#note-497' class='key'>*</a></span> and go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them to their place. Meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities, for protection from the inhabitants of the land. </span>
<span class='v NU32_18' data-id='NU32_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has received their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v NU32_19' data-id='NU32_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_20' data-id='NU32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Moses said to them, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for battle </span>
<span class='v NU32_21' data-id='NU32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> until he has driven his enemies out before him— </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_23' data-id='NU32_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“But if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. </span>
<span class='v NU32_24' data-id='NU32_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_25' data-id='NU32_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We your servants will do as our lord commands. </span>
<span class='v NU32_26' data-id='NU32_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Our children and wives, our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of Gilead. </span>
<span class='v NU32_27' data-id='NU32_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But your servants, every man who is armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, just as our lord says.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_28' data-id='NU32_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun and to the family heads of the Israelite tribes. </span>
<span class='v NU32_29' data-id='NU32_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, then when the land is subdued before you, you must give them the land of Gilead as their possession. </span>
<span class='v NU32_30' data-id='NU32_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their possession with you in Canaan.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_31' data-id='NU32_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “Your servants will do what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has said. </span>
<span class='v NU32_32' data-id='NU32_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>We will cross over before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> into Canaan armed, but the property we inherit will be on this side of the Jordan.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_33' data-id='NU32_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then Moses gave to the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the whole land with its cities and the territory around them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_34' data-id='NU32_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, </span>

<span class='v NU32_36' data-id='NU32_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran as fortified cities, and built pens for their flocks. </span>
<span class='v NU32_37' data-id='NU32_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And the Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh and Kiriathaim, </span>
<span class='v NU32_38' data-id='NU32_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>as well as Nebo and Baal Meon (these names were changed) and Sibmah. They gave names to the cities they rebuilt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU32_39' data-id='NU32_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>The descendants of Makir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it and drove out the Amorites who were there. </span>
<span class='v NU32_40' data-id='NU32_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, the descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there. </span>
