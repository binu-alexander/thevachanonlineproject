In future years you will invade a land that has recovered from war, whose people were gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate. They had been brought out from the nations, and now all of them live in safety. </span>
<span class='v EK38_9' data-id='EK38_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You and all your troops and the many nations with you will go up, advancing like a storm; you will be like a cloud covering the land. </span></div>
