<span class='v R25_1' data-id='R25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When all the work Solomon had done for the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was finished, he brought in the things his father David had dedicated—the silver and gold and all the furnishings—and he placed them in the treasuries of God’s temple. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ark Brought to the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R25_2' data-id='R25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the Israelite families, to bring up the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant from Zion, the City of David. </span>
<span class='v R25_3' data-id='R25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And all the Israelites came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R25_4' data-id='R25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When all the elders of Israel had arrived, the Levites took up the ark, </span>
<span class='v R25_5' data-id='R25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it. The Levitical priests carried them up; </span>
<span class='v R25_6' data-id='R25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and King Solomon and the entire assembly of Israel that had gathered about him were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R25_7' data-id='R25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The priests then brought the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple, the Most Holy Place, and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim. </span>
<span class='v R25_8' data-id='R25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles. </span>
<span class='v R25_9' data-id='R25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>These poles were so long that their ends, extending from the ark, could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary, but not from outside the Holy Place; and they are still there today. </span>
<span class='v R25_10' data-id='R25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had placed in it at Horeb, where the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> made a covenant with the Israelites after they came out of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R25_11' data-id='R25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The priests then withdrew from the Holy Place. All the priests who were there had consecrated themselves, regardless of their divisions. </span>
<span class='v R25_12' data-id='R25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All the Levites who were musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun and their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar, dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals, harps and lyres. They were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets. </span>
<span class='v R25_13' data-id='R25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and sang: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v R25_13' data-id='R25_13'>“He is good; </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R25_13' data-id='R25_13'>Then the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was filled with the cloud, </span>
<span class='v R25_14' data-id='R25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> filled the temple of God. </span></div></div>
