<div class='s'>Closing Appeal for Steadfastness and Unity </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_1' data-id='PP4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_2' data-id='PP4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I plead with Euodia and I plead with Syntyche to be of the same mind in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PP4_3' data-id='PP4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yes, and I ask you, my true companion, help these women since they have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are in the book of life. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Exhortations </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_4' data-id='PP4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! </span>
<span class='v PP4_5' data-id='PP4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. </span>
<span class='v PP4_6' data-id='PP4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. </span>
<span class='v PP4_7' data-id='PP4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_8' data-id='PP4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. </span>
<span class='v PP4_9' data-id='PP4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Thanks for Their Gifts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_10' data-id='PP4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. </span>
<span class='v PP4_11' data-id='PP4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. </span>
<span class='v PP4_12' data-id='PP4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. </span>
<span class='v PP4_13' data-id='PP4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I can do all this through him who gives me strength. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_14' data-id='PP4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Yet it was good of you to share in my troubles. </span>
<span class='v PP4_15' data-id='PP4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; </span>
<span class='v PP4_16' data-id='PP4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. </span>
<span class='v PP4_17' data-id='PP4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Not that I desire your gifts; what I desire is that more be credited to your account. </span>
<span class='v PP4_18' data-id='PP4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent. They are a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God. </span>
<span class='v PP4_19' data-id='PP4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_20' data-id='PP4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Greetings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_21' data-id='PP4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Greet all God’s people in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send greetings. </span>
<span class='v PP4_22' data-id='PP4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>All God’s people here send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_23' data-id='PP4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.<span class='note' id='footnote-3093'><a href='#note-3093' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div></div>
