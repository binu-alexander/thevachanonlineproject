<div class='c'>18</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_1' data-id='S218_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. </span>
<span class='v S218_2' data-id='S218_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>David sent out his troops, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai the Gittite. The king told the troops, “I myself will surely march out with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_3' data-id='S218_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the men said, “You must not go out; if we are forced to flee, they won’t care about us. Even if half of us die, they won’t care; but you are worth ten thousand of us.<span class='note' id='footnote-793'><a href='#note-793' class='key'>*</a></span> It would be better now for you to give us support from the city.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_4' data-id='S218_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The king answered, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_4' data-id='S218_4'>So the king stood beside the gate while all his men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands. </span>
<span class='v S218_5' data-id='S218_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The king commanded Joab, Abishai and Ittai, “Be gentle with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning Absalom to each of the commanders. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_6' data-id='S218_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>David’s army marched out of the city to fight Israel, and the battle took place in the forest of Ephraim. </span>
<span class='v S218_7' data-id='S218_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There Israel’s troops were routed by David’s men, and the casualties that day were great—twenty thousand men. </span>
<span class='v S218_8' data-id='S218_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The battle spread out over the whole countryside, and the forest swallowed up more men that day than the sword. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_9' data-id='S218_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now Absalom happened to meet David’s men. He was riding his mule, and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak, Absalom’s hair got caught in the tree. He was left hanging in midair, while the mule he was riding kept on going. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_10' data-id='S218_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When one of the men saw what had happened, he told Joab, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_11' data-id='S218_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Joab said to the man who had told him this, “What! You saw him? Why didn’t you strike him to the ground right there? Then I would have had to give you ten shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-794'><a href='#note-794' class='key'>†</a></span> of silver and a warrior’s belt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_12' data-id='S218_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the man replied, “Even if a thousand shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-795'><a href='#note-795' class='key'>‡</a></span> were weighed out into my hands, I would not lay a hand on the king’s son. In our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, ‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.<span class='note' id='footnote-796'><a href='#note-796' class='key'>§</a></span>’ </span>
<span class='v S218_13' data-id='S218_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And if I had put my life in jeopardy<span class='note' id='footnote-797'><a href='#note-797' class='key'>*</a></span>—and nothing is hidden from the king—you would have kept your distance from me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_14' data-id='S218_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Joab said, “I’m not going to wait like this for you.” So he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into Absalom’s heart while Absalom was still alive in the oak tree. </span>
<span class='v S218_15' data-id='S218_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And ten of Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him and killed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_16' data-id='S218_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Joab sounded the trumpet, and the troops stopped pursuing Israel, for Joab halted them. </span>
<span class='v S218_17' data-id='S218_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They took Absalom, threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him. Meanwhile, all the Israelites fled to their homes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_18' data-id='S218_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>During his lifetime Absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the King’s Valley as a monument to himself, for he thought, “I have no son to carry on the memory of my name.” He named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day. </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Mourns </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_19' data-id='S218_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now Ahimaaz son of Zadok said, “Let me run and take the news to the king that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_20' data-id='S218_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“You are not the one to take the news today,” Joab told him. “You may take the news another time, but you must not do so today, because the king’s son is dead.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_21' data-id='S218_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Joab said to a Cushite, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed down before Joab and ran off. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_22' data-id='S218_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Ahimaaz son of Zadok again said to Joab, “Come what may, please let me run behind the Cushite.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_22' data-id='S218_22'>But Joab replied, “My son, why do you want to go? You don’t have any news that will bring you a reward.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_23' data-id='S218_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He said, “Come what may, I want to run.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_23' data-id='S218_23'>So Joab said, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain<span class='note' id='footnote-798'><a href='#note-798' class='key'>†</a></span> and outran the Cushite. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_24' data-id='S218_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates, the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked out, he saw a man running alone. </span>
<span class='v S218_25' data-id='S218_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The watchman called out to the king and reported it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_25' data-id='S218_25'>The king said, “If he is alone, he must have good news.” And the runner came closer and closer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_26' data-id='S218_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then the watchman saw another runner, and he called down to the gatekeeper, “Look, another man running alone!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_26' data-id='S218_26'>The king said, “He must be bringing good news, too.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_27' data-id='S218_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The watchman said, “It seems to me that the first one runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_27' data-id='S218_27'>“He’s a good man,” the king said. “He comes with good news.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_28' data-id='S218_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well!” He bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise be to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God! He has delivered up those who lifted their hands against my lord the king.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_29' data-id='S218_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_29' data-id='S218_29'>Ahimaaz answered, “I saw great confusion just as Joab was about to send the king’s servant and me, your servant, but I don’t know what it was.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_30' data-id='S218_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The king said, “Stand aside and wait here.” So he stepped aside and stood there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_31' data-id='S218_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then the Cushite arrived and said, “My lord the king, hear the good news! The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has vindicated you today by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_32' data-id='S218_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_32' data-id='S218_32'>The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S218_33' data-id='S218_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The king was shaken. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he said: “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you—O Absalom, my son, my son!”<span class='note' id='footnote-799'><a href='#note-799' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div></div>
