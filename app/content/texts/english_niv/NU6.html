<span class='v NU6_3' data-id='NU6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>they must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or other fermented drink. They must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins. </span>
<span class='v NU6_4' data-id='NU6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As long as they remain under their Nazirite vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins. </span></div>

<span class='v NU6_5' data-id='NU6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“ ‘During the entire period of their Nazirite vow, no razor may be used on their head. They must be holy until the period of their dedication to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is over; they must let their hair grow long. </span></div>

<span class='v NU6_6' data-id='NU6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Throughout the period of their dedication to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the Nazirite must not go near a dead body. </span>
<span class='v NU6_7' data-id='NU6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Even if their own father or mother or brother or sister dies, they must not make themselves ceremonially unclean on account of them, because the symbol of their dedication to God is on their head. </span>

<span class='v NU6_10' data-id='NU6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then on the eighth day they must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v NU6_11' data-id='NU6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The priest is to offer one as a sin offering<span class='note' id='footnote-433'><a href='#note-433' class='key'>*</a></span> and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for the Nazirite because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead body.

<span class='v NU6_20' data-id='NU6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The priest shall then wave these before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as a wave offering; they are holy and belong to the priest, together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented.
