<div class='s'>Abijah King of Judah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_1' data-id='R213_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam, Abijah became king of Judah, </span>
<span class='v R213_2' data-id='R213_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother’s name was Maakah,<span class='note' id='footnote-1171'><a href='#note-1171' class='key'>*</a></span> a daughter<span class='note' id='footnote-1172'><a href='#note-1172' class='key'>†</a></span> of Uriel of Gibeah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_2' data-id='R213_2'>There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. </span>
<span class='v R213_3' data-id='R213_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Abijah went into battle with an army of four hundred thousand able fighting men, and Jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_4' data-id='R213_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim, in the hill country of Ephraim, and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! </span>
<span class='v R213_5' data-id='R213_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Don’t you know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has given the kingship of Israel to David and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt? </span>
<span class='v R213_6' data-id='R213_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, an official of Solomon son of David, rebelled against his master. </span>
<span class='v R213_7' data-id='R213_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed Rehoboam son of Solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_8' data-id='R213_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“And now you plan to resist the kingdom of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, which is in the hands of David’s descendants. You are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods. </span>
<span class='v R213_9' data-id='R213_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But didn’t you drive out the priests of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do? Whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_10' data-id='R213_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“As for us, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is our God, and we have not forsaken him. The priests who serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> are sons of Aaron, and the Levites assist them. </span>
<span class='v R213_11' data-id='R213_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. They set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening. We are observing the requirements of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God. But you have forsaken him. </span>
<span class='v R213_12' data-id='R213_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>God is with us; he is our leader. His priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you. People of Israel, do not fight against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_13' data-id='R213_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now Jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear, so that while he was in front of Judah the ambush was behind them. </span>
<span class='v R213_14' data-id='R213_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear. Then they cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. The priests blew their trumpets </span>
<span class='v R213_15' data-id='R213_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. At the sound of their battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. </span>
<span class='v R213_16' data-id='R213_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The Israelites fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hands. </span>
<span class='v R213_17' data-id='R213_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Abijah and his troops inflicted heavy losses on them, so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among Israel’s able men. </span>
<span class='v R213_18' data-id='R213_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Israelites were subdued on that occasion, and the people of Judah were victorious because they relied on the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_19' data-id='R213_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Abijah pursued Jeroboam and took from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah and Ephron, with their surrounding villages. </span>
<span class='v R213_20' data-id='R213_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Jeroboam did not regain power during the time of Abijah. And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> struck him down and he died. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_21' data-id='R213_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But Abijah grew in strength. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R213_22' data-id='R213_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The other events of Abijah’s reign, what he did and what he said, are written in the annotations of the prophet Iddo. </span></div></div>
