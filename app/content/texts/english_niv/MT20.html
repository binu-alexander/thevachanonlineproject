<span class='v MT20_4' data-id='MT20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He told them, ‘You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ </span></span>
<span class='v MT20_5' data-id='MT20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So they went. </span></span></div>

<span class='v MT20_6' data-id='MT20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>About five in the afternoon he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?’</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_7' data-id='MT20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“ ‘Because no one has hired us,’ they answered. </span></span></div>

<span class='v MT20_10' data-id='MT20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius.</span></span>
<span class='v MT20_11' data-id='MT20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner.</span></span>
<span class='v MT20_12' data-id='MT20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>‘These who were hired last worked only one hour,’ they said, ‘and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.’ </span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_17' data-id='MT20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus was going up to Jerusalem. On the way, he took the Twelve aside and said to them, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_20' data-id='MT20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Jesus with her sons and, kneeling down, asked a favor of him. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_22' data-id='MT20_22'>“We can,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_23' data-id='MT20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_24' data-id='MT20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When the ten heard about this, they were indignant with the two brothers. </span>
<span class='v MT20_25' data-id='MT20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus called them together and said, <span class='wj'>“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.</span></span>
<span class='v MT20_26' data-id='MT20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, </span></span>
<span class='v MT20_27' data-id='MT20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and whoever wants to be first must be your slave—</span></span>
<span class='v MT20_28' data-id='MT20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Two Blind Men Receive Sight </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_29' data-id='MT20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>As Jesus and his disciples were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT20_30' data-id='MT20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was going by, they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!” </span></div>
