<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL3_5' data-id='CL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. </span>
<span class='v CL3_6' data-id='CL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because of these, the wrath of God is coming.<span class='note' id='footnote-3107'><a href='#note-3107' class='key'>†</a></span></span>

<span class='v CL3_12' data-id='CL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. </span>

<span class='v CL3_14' data-id='CL3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. </span></div>

<span class='v CL3_15' data-id='CL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. </span>
<span class='v CL3_16' data-id='CL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. </span>
<span class='v CL3_17' data-id='CL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. </span></div>
