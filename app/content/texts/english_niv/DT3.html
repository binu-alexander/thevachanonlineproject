<div class='s'>Defeat of Og King of Bashan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_1' data-id='DT3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Next we turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at Edrei. </span>
<span class='v DT3_2' data-id='DT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_3' data-id='DT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God also gave into our hands Og king of Bashan and all his army. We struck them down, leaving no survivors. </span>
<span class='v DT3_4' data-id='DT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>At that time we took all his cities. There was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them—the whole region of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. </span>
<span class='v DT3_5' data-id='DT3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>All these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars, and there were also a great many unwalled villages. </span>
<span class='v DT3_6' data-id='DT3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We completely destroyed<span class='note' id='footnote-508'><a href='#note-508' class='key'>*</a></span> them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, destroying<span class='note' id='footnote-509'><a href='#note-509' class='key'>†</a></span> every city—men, women and children. </span>
<span class='v DT3_7' data-id='DT3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_8' data-id='DT3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So at that time we took from these two kings of the Amorites the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge as far as Mount Hermon. </span>
<span class='v DT3_9' data-id='DT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians; the Amorites call it Senir.) </span>
<span class='v DT3_10' data-id='DT3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>We took all the towns on the plateau, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, towns of Og’s kingdom in Bashan. </span>
<span class='v DT3_11' data-id='DT3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaites. His bed was decorated with iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide.<span class='note' id='footnote-510'><a href='#note-510' class='key'>‡</a></span> It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.) </span></div>
<div class='s'>Division of the Land </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_12' data-id='DT3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Of the land that we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge, including half the hill country of Gilead, together with its towns. </span>
<span class='v DT3_13' data-id='DT3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan used to be known as a land of the Rephaites. </span>
<span class='v DT3_14' data-id='DT3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maakathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.<span class='note' id='footnote-511'><a href='#note-511' class='key'>§</a></span>) </span>
<span class='v DT3_15' data-id='DT3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And I gave Gilead to Makir. </span>
<span class='v DT3_16' data-id='DT3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory extending from Gilead down to the Arnon Gorge (the middle of the gorge being the border) and out to the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites. </span>
<span class='v DT3_17' data-id='DT3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_18' data-id='DT3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I commanded you at that time: “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has given you this land to take possession of it. But all your able-bodied men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of the other Israelites. </span>
<span class='v DT3_19' data-id='DT3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>However, your wives, your children and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the towns I have given you, </span>
<span class='v DT3_20' data-id='DT3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>until the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken over the land that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving them across the Jordan. After that, each of you may go back to the possession I have given you.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Moses Forbidden to Cross the Jordan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_21' data-id='DT3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that time I commanded Joshua: “You have seen with your own eyes all that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has done to these two kings. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going. </span>
<span class='v DT3_22' data-id='DT3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Do not be afraid of them; the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God himself will fight for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_23' data-id='DT3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>At that time I pleaded with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span>
<span class='v DT3_24' data-id='DT3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do? </span>
<span class='v DT3_25' data-id='DT3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Let me go over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT3_26' data-id='DT3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But because of you the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was angry with me and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter. </span>
<span class='v DT3_27' data-id='DT3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west and north and south and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan. </span>
<span class='v DT3_28' data-id='DT3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But commission Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see.” </span>
<span class='v DT3_29' data-id='DT3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So we stayed in the valley near Beth Peor. </span></div></div>
