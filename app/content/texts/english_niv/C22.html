<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_1' data-id='C22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So I made up my mind that I would not make another painful visit to you. </span>
<span class='v C22_2' data-id='C22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For if I grieve you, who is left to make me glad but you whom I have grieved? </span>
<span class='v C22_3' data-id='C22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I wrote as I did, so that when I came I would not be distressed by those who should have made me rejoice. I had confidence in all of you, that you would all share my joy. </span>
<span class='v C22_4' data-id='C22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For I wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Forgiveness for the Offender </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_5' data-id='C22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If anyone has caused grief, he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent—not to put it too severely. </span>
<span class='v C22_6' data-id='C22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. </span>
<span class='v C22_7' data-id='C22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. </span>
<span class='v C22_8' data-id='C22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him. </span>
<span class='v C22_9' data-id='C22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Another reason I wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything. </span>
<span class='v C22_10' data-id='C22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Anyone you forgive, I also forgive. And what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I have forgiven in the sight of Christ for your sake, </span>
<span class='v C22_11' data-id='C22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>in order that Satan might not outwit us. For we are not unaware of his schemes. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Ministers of the New Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_12' data-id='C22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the Lord had opened a door for me, </span>
<span class='v C22_13' data-id='C22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_14' data-id='C22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. </span>
<span class='v C22_15' data-id='C22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing. </span>
<span class='v C22_16' data-id='C22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other, an aroma that brings life. And who is equal to such a task? </span>
<span class='v C22_17' data-id='C22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Unlike so many, we do not peddle the word of God for profit. On the contrary, in Christ we speak before God with sincerity, as those sent from God. </span></div></div>
