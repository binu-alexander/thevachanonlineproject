<span class='v LV9_1' data-id='LV9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel. </span>
<span class='v LV9_2' data-id='LV9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf for your sin offering<span class='note' id='footnote-370'><a href='#note-370' class='key'>*</a></span> and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV9_3' data-id='LV9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then say to the Israelites: ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, a calf and a lamb—both a year old and without defect—for a burnt offering, </span>
<span class='v LV9_4' data-id='LV9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and an ox<span class='note' id='footnote-371'><a href='#note-371' class='key'>†</a></span> and a ram for a fellowship offering to sacrifice before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, together with a grain offering mixed with olive oil. For today the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will appear to you.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_5' data-id='LV9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They took the things Moses commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the entire assembly came near and stood before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV9_6' data-id='LV9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Moses said, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> may appear to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_7' data-id='LV9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and the people; sacrifice the offering that is for the people and make atonement for them, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_8' data-id='LV9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Aaron came to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. </span>
<span class='v LV9_9' data-id='LV9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>His sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood and put it on the horns of the altar; the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_10' data-id='LV9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>On the altar he burned the fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses; </span>
<span class='v LV9_11' data-id='LV9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>the flesh and the hide he burned up outside the camp. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_12' data-id='LV9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_13' data-id='LV9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They handed him the burnt offering piece by piece, including the head, and he burned them on the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_14' data-id='LV9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on top of the burnt offering on the altar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_15' data-id='LV9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Aaron then brought the offering that was for the people. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering and slaughtered it and offered it for a sin offering as he did with the first one. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_16' data-id='LV9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He brought the burnt offering and offered it in the prescribed way. </span>
<span class='v LV9_17' data-id='LV9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He also brought the grain offering, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_18' data-id='LV9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the fellowship offering for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he splashed it against the sides of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_19' data-id='LV9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But the fat portions of the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver— </span>
<span class='v LV9_20' data-id='LV9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>these they laid on the breasts, and then Aaron burned the fat on the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV9_21' data-id='LV9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as a wave offering, as Moses commanded. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_22' data-id='LV9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them. And having sacrificed the sin offering, the burnt offering and the fellowship offering, he stepped down. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV9_23' data-id='LV9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron then went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people; and the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to all the people. </span>
<span class='v LV9_24' data-id='LV9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Fire came out from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they shouted for joy and fell facedown. </span></div></div>
