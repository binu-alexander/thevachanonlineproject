<div class='s'>Appointing Elders Who Love What Is Good </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_5' data-id='TT1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The reason I left you in Crete was that you might put in order what was left unfinished and appoint<span class='note' id='footnote-3139'><a href='#note-3139' class='key'>*</a></span> elders in every town, as I directed you. </span>
<span class='v TT1_6' data-id='TT1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>An elder must be blameless, faithful to his wife, a man whose children believe<span class='note' id='footnote-3140'><a href='#note-3140' class='key'>†</a></span> and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient. </span>
<span class='v TT1_7' data-id='TT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Since an overseer manages God’s household, he must be blameless—not overbearing, not quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent, not pursuing dishonest gain. </span>
<span class='v TT1_8' data-id='TT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Rather, he must be hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. </span>
<span class='v TT1_9' data-id='TT1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v TT1_10' data-id='TT1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For there are many rebellious people, full of meaningless talk and deception, especially those of the circumcision group. </span>
<span class='v TT1_11' data-id='TT1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They must be silenced, because they are disrupting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—and that for the sake of dishonest gain. </span>
<span class='v TT1_12' data-id='TT1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>One of Crete’s own prophets has said it: “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3141'><a href='#note-3141' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v TT1_13' data-id='TT1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith </span>
<span class='v TT1_14' data-id='TT1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth. </span>
<span class='v TT1_15' data-id='TT1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted. </span>
<span class='v TT1_16' data-id='TT1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good. </span></div></div>
