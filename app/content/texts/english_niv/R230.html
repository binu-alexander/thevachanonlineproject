<span class='v R230_1' data-id='R230_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah and also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh, inviting them to come to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R230_2' data-id='R230_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The king and his officials and the whole assembly in Jerusalem decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month. </span>
<span class='v R230_3' data-id='R230_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R230_4' data-id='R230_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly. </span>
<span class='v R230_5' data-id='R230_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They decided to send a proclamation throughout Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, calling the people to come to Jerusalem and celebrate the Passover to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. It had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_6' data-id='R230_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>At the king’s command, couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with letters from the king and from his officials, which read: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_6' data-id='R230_6'>“People of Israel, return to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, that he may return to you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria. </span>
<span class='v R230_7' data-id='R230_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not be like your parents and your fellow Israelites, who were unfaithful to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, so that he made them an object of horror, as you see. </span>
<span class='v R230_8' data-id='R230_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Do not be stiff-necked, as your ancestors were; submit to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. Come to his sanctuary, which he has consecrated forever. Serve the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, so that his fierce anger will turn away from you. </span>
<span class='v R230_9' data-id='R230_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If you return to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, then your fellow Israelites and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will return to this land, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is gracious and compassionate. He will not turn his face from you if you return to him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_10' data-id='R230_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The couriers went from town to town in Ephraim and Manasseh, as far as Zebulun, but people scorned and ridiculed them. </span>
<span class='v R230_11' data-id='R230_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, some from Asher, Manasseh and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R230_12' data-id='R230_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Also in Judah the hand of God was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered, following the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_13' data-id='R230_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>A very large crowd of people assembled in Jerusalem to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month. </span>
<span class='v R230_14' data-id='R230_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They removed the altars in Jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_15' data-id='R230_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R230_16' data-id='R230_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the Law of Moses the man of God. The priests splashed against the altar the blood handed to them by the Levites. </span>
<span class='v R230_17' data-id='R230_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves, the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs<span class='note' id='footnote-1218'><a href='#note-1218' class='key'>*</a></span> to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R230_18' data-id='R230_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Although most of the many people who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover, contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, who is good, pardon everyone </span>
<span class='v R230_19' data-id='R230_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>who sets their heart on seeking God—the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors—even if they are not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary.” </span>
<span class='v R230_20' data-id='R230_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> heard Hezekiah and healed the people. </span></div>

<span class='v R230_21' data-id='R230_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great rejoicing, while the Levites and priests praised the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> every day with resounding instruments dedicated to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.<span class='note' id='footnote-1219'><a href='#note-1219' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_22' data-id='R230_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites, who showed good understanding of the service of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. For the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised<span class='note' id='footnote-1220'><a href='#note-1220' class='key'>‡</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R230_23' data-id='R230_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days; so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully. </span>
<span class='v R230_24' data-id='R230_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah king of Judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly, and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats. A great number of priests consecrated themselves. </span>
<span class='v R230_25' data-id='R230_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites and all who had assembled from Israel, including the foreigners who had come from Israel and also those who resided in Judah. </span>
<span class='v R230_26' data-id='R230_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>There was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R230_27' data-id='R230_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The priests and the Levites stood to bless the people, and God heard them, for their prayer reached heaven, his holy dwelling place. </span></div></div>
