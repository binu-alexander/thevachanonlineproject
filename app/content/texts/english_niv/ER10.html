<div class='s'>The People’s Confession of Sin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_1' data-id='ER10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and throwing himself down before the house of God, a large crowd of Israelites—men, women and children—gathered around him. They too wept bitterly. </span>
<span class='v ER10_2' data-id='ER10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Shekaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us. But in spite of this, there is still hope for Israel. </span>
<span class='v ER10_3' data-id='ER10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now let us make a covenant before our God to send away all these women and their children, in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law. </span>
<span class='v ER10_4' data-id='ER10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Rise up; this matter is in your hands. We will support you, so take courage and do it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_5' data-id='ER10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So Ezra rose up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel under oath to do what had been suggested. And they took the oath. </span>
<span class='v ER10_6' data-id='ER10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While he was there, he ate no food and drank no water, because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_7' data-id='ER10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A proclamation was then issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ER10_8' data-id='ER10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders, and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_9' data-id='ER10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. And on the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people were sitting in the square before the house of God, greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain. </span>
<span class='v ER10_10' data-id='ER10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful; you have married foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt. </span>
<span class='v ER10_11' data-id='ER10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now honor<span class='note' id='footnote-1267'><a href='#note-1267' class='key'>*</a></span> the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, and do his will. Separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_12' data-id='ER10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly responded with a loud voice: “You are right! We must do as you say. </span>
<span class='v ER10_13' data-id='ER10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; so we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two, because we have sinned greatly in this thing. </span>
<span class='v ER10_14' data-id='ER10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let our officials act for the whole assembly. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.” </span>
<span class='v ER10_15' data-id='ER10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite, opposed this. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER10_16' data-id='ER10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So the exiles did as was proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were family heads, one from each family division, and all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases, </span>
<span class='v ER10_17' data-id='ER10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women. </span></div>
