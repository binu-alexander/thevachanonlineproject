<span class='v JG10_7' data-id='JG10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>he became angry with them. He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites, </span>
<span class='v JG10_8' data-id='JG10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>who that year shattered and crushed them. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites on the east side of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites. </span>
<span class='v JG10_9' data-id='JG10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin and Ephraim; Israel was in great distress. </span>
