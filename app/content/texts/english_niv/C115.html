<div class='s'>The Resurrection of Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_1' data-id='C115_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. </span>
<span class='v C115_2' data-id='C115_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_3' data-id='C115_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance<span class='note' id='footnote-3004'><a href='#note-3004' class='key'>*</a></span>: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, </span>
<span class='v C115_4' data-id='C115_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, </span>
<span class='v C115_5' data-id='C115_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and that he appeared to Cephas,<span class='note' id='footnote-3005'><a href='#note-3005' class='key'>†</a></span> and then to the Twelve. </span>
<span class='v C115_6' data-id='C115_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. </span>
<span class='v C115_7' data-id='C115_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles, </span>
<span class='v C115_8' data-id='C115_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and last of all he appeared to me also, as to one abnormally born. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_9' data-id='C115_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For I am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. </span>
<span class='v C115_10' data-id='C115_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me. </span>
<span class='v C115_11' data-id='C115_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Whether, then, it is I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Resurrection of the Dead </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_12' data-id='C115_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But if it is preached that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? </span>
<span class='v C115_13' data-id='C115_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. </span>
<span class='v C115_14' data-id='C115_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith. </span>
<span class='v C115_15' data-id='C115_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>More than that, we are then found to be false witnesses about God, for we have testified about God that he raised Christ from the dead. But he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised. </span>
<span class='v C115_16' data-id='C115_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised either. </span>
<span class='v C115_17' data-id='C115_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. </span>
<span class='v C115_18' data-id='C115_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ are lost. </span>
<span class='v C115_19' data-id='C115_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_20' data-id='C115_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. </span>
<span class='v C115_21' data-id='C115_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. </span>
<span class='v C115_22' data-id='C115_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. </span>
<span class='v C115_23' data-id='C115_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But each in turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him. </span>
<span class='v C115_24' data-id='C115_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power. </span>
<span class='v C115_25' data-id='C115_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. </span>
<span class='v C115_26' data-id='C115_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The last enemy to be destroyed is death. </span>
<span class='v C115_27' data-id='C115_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For he “has put everything under his feet.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3006'><a href='#note-3006' class='key'>‡</a></span> Now when it says that “everything” has been put under him, it is clear that this does not include God himself, who put everything under Christ. </span>
<span class='v C115_28' data-id='C115_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_29' data-id='C115_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now if there is no resurrection, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized for them? </span>
<span class='v C115_30' data-id='C115_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And as for us, why do we endanger ourselves every hour? </span>
<span class='v C115_31' data-id='C115_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>I face death every day—yes, just as surely as I boast about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. </span>
<span class='v C115_32' data-id='C115_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with no more than human hopes, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v C115_32' data-id='C115_32'>“Let us eat and drink, </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v C115_33' data-id='C115_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3008'><a href='#note-3008' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v C115_34' data-id='C115_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Resurrection Body </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_35' data-id='C115_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” </span>
<span class='v C115_36' data-id='C115_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>How foolish! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies. </span>
<span class='v C115_37' data-id='C115_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>When you sow, you do not plant the body that will be, but just a seed, perhaps of wheat or of something else. </span>
<span class='v C115_38' data-id='C115_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body. </span>
<span class='v C115_39' data-id='C115_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Not all flesh is the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds another and fish another. </span>
<span class='v C115_40' data-id='C115_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another. </span>
<span class='v C115_41' data-id='C115_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>The sun has one kind of splendor, the moon another and the stars another; and star differs from star in splendor. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_42' data-id='C115_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; </span>
<span class='v C115_43' data-id='C115_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; </span>
<span class='v C115_44' data-id='C115_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_44' data-id='C115_44'>If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. </span>
<span class='v C115_45' data-id='C115_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>So it is written: “The first man Adam became a living being”<span class='note' id='footnote-3009'><a href='#note-3009' class='key'>†</a></span>; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit. </span>
<span class='v C115_46' data-id='C115_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual. </span>
<span class='v C115_47' data-id='C115_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The first man was of the dust of the earth; the second man is of heaven. </span>
<span class='v C115_48' data-id='C115_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>As was the earthly man, so are those who are of the earth; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven. </span>
<span class='v C115_49' data-id='C115_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And just as we have borne the image of the earthly man, so shall we<span class='note' id='footnote-3010'><a href='#note-3010' class='key'>‡</a></span> bear the image of the heavenly man. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C115_50' data-id='C115_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. </span>
<span class='v C115_51' data-id='C115_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed— </span>
<span class='v C115_52' data-id='C115_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. </span>
<span class='v C115_53' data-id='C115_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. </span>
<span class='v C115_54' data-id='C115_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3011'><a href='#note-3011' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div>
