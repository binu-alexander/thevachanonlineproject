<span class='v EK35_1' data-id='EK35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK35_2' data-id='EK35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir; prophesy against it </span>
<span class='v EK35_3' data-id='EK35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste. </span>
<span class='v EK35_4' data-id='EK35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate. Then you will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK35_5' data-id='EK35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, the time their punishment reached its climax, </span>
<span class='v EK35_6' data-id='EK35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you. </span>
<span class='v EK35_7' data-id='EK35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go. </span>
<span class='v EK35_8' data-id='EK35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines. </span>
<span class='v EK35_9' data-id='EK35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I will make you desolate forever; your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK35_10' data-id='EK35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Because you have said, “These two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them,” even though I the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was there, </span>
<span class='v EK35_11' data-id='EK35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>therefore as surely as I live, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and I will make myself known among them when I judge you. </span>
<span class='v EK35_12' data-id='EK35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then you will know that I the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of Israel. You said, “They have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour.” </span>
<span class='v EK35_13' data-id='EK35_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint, and I heard it. </span>
<span class='v EK35_14' data-id='EK35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: While the whole earth rejoices, I will make you desolate. </span>
<span class='v EK35_15' data-id='EK35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Because you rejoiced when the inheritance of Israel became desolate, that is how I will treat you. You will be desolate, Mount Seir, you and all of Edom. Then they will know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.’ ” </span></div></div>
