<span class='v J15_1' data-id='J15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well. </span>
<span class='v J15_2' data-id='J15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is how we know that we love the children of God: by loving God and carrying out his commands. </span>
<span class='v J15_3' data-id='J15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In fact, this is love for God: to keep his commands. And his commands are not burdensome, </span>
<span class='v J15_4' data-id='J15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith. </span>

<span class='v J15_9' data-id='J15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>We accept human testimony, but God’s testimony is greater because it is the testimony of God, which he has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_10' data-id='J15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in the Son of God accepts this testimony. Whoever does not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because they have not believed the testimony God has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_11' data-id='J15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. </span>

<span class='v J15_15' data-id='J15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. </span></div>
