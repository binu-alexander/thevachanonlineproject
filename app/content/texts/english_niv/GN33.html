<div class='s'>Jacob Meets Esau </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_1' data-id='GN33_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel and the two female servants. </span>
<span class='v GN33_2' data-id='GN33_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear. </span>
<span class='v GN33_3' data-id='GN33_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_4' data-id='GN33_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept. </span>
<span class='v GN33_5' data-id='GN33_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_5' data-id='GN33_5'>Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_6' data-id='GN33_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down. </span>
<span class='v GN33_7' data-id='GN33_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_8' data-id='GN33_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_8' data-id='GN33_8'>“To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_9' data-id='GN33_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_10' data-id='GN33_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably. </span>
<span class='v GN33_11' data-id='GN33_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_12' data-id='GN33_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_13' data-id='GN33_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die. </span>
<span class='v GN33_14' data-id='GN33_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_15' data-id='GN33_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_15' data-id='GN33_15'>“But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_16' data-id='GN33_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir. </span>
<span class='v GN33_17' data-id='GN33_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.<span class='note' id='footnote-150'><a href='#note-150' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN33_18' data-id='GN33_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>After Jacob came from Paddan Aram,<span class='note' id='footnote-151'><a href='#note-151' class='key'>†</a></span> he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city. </span>
<span class='v GN33_19' data-id='GN33_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For a hundred pieces of silver,<span class='note' id='footnote-152'><a href='#note-152' class='key'>‡</a></span> he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent. </span>
<span class='v GN33_20' data-id='GN33_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.<span class='note' id='footnote-153'><a href='#note-153' class='key'>§</a></span></span></div></div>
