<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_1' data-id='GL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by a man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— </span>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and all the brothers and sisters<span class='note' id='footnote-3037'><a href='#note-3037' class='key'>*</a></span> with me, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'>To the churches in Galatia: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_3' data-id='GL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v GL1_4' data-id='GL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </span>
<span class='v GL1_5' data-id='GL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>No Other Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_6' data-id='GL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you to live in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— </span>
<span class='v GL1_7' data-id='GL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>which is really no gospel at all. Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_8' data-id='GL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse! </span>
<span class='v GL1_9' data-id='GL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let them be under God’s curse! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_10' data-id='GL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Am I now trying to win the approval of human beings, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul Called by God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_11' data-id='GL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. </span>
<span class='v GL1_12' data-id='GL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_13' data-id='GL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For you have heard of my previous way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it. </span>
<span class='v GL1_14' data-id='GL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers. </span>
<span class='v GL1_15' data-id='GL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased </span>
<span class='v GL1_16' data-id='GL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being. </span>
<span class='v GL1_17' data-id='GL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_18' data-id='GL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas<span class='note' id='footnote-3038'><a href='#note-3038' class='key'>†</a></span> and stayed with him fifteen days. </span>
<span class='v GL1_19' data-id='GL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I saw none of the other apostles—only James, the Lord’s brother. </span>
<span class='v GL1_20' data-id='GL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I assure you before God that what I am writing you is no lie. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_21' data-id='GL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v GL1_22' data-id='GL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_23' data-id='GL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They only heard the report: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” </span>
<span class='v GL1_24' data-id='GL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they praised God because of me. </span></div></div>
