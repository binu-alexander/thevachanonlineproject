<div class='s'>The Angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> at Bokim </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_1' data-id='JG2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said, “I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land I swore to give to your ancestors. I said, ‘I will never break my covenant with you, </span>
<span class='v JG2_2' data-id='JG2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land, but you shall break down their altars.’ Yet you have disobeyed me. Why have you done this? </span>
<span class='v JG2_3' data-id='JG2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I have also said, ‘I will not drive them out before you; they will become traps for you, and their gods will become snares to you.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_4' data-id='JG2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had spoken these things to all the Israelites, the people wept aloud, </span>
<span class='v JG2_5' data-id='JG2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and they called that place Bokim.<span class='note' id='footnote-602'><a href='#note-602' class='key'>*</a></span> There they offered sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Disobedience and Defeat </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_6' data-id='JG2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After Joshua had dismissed the Israelites, they went to take possession of the land, each to their own inheritance. </span>
<span class='v JG2_7' data-id='JG2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The people served the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had done for Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_8' data-id='JG2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, died at the age of a hundred and ten. </span>
<span class='v JG2_9' data-id='JG2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres<span class='note' id='footnote-603'><a href='#note-603' class='key'>†</a></span> in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_10' data-id='JG2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>After that whole generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation grew up who knew neither the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> nor what he had done for Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG2_11' data-id='JG2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and served the Baals. </span>
<span class='v JG2_12' data-id='JG2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They forsook the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them. They aroused the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger </span>
<span class='v JG2_13' data-id='JG2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>because they forsook him and served Baal and the Ashtoreths. </span>
<span class='v JG2_14' data-id='JG2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In his anger against Israel the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave them into the hands of raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, whom they were no longer able to resist. </span>
<span class='v JG2_15' data-id='JG2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whenever Israel went out to fight, the hand of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was against them to defeat them, just as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_16' data-id='JG2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> raised up judges,<span class='note' id='footnote-604'><a href='#note-604' class='key'>‡</a></span> who saved them out of the hands of these raiders. </span>
<span class='v JG2_17' data-id='JG2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them. They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors, who had been obedient to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s commands. </span>
<span class='v JG2_18' data-id='JG2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Whenever the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived; for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> relented because of their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them. </span>
<span class='v JG2_19' data-id='JG2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshiping them. They refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG2_20' data-id='JG2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Therefore the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was very angry with Israel and said, “Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to me, </span>
<span class='v JG2_21' data-id='JG2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died. </span>
<span class='v JG2_22' data-id='JG2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I will use them to test Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and walk in it as their ancestors did.” </span>
<span class='v JG2_23' data-id='JG2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had allowed those nations to remain; he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of Joshua. </span></div></div>
