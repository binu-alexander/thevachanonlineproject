<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_1' data-id='GN50_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him. </span>
<span class='v GN50_2' data-id='GN50_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him, </span>
<span class='v GN50_3' data-id='GN50_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>taking a full forty days, for that was the time required for embalming. And the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_4' data-id='GN50_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favor in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, </span>
<span class='v GN50_5' data-id='GN50_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die; bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_6' data-id='GN50_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_7' data-id='GN50_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt— </span>
<span class='v GN50_8' data-id='GN50_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and their flocks and herds were left in Goshen. </span>
<span class='v GN50_9' data-id='GN50_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Chariots and horsemen<span class='note' id='footnote-222'><a href='#note-222' class='key'>*</a></span> also went up with him. It was a very large company. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_10' data-id='GN50_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; and there Joseph observed a seven-day period of mourning for his father. </span>
<span class='v GN50_11' data-id='GN50_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why that place near the Jordan is called Abel Mizraim.<span class='note' id='footnote-223'><a href='#note-223' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_12' data-id='GN50_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them: </span>
<span class='v GN50_13' data-id='GN50_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial place from Ephron the Hittite. </span>
<span class='v GN50_14' data-id='GN50_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Joseph Reassures His Brothers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_15' data-id='GN50_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?” </span>
<span class='v GN50_16' data-id='GN50_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died: </span>
<span class='v GN50_17' data-id='GN50_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.” When their message came to him, Joseph wept. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_18' data-id='GN50_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_19' data-id='GN50_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? </span>
<span class='v GN50_20' data-id='GN50_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. </span>
<span class='v GN50_21' data-id='GN50_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Joseph </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_22' data-id='GN50_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived a hundred and ten years </span>
<span class='v GN50_23' data-id='GN50_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children. Also the children of Makir son of Manasseh were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.<span class='note' id='footnote-224'><a href='#note-224' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_24' data-id='GN50_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.” </span>
<span class='v GN50_25' data-id='GN50_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN50_26' data-id='GN50_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So Joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt. </span></div></div>
