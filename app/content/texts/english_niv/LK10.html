<span class='v LK10_2' data-id='LK10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He told them, <span class='wj'>“The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_3' data-id='LK10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Go! I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</span></span>

<span class='v LK10_17' data-id='LK10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The seventy-two returned with joy and said, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_18' data-id='LK10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span></span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_21' data-id='LK10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, <span class='wj'>“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_23' data-id='LK10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, <span class='wj'>“Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_24' data-id='LK10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Good Samaritan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_25' data-id='LK10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_26' data-id='LK10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“What is written in the Law?”</span> he replied. <span class='wj'>“How do you read it?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_27' data-id='LK10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’<span class='note' id='footnote-2656'><a href='#note-2656' class='key'>‡</a></span>; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’<span class='note' id='footnote-2657'><a href='#note-2657' class='key'>§</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_28' data-id='LK10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“You have answered correctly,”</span> Jesus replied. <span class='wj'>“Do this and you will live.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_29' data-id='LK10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_30' data-id='LK10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>In reply Jesus said: <span class='wj'>“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_31' data-id='LK10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_32' data-id='LK10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_33' data-id='LK10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_34' data-id='LK10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him.</span></span>
<span class='v LK10_35' data-id='LK10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The next day he took out two denarii</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2658'><a href='#note-2658' class='key'>*</a></span><span class='wj'>and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’ </span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_36' data-id='LK10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_37' data-id='LK10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>The expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy on him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_37' data-id='LK10_37'>Jesus told him, <span class='wj'>“Go and do likewise.”</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_38' data-id='LK10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him. </span>
<span class='v LK10_39' data-id='LK10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to what he said. </span>
<span class='v LK10_40' data-id='LK10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK10_41' data-id='LK10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Martha, Martha,”</span> the Lord answered, <span class='wj'>“you are worried and upset about many things, </span></span>
