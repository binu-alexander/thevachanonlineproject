<span class='v C23_2' data-id='C23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. </span>
<span class='v C23_3' data-id='C23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You show that you are a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. </span></div>

<span class='v C23_4' data-id='C23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Such confidence we have through Christ before God. </span>
<span class='v C23_5' data-id='C23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. </span>
<span class='v C23_6' data-id='C23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </span></div>

<span class='v C23_7' data-id='C23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory, so that the Israelites could not look steadily at the face of Moses because of its glory, transitory though it was, </span>
<span class='v C23_8' data-id='C23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? </span>
<span class='v C23_9' data-id='C23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If the ministry that brought condemnation was glorious, how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness! </span>
<span class='v C23_10' data-id='C23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory. </span>
<span class='v C23_11' data-id='C23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And if what was transitory came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts! </span></div>

<span class='v C23_14' data-id='C23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. </span>
<span class='v C23_15' data-id='C23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts. </span>
<span class='v C23_16' data-id='C23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But whenever anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. </span>
