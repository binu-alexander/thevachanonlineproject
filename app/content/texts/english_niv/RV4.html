<span class='v RV4_1' data-id='RV4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I looked, and there before me was a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, <span class='wj'>“Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.”</span></span>
<span class='v RV4_2' data-id='RV4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>At once I was in the Spirit, and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it. </span>
<span class='v RV4_3' data-id='RV4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and ruby. A rainbow that shone like an emerald encircled the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV4_4' data-id='RV4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and seated on them were twenty-four elders. They were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads. </span>
<span class='v RV4_5' data-id='RV4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were blazing. These are the seven spirits<span class='note' id='footnote-3276'><a href='#note-3276' class='key'>*</a></span> of God. </span>
<span class='v RV4_6' data-id='RV4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Also in front of the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass, clear as crystal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV4_6' data-id='RV4_6'>In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, and they were covered with eyes, in front and in back. </span>
<span class='v RV4_7' data-id='RV4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like an ox, the third had a face like a man, the fourth was like a flying eagle. </span>
<span class='v RV4_8' data-id='RV4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying: </span></div>
<div class='qc'>“ ‘Holy, holy, holy </div>
<div class='qc'>is the Lord God Almighty,’<span class='note' id='footnote-3277'><a href='#note-3277' class='key'>†</a></span></div>

<span class='v RV4_9' data-id='RV4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever, </span>
<span class='v RV4_10' data-id='RV4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say: </span></div>
