<span class='v K214_2' data-id='K214_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan; she was from Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K214_3' data-id='K214_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He did what was right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but not as his father David had done. In everything he followed the example of his father Joash. </span>
<span class='v K214_4' data-id='K214_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The high places, however, were not removed; the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there. </span></div>

<span class='v K214_5' data-id='K214_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>After the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king. </span>
<span class='v K214_6' data-id='K214_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Yet he did not put the children of the assassins to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses where the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded: “Parents are not to be put to death for their children, nor children put to death for their parents; each will die for their own sin.”<span class='note' id='footnote-960'><a href='#note-960' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K214_8' data-id='K214_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, with the challenge: “Come, let us face each other in battle.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K214_9' data-id='K214_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But Jehoash king of Israel replied to Amaziah king of Judah: “A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon, ‘Give your daughter to my son in marriage.’ Then a wild beast in Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot. </span>
<span class='v K214_10' data-id='K214_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You have indeed defeated Edom and now you are arrogant. Glory in your victory, but stay at home! Why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of Judah also?” </span></div>

<span class='v K214_11' data-id='K214_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Amaziah, however, would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel attacked. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other at Beth Shemesh in Judah. </span>
