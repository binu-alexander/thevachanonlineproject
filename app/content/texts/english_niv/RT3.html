<div class='s'>Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_1' data-id='RT3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One day Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home<span class='note' id='footnote-667'><a href='#note-667' class='key'>*</a></span> for you, where you will be well provided for. </span>
<span class='v RT3_2' data-id='RT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now Boaz, with whose women you have worked, is a relative of ours. Tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor. </span>
<span class='v RT3_3' data-id='RT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Wash, put on perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. </span>
<span class='v RT3_4' data-id='RT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When he lies down, note the place where he is lying. Then go and uncover his feet and lie down. He will tell you what to do.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_5' data-id='RT3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“I will do whatever you say,” Ruth answered. </span>
<span class='v RT3_6' data-id='RT3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_7' data-id='RT3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile. Ruth approached quietly, uncovered his feet and lay down. </span>
<span class='v RT3_8' data-id='RT3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the middle of the night something startled the man; he turned—and there was a woman lying at his feet! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_9' data-id='RT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Who are you?” he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_9' data-id='RT3_9'>“I am your servant Ruth,” she said. “Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are a guardian-redeemer<span class='note' id='footnote-668'><a href='#note-668' class='key'>†</a></span> of our family.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_10' data-id='RT3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bless you, my daughter,” he replied. “This kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier: You have not run after the younger men, whether rich or poor. </span>
<span class='v RT3_11' data-id='RT3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do for you all you ask. All the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character. </span>
<span class='v RT3_12' data-id='RT3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Although it is true that I am a guardian-redeemer of our family, there is another who is more closely related than I. </span>
<span class='v RT3_13' data-id='RT3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Stay here for the night, and in the morning if he wants to do his duty as your guardian-redeemer, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> lives I will do it. Lie here until morning.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_14' data-id='RT3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So she lay at his feet until morning, but got up before anyone could be recognized; and he said, “No one must know that a woman came to the threshing floor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_15' data-id='RT3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He also said, “Bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she did so, he poured into it six measures of barley and placed the bundle on her. Then he<span class='note' id='footnote-669'><a href='#note-669' class='key'>‡</a></span> went back to town. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_16' data-id='RT3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When Ruth came to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_16' data-id='RT3_16'>Then she told her everything Boaz had done for her </span>
<span class='v RT3_17' data-id='RT3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Don’t go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RT3_18' data-id='RT3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you find out what happens. For the man will not rest until the matter is settled today.” </span></div></div>
