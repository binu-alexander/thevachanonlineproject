<span class='v JR42_2' data-id='JR42_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Jeremiah the prophet and said to him, “Please hear our petition and pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once many, now only a few are left. </span>
<span class='v JR42_3' data-id='JR42_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Pray that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will tell us where we should go and what we should do.” </span></div>

<span class='v JR42_4' data-id='JR42_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“I have heard you,” replied Jeremiah the prophet. “I will certainly pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God as you have requested; I will tell you everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says and will keep nothing back from you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR42_5' data-id='JR42_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God sends you to tell us. </span>
<span class='v JR42_6' data-id='JR42_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Whether it is favorable or unfavorable, we will obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it will go well with us, for we will obey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God.” </span></div>

<span class='v JR42_7' data-id='JR42_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Ten days later the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to Jeremiah. </span>
<span class='v JR42_8' data-id='JR42_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So he called together Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest. </span>
<span class='v JR42_9' data-id='JR42_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your petition, says: </span>
<span class='v JR42_10' data-id='JR42_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>‘If you stay in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have inflicted on you. </span>
<span class='v JR42_11' data-id='JR42_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for I am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands. </span>

<span class='v JR42_13' data-id='JR42_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“However, if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ and so disobey the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, </span>

<span class='v JR42_15' data-id='JR42_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>then hear the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, you remnant of Judah. This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and you do go to settle there, </span>
<span class='v JR42_16' data-id='JR42_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>then the sword you fear will overtake you there, and the famine you dread will follow you into Egypt, and there you will die. </span>
<span class='v JR42_17' data-id='JR42_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Indeed, all who are determined to go to Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, famine and plague; not one of them will survive or escape the disaster I will bring on them.’ </span>
<span class='v JR42_18' data-id='JR42_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. You will be a curse<span class='note' id='footnote-2003'><a href='#note-2003' class='key'>†</a></span> and an object of horror, a curse<span class='note' id='footnote-2004'><a href='#note-2004' class='key'>‡</a></span> and an object of reproach; you will never see this place again.’ </span></div>

<span class='v JR42_19' data-id='JR42_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Remnant of Judah, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has told you, ‘Do not go to Egypt.’ Be sure of this: I warn you today </span>
<span class='v JR42_20' data-id='JR42_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and said, ‘Pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God for us; tell us everything he says and we will do it.’ </span>
<span class='v JR42_21' data-id='JR42_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I have told you today, but you still have not obeyed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God in all he sent me to tell you. </span>
