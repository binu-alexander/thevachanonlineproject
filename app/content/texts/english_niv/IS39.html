<span class='v IS39_2' data-id='IS39_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armory and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them. </span></div>

<span class='v IS39_3' data-id='IS39_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did those men say, and where did they come from?” </span></div>

<span class='v IS39_6' data-id='IS39_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The time will surely come when everything in your palace, and all that your predecessors have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v IS39_7' data-id='IS39_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.” </span></div>
