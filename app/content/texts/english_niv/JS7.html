<div class='s'>Achan’s Sin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_1' data-id='JS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But the Israelites were unfaithful in regard to the devoted things<span class='note' id='footnote-565'><a href='#note-565' class='key'>*</a></span>; Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri,<span class='note' id='footnote-566'><a href='#note-566' class='key'>†</a></span> the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of them. So the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_2' data-id='JS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the region.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_3' data-id='JS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the army will have to go up against Ai. Send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary the whole army, for only a few people live there.” </span>
<span class='v JS7_4' data-id='JS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So about three thousand went up; but they were routed by the men of Ai, </span>
<span class='v JS7_5' data-id='JS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>who killed about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted in fear and became like water. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_6' data-id='JS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, remaining there till evening. The elders of Israel did the same, and sprinkled dust on their heads. </span>
<span class='v JS7_7' data-id='JS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, why did you ever bring this people across the Jordan to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan! </span>
<span class='v JS7_8' data-id='JS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Pardon your servant, Lord. What can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies? </span>
<span class='v JS7_9' data-id='JS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The Canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your own great name?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_10' data-id='JS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Joshua, “Stand up! What are you doing down on your face? </span>
<span class='v JS7_11' data-id='JS7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, they have put them with their own possessions. </span>
<span class='v JS7_12' data-id='JS7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_13' data-id='JS7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow; for this is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: There are devoted things among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_14' data-id='JS7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“ ‘In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> chooses shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> chooses shall come forward family by family; and the family the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> chooses shall come forward man by man. </span>
<span class='v JS7_15' data-id='JS7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that belongs to him. He has violated the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and has done an outrageous thing in Israel!’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_16' data-id='JS7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and Judah was chosen. </span>
<span class='v JS7_17' data-id='JS7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were chosen. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward by families, and Zimri was chosen. </span>
<span class='v JS7_18' data-id='JS7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Joshua had his family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Karmi, the son of Zimri, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_19' data-id='JS7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, and honor him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_20' data-id='JS7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel. This is what I have done: </span>
<span class='v JS7_21' data-id='JS7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When I saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia,<span class='note' id='footnote-567'><a href='#note-567' class='key'>‡</a></span> two hundred shekels<span class='note' id='footnote-568'><a href='#note-568' class='key'>§</a></span> of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels,<span class='note' id='footnote-569'><a href='#note-569' class='key'>*</a></span> I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_22' data-id='JS7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent, and there it was, hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. </span>
<span class='v JS7_23' data-id='JS7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites and spread them out before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_24' data-id='JS7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys and sheep, his tent and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor. </span>
<span class='v JS7_25' data-id='JS7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Joshua said, “Why have you brought this trouble on us? The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will bring trouble on you today.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS7_25' data-id='JS7_25'>Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them. </span>
<span class='v JS7_26' data-id='JS7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks, which remains to this day. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> turned from his fierce anger. Therefore that place has been called the Valley of Achor<span class='note' id='footnote-570'><a href='#note-570' class='key'>†</a></span> ever since. </span></div></div>
