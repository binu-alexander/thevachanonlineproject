<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_1' data-id='C111_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>On Covering the Head in Worship </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_2' data-id='C111_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I passed them on to you. </span>
<span class='v C111_3' data-id='C111_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man,<span class='note' id='footnote-2987'><a href='#note-2987' class='key'>*</a></span> and the head of Christ is God. </span>
<span class='v C111_4' data-id='C111_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. </span>
<span class='v C111_5' data-id='C111_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. </span>
<span class='v C111_6' data-id='C111_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_7' data-id='C111_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A man ought not to cover his head,<span class='note' id='footnote-2988'><a href='#note-2988' class='key'>†</a></span> since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. </span>
<span class='v C111_8' data-id='C111_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; </span>
<span class='v C111_9' data-id='C111_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. </span>
<span class='v C111_10' data-id='C111_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own<span class='note' id='footnote-2989'><a href='#note-2989' class='key'>‡</a></span> head, because of the angels. </span>
<span class='v C111_11' data-id='C111_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. </span>
<span class='v C111_12' data-id='C111_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_13' data-id='C111_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? </span>
<span class='v C111_14' data-id='C111_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, </span>
<span class='v C111_15' data-id='C111_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. </span>
<span class='v C111_16' data-id='C111_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice—nor do the churches of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Correcting an Abuse of the Lord’s Supper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_17' data-id='C111_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good. </span>
<span class='v C111_18' data-id='C111_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. </span>
<span class='v C111_19' data-id='C111_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s approval. </span>
<span class='v C111_20' data-id='C111_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat, </span>
<span class='v C111_21' data-id='C111_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk. </span>
<span class='v C111_22' data-id='C111_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? Certainly not in this matter! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_23' data-id='C111_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took bread, </span>
<span class='v C111_24' data-id='C111_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, <span class='wj'>“This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.”</span></span>
<span class='v C111_25' data-id='C111_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, <span class='wj'>“This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span></span>
<span class='v C111_26' data-id='C111_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_27' data-id='C111_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C111_28' data-id='C111_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink from the cup. </span>
<span class='v C111_29' data-id='C111_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. </span>
<span class='v C111_30' data-id='C111_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. </span>
<span class='v C111_31' data-id='C111_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment. </span>
<span class='v C111_32' data-id='C111_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_33' data-id='C111_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat together. </span>
<span class='v C111_34' data-id='C111_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_34' data-id='C111_34'>And when I come I will give further directions. </span></div></div>
