<div class='s'>Paul and the False Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_1' data-id='C211_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I hope you will put up with me in a little foolishness. Yes, please put up with me! </span>
<span class='v C211_2' data-id='C211_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so that I might present you as a pure virgin to him. </span>
<span class='v C211_3' data-id='C211_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. </span>
<span class='v C211_4' data-id='C211_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_5' data-id='C211_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I do not think I am in the least inferior to those “super-apostles.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3034'><a href='#note-3034' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v C211_6' data-id='C211_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I may indeed be untrained as a speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have made this perfectly clear to you in every way. </span>
<span class='v C211_7' data-id='C211_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God to you free of charge? </span>
<span class='v C211_8' data-id='C211_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you. </span>
<span class='v C211_9' data-id='C211_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. </span>
<span class='v C211_10' data-id='C211_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, nobody in the regions of Achaia will stop this boasting of mine. </span>
<span class='v C211_11' data-id='C211_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_12' data-id='C211_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. </span>
<span class='v C211_13' data-id='C211_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ. </span>
<span class='v C211_14' data-id='C211_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. </span>
<span class='v C211_15' data-id='C211_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what their actions deserve. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_16' data-id='C211_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I repeat: Let no one take me for a fool. But if you do, then tolerate me just as you would a fool, so that I may do a little boasting. </span>
<span class='v C211_17' data-id='C211_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In this self-confident boasting I am not talking as the Lord would, but as a fool. </span>
<span class='v C211_18' data-id='C211_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Since many are boasting in the way the world does, I too will boast. </span>
<span class='v C211_19' data-id='C211_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You gladly put up with fools since you are so wise! </span>
<span class='v C211_20' data-id='C211_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In fact, you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or puts on airs or slaps you in the face. </span>
<span class='v C211_21' data-id='C211_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To my shame I admit that we were too weak for that! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_21' data-id='C211_21'>Whatever anyone else dares to boast about—I am speaking as a fool—I also dare to boast about. </span>
<span class='v C211_22' data-id='C211_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I. </span>
<span class='v C211_23' data-id='C211_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Are they servants of Christ? (I am out of my mind to talk like this.) I am more. I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. </span>
<span class='v C211_24' data-id='C211_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. </span>
<span class='v C211_25' data-id='C211_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, </span>
<span class='v C211_26' data-id='C211_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers. </span>
<span class='v C211_27' data-id='C211_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. </span>
<span class='v C211_28' data-id='C211_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. </span>
<span class='v C211_29' data-id='C211_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C211_30' data-id='C211_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness. </span>
<span class='v C211_31' data-id='C211_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be praised forever, knows that I am not lying. </span>
<span class='v C211_32' data-id='C211_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. </span>
<span class='v C211_33' data-id='C211_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands. </span></div></div>
