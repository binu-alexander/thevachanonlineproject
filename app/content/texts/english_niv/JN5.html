<div class='s'>The Healing at the Pool </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_1' data-id='JN5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Some time later, Jesus went up to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish festivals. </span>
<span class='v JN5_2' data-id='JN5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda<span class='note' id='footnote-2723'><a href='#note-2723' class='key'>*</a></span> and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. </span>
<span class='v JN5_3' data-id='JN5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Here a great number of disabled people used to lie—the blind, the lame, the paralyzed.<span class='note' id='footnote-2724'><a href='#note-2724' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v JN5_5' data-id='JN5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>One who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. </span>
<span class='v JN5_6' data-id='JN5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time, he asked him, <span class='wj'>“Do you want to get well?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_7' data-id='JN5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Sir,” the invalid replied, “I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else goes down ahead of me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_8' data-id='JN5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Get up! Pick up your mat and walk.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_9' data-id='JN5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>At once the man was cured; he picked up his mat and walked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_9' data-id='JN5_9'>The day on which this took place was a Sabbath, </span>
<span class='v JN5_10' data-id='JN5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; the law forbids you to carry your mat.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_11' data-id='JN5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But he replied, “The man who made me well said to me, <span class='wj'>‘Pick up your mat and walk.’ </span> ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_12' data-id='JN5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So they asked him, “Who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_13' data-id='JN5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The man who was healed had no idea who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_14' data-id='JN5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Later Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, <span class='wj'>“See, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_15' data-id='JN5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The man went away and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Authority of the Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_16' data-id='JN5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. </span>
<span class='v JN5_17' data-id='JN5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In his defense Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_18' data-id='JN5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For this reason they tried all the more to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_19' data-id='JN5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus gave them this answer: <span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_20' data-id='JN5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_21' data-id='JN5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_22' data-id='JN5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, </span></span>
<span class='v JN5_23' data-id='JN5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_24' data-id='JN5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Very truly I tell you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_25' data-id='JN5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Very truly I tell you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_26' data-id='JN5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_27' data-id='JN5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And he has given him authority to judge because he is the Son of Man.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_28' data-id='JN5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_29' data-id='JN5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>and come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.</span></span>
<span class='v JN5_30' data-id='JN5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.</span></span></div>

<span class='v JN5_31' data-id='JN5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</span></span>
