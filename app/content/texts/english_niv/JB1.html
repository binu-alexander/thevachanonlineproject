<div class='s'>Prologue </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_1' data-id='JB1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the land of Uz there lived a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright; he feared God and shunned evil. </span>
<span class='v JB1_2' data-id='JB1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He had seven sons and three daughters, </span>
<span class='v JB1_3' data-id='JB1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys, and had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_4' data-id='JB1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>His sons used to hold feasts in their homes on their birthdays, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. </span>
<span class='v JB1_5' data-id='JB1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When a period of feasting had run its course, Job would make arrangements for them to be purified. Early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular custom. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_6' data-id='JB1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>One day the angels<span class='note' id='footnote-1317'><a href='#note-1317' class='key'>*</a></span> came to present themselves before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and Satan<span class='note' id='footnote-1318'><a href='#note-1318' class='key'>†</a></span> also came with them. </span>
<span class='v JB1_7' data-id='JB1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_7' data-id='JB1_7'>Satan answered the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_8' data-id='JB1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_9' data-id='JB1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. </span>
<span class='v JB1_10' data-id='JB1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. </span>
<span class='v JB1_11' data-id='JB1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_12' data-id='JB1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_12' data-id='JB1_12'>Then Satan went out from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_13' data-id='JB1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>One day when Job’s sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, </span>
<span class='v JB1_14' data-id='JB1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, </span>
<span class='v JB1_15' data-id='JB1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and the Sabeans attacked and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_16' data-id='JB1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The fire of God fell from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_17' data-id='JB1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and made off with them. They put the servants to the sword, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_18' data-id='JB1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brother’s house, </span>
<span class='v JB1_19' data-id='JB1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on them and they are dead, and I am the only one who has escaped to tell you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_20' data-id='JB1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>At this, Job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground in worship </span>
<span class='v JB1_21' data-id='JB1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB1_21' data-id='JB1_21'>“Naked I came from my mother’s womb, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB1_21' data-id='JB1_21'>and naked I will depart.<span class='note' id='footnote-1319'><a href='#note-1319' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB1_21' data-id='JB1_21'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has taken away; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB1_21' data-id='JB1_21'>may the name of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> be praised.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB1_22' data-id='JB1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In all this, Job did not sin by charging God with wrongdoing. </span></div></div>
