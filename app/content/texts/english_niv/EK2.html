<div class='s'>Ezekiel’s Call to Be a Prophet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK2_1' data-id='EK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “Son of man,<span class='note' id='footnote-2051'><a href='#note-2051' class='key'>*</a></span> stand up on your feet and I will speak to you.” </span>
<span class='v EK2_2' data-id='EK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As he spoke, the Spirit came into me and raised me to my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK2_3' data-id='EK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He said: “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have been in revolt against me to this very day. </span>
<span class='v EK2_4' data-id='EK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and stubborn. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says.’ </span>
<span class='v EK2_5' data-id='EK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And whether they listen or fail to listen—for they are a rebellious people—they will know that a prophet has been among them. </span>
<span class='v EK2_6' data-id='EK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not be afraid, though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions. Do not be afraid of what they say or be terrified by them, though they are a rebellious people. </span>
<span class='v EK2_7' data-id='EK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You must speak my words to them, whether they listen or fail to listen, for they are rebellious. </span>
<span class='v EK2_8' data-id='EK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But you, son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not rebel like that rebellious people; open your mouth and eat what I give you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK2_9' data-id='EK2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, </span>
<span class='v EK2_10' data-id='EK2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe. </span></div></div>

<span class='footnote' id='note-2051'><span class='key'>* </span><a href='#footnote-2051' class='backref'>2:1</a> <span class='text'><span class="ft"> The Hebrew phrase </span><span class="fqa">ben adam </span><span class="ft"> means </span><span class="fqa">human being</span><span class="ft">. The phrase </span><span class="fqa">son of man </span><span class="ft"> is retained as a form of address here and throughout Ezekiel because of its possible association with “Son of Man” in the New Testament.</span></span></span>
