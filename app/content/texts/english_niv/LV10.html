<div class='s'>The Death of Nadab and Abihu </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_1' data-id='LV10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu took their censers, put fire in them and added incense; and they offered unauthorized fire before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, contrary to his command. </span>
<span class='v LV10_2' data-id='LV10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So fire came out from the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and consumed them, and they died before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Moses then said to Aaron, “This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> spoke of when he said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'>“ ‘Among those who approach me </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'>I will be proved holy; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'>in the sight of all the people </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'>I will be honored.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LV10_3' data-id='LV10_3'>Aaron remained silent. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_4' data-id='LV10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here; carry your cousins outside the camp, away from the front of the sanctuary.” </span>
<span class='v LV10_5' data-id='LV10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So they came and carried them, still in their tunics, outside the camp, as Moses ordered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_6' data-id='LV10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt<span class='note' id='footnote-372'><a href='#note-372' class='key'>*</a></span> and do not tear your clothes, or you will die and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will be angry with the whole community. But your relatives, all the Israelites, may mourn for those the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has destroyed by fire. </span>
<span class='v LV10_7' data-id='LV10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anointing oil is on you.” So they did as Moses said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_8' data-id='LV10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Aaron, </span>
<span class='v LV10_9' data-id='LV10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, </span>
<span class='v LV10_10' data-id='LV10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean, </span>
<span class='v LV10_11' data-id='LV10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has given them through Moses.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_12' data-id='LV10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering left over from the food offerings prepared without yeast and presented to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and eat it beside the altar, for it is most holy. </span>
<span class='v LV10_13' data-id='LV10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is your share and your sons’ share of the food offerings presented to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; for so I have been commanded. </span>
<span class='v LV10_14' data-id='LV10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented. Eat them in a ceremonially clean place; they have been given to you and your children as your share of the Israelites’ fellowship offerings. </span>
<span class='v LV10_15' data-id='LV10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The thigh that was presented and the breast that was waved must be brought with the fat portions of the food offerings, to be waved before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> as a wave offering. This will be the perpetual share for you and your children, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_16' data-id='LV10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When Moses inquired about the goat of the sin offering<span class='note' id='footnote-373'><a href='#note-373' class='key'>†</a></span> and found that it had been burned up, he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and asked, </span>
<span class='v LV10_17' data-id='LV10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy; it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v LV10_18' data-id='LV10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Since its blood was not taken into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV10_19' data-id='LV10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but such things as this have happened to me. Would the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> have been pleased if I had eaten the sin offering today?” </span>
<span class='v LV10_20' data-id='LV10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When Moses heard this, he was satisfied. </span></div></div>
