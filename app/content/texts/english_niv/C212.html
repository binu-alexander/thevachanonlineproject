<div class='p'>
<span class='v C212_1' data-id='C212_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I must go on boasting. Although there is nothing to be gained, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C212_2' data-id='C212_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. </span>
<span class='v C212_3' data-id='C212_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows— </span>
<span class='v C212_4' data-id='C212_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>was caught up to paradise and heard inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. </span>
<span class='v C212_5' data-id='C212_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will boast about a man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my weaknesses. </span>
<span class='v C212_6' data-id='C212_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what I do or say, </span>
<span class='v C212_7' data-id='C212_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>or because of these surpassingly great revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. </span>
<span class='v C212_8' data-id='C212_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. </span>
<span class='v C212_9' data-id='C212_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But he said to me, <span class='wj'>“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. </span>
<span class='v C212_10' data-id='C212_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul’s Concern for the Corinthians </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C212_11' data-id='C212_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I have made a fool of myself, but you drove me to it. I ought to have been commended by you, for I am not in the least inferior to the “super-apostles,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3035'><a href='#note-3035' class='key'>*</a></span> even though I am nothing. </span>
<span class='v C212_12' data-id='C212_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I persevered in demonstrating among you the marks of a true apostle, including signs, wonders and miracles. </span>
<span class='v C212_13' data-id='C212_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C212_14' data-id='C212_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you, because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to save up for their parents, but parents for their children. </span>
<span class='v C212_15' data-id='C212_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less? </span>
<span class='v C212_16' data-id='C212_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by trickery! </span>
<span class='v C212_17' data-id='C212_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to you? </span>
<span class='v C212_18' data-id='C212_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C212_19' data-id='C212_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? We have been speaking in the sight of God as those in Christ; and everything we do, dear friends, is for your strengthening. </span>
<span class='v C212_20' data-id='C212_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I am afraid that when I come I may not find you as I want you to be, and you may not find me as you want me to be. I fear that there may be discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, arrogance and disorder. </span>
<span class='v C212_21' data-id='C212_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I am afraid that when I come again my God will humble me before you, and I will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged. </span></div></div>
