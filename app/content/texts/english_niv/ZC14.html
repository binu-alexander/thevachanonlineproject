<div class='c'>14</div>
<div class='s'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Comes and Reigns </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_1' data-id='ZC14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A day of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is coming, Jerusalem, when your possessions will be plundered and divided up within your very walls. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_2' data-id='ZC14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to fight against it; the city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the women raped. Half of the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_3' data-id='ZC14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will go out and fight against those nations, as he fights on a day of battle. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_4' data-id='ZC14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a great valley, with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_5' data-id='ZC14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You will flee by my mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake<span class='note' id='footnote-2427'><a href='#note-2427' class='key'>*</a></span> in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_6' data-id='ZC14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On that day there will be neither sunlight nor cold, frosty darkness. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_7' data-id='ZC14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It will be a unique day—a day known only to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>—with no distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_8' data-id='ZC14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem, half of it east to the Dead Sea and half of it west to the Mediterranean Sea, in summer and in winter. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_9' data-id='ZC14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will be king over the whole earth. On that day there will be one <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and his name the only name. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_10' data-id='ZC14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The whole land, from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become like the Arabah. But Jerusalem will be raised up high from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the royal winepresses, and will remain in its place. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_11' data-id='ZC14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It will be inhabited; never again will it be destroyed. Jerusalem will be secure. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_12' data-id='ZC14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>This is the plague with which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will strike all the nations that fought against Jerusalem: Their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_13' data-id='ZC14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>On that day people will be stricken by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with great panic. They will seize each other by the hand and attack one another. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_14' data-id='ZC14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Judah too will fight at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected—great quantities of gold and silver and clothing. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_15' data-id='ZC14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>A similar plague will strike the horses and mules, the camels and donkeys, and all the animals in those camps. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC14_16' data-id='ZC14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_17' data-id='ZC14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, they will have no rain. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_18' data-id='ZC14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If the Egyptian people do not go up and take part, they will have no rain. The <span class='nd'>Lord</span><span class='note' id='footnote-2428'><a href='#note-2428' class='key'>†</a></span> will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_19' data-id='ZC14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles. </span></div>

<span class='v ZC14_20' data-id='ZC14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>On that day <span class='sc'>holy to the Lord</span> will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar. </span>
<span class='v ZC14_21' data-id='ZC14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them.
