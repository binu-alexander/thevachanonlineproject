<span class='v RV19_1' data-id='RV19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting: </span></div>

<span class='v RV19_3' data-id='RV19_3'>“Hallelujah! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_3' data-id='RV19_3'>The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_4' data-id='RV19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, who was seated on the throne. And they cried: </span></div>

<span class='v RV19_10' data-id='RV19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>At this I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Don’t do that!

<span class='v RV19_11' data-id='RV19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True. With justice he judges and wages war. </span>
<span class='v RV19_12' data-id='RV19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. </span>
<span class='v RV19_13' data-id='RV19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. </span>
<span class='v RV19_14' data-id='RV19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen, white and clean. </span>
<span class='v RV19_15' data-id='RV19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Coming out of his mouth is a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. “He will rule them with an iron scepter.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3309'><a href='#note-3309' class='key'>*</a></span> He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty. </span>
<span class='v RV19_16' data-id='RV19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: </span></div>
<div class='pc'>
<span class='v RV19_16' data-id='RV19_16'>king of kings and lord of lords. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_17' data-id='RV19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, </span>
<span class='v RV19_18' data-id='RV19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>so that you may eat the flesh of kings, generals, and the mighty, of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, great and small.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_19' data-id='RV19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army. </span>
<span class='v RV19_20' data-id='RV19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs on its behalf.

<span class='v RV19_21' data-id='RV19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh. </span></div></div>
