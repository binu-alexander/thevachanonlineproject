<div class='s'>Favoritism Forbidden </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_1' data-id='JM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism. </span>
<span class='v JM2_2' data-id='JM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in filthy old clothes also comes in. </span>
<span class='v JM2_3' data-id='JM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but say to the poor man, “You stand there” or “Sit on the floor by my feet,” </span>
<span class='v JM2_4' data-id='JM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_5' data-id='JM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him? </span>
<span class='v JM2_6' data-id='JM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? </span>
<span class='v JM2_7' data-id='JM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of him to whom you belong? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_8' data-id='JM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3210'><a href='#note-3210' class='key'>*</a></span> you are doing right. </span>
<span class='v JM2_9' data-id='JM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. </span>
<span class='v JM2_10' data-id='JM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. </span>
<span class='v JM2_11' data-id='JM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he who said, “You shall not commit adultery,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3211'><a href='#note-3211' class='key'>†</a></span> also said, “You shall not murder.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3212'><a href='#note-3212' class='key'>‡</a></span> If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_12' data-id='JM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom, </span>
<span class='v JM2_13' data-id='JM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Faith and Deeds </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_14' data-id='JM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? </span>
<span class='v JM2_15' data-id='JM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. </span>
<span class='v JM2_16' data-id='JM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? </span>
<span class='v JM2_17' data-id='JM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_18' data-id='JM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_18' data-id='JM2_18'>Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. </span>
<span class='v JM2_19' data-id='JM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_20' data-id='JM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless<span class='note' id='footnote-3213'><a href='#note-3213' class='key'>§</a></span>? </span>
<span class='v JM2_21' data-id='JM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? </span>
<span class='v JM2_22' data-id='JM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. </span>
<span class='v JM2_23' data-id='JM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,”<span class='note' id='footnote-3214'><a href='#note-3214' class='key'>*</a></span> and he was called God’s friend. </span>
<span class='v JM2_24' data-id='JM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_25' data-id='JM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? </span>
<span class='v JM2_26' data-id='JM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead. </span></div></div>
