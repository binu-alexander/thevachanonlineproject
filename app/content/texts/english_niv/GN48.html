<div class='s'>Manasseh and Ephraim </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_1' data-id='GN48_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Some time later Joseph was told, “Your father is ill.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim along with him. </span>
<span class='v GN48_2' data-id='GN48_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_3' data-id='GN48_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty<span class='note' id='footnote-199'><a href='#note-199' class='key'>*</a></span> appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and there he blessed me </span>
<span class='v GN48_4' data-id='GN48_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to me, ‘I am going to make you fruitful and increase your numbers. I will make you a community of peoples, and I will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_5' data-id='GN48_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Now then, your two sons born to you in Egypt before I came to you here will be reckoned as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh will be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. </span>
<span class='v GN48_6' data-id='GN48_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Any children born to you after them will be yours; in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers. </span>
<span class='v GN48_7' data-id='GN48_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As I was returning from Paddan,<span class='note' id='footnote-200'><a href='#note-200' class='key'>†</a></span> to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan while we were still on the way, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem). </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_8' data-id='GN48_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he asked, “Who are these?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_9' data-id='GN48_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“They are the sons God has given me here,” Joseph said to his father. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_9' data-id='GN48_9'>Then Israel said, “Bring them to me so I may bless them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_10' data-id='GN48_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_11' data-id='GN48_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_12' data-id='GN48_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground. </span>
<span class='v GN48_13' data-id='GN48_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him. </span>
<span class='v GN48_14' data-id='GN48_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Israel reached out his right hand and put it on Ephraim’s head, though he was the younger, and crossing his arms, he put his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then he blessed Joseph and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>“May the God before whom my fathers </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>Abraham and Isaac walked faithfully, </span></div>

<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>the God who has been my shepherd </span></div>

<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>all my life to this day, </span></div>

<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>the Angel who has delivered me from all harm </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>—may he bless these boys. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>May they be called by my name </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>and may they increase greatly </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>on the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_17' data-id='GN48_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head he was displeased; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. </span>
<span class='v GN48_18' data-id='GN48_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to him, “No, my father, this one is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_19' data-id='GN48_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will become great. Nevertheless, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a group of nations.” </span>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He blessed them that day and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>“In your<span class='note' id='footnote-201'><a href='#note-201' class='key'>‡</a></span> name will Israel pronounce this blessing: </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>So he put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_21' data-id='GN48_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you<span class='note' id='footnote-202'><a href='#note-202' class='key'>§</a></span> and take you<span class='note' id='footnote-203'><a href='#note-203' class='key'>*</a></span> back to the land of your<span class='note' id='footnote-204'><a href='#note-204' class='key'>†</a></span> fathers. </span>
