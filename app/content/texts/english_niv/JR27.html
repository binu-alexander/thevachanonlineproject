<span class='v JR27_2' data-id='JR27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me: “Make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck. </span>
<span class='v JR27_3' data-id='JR27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon through the envoys who have come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR27_4' data-id='JR27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Give them a message for their masters and say, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Tell this to your masters: </span>
<span class='v JR27_5' data-id='JR27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>With my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it, and I give it to anyone I please. </span>
<span class='v JR27_6' data-id='JR27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now I will give all your countries into the hands of my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; I will make even the wild animals subject to him. </span>
<span class='v JR27_7' data-id='JR27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>All nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes; then many nations and great kings will subjugate him. </span></div>

<span class='v JR27_8' data-id='JR27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“ ‘ “If, however, any nation or kingdom will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon or bow its neck under his yoke, I will punish that nation with the sword, famine and plague, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, until I destroy it by his hand. </span>
<span class='v JR27_9' data-id='JR27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your interpreters of dreams, your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’ </span>
<span class='v JR27_10' data-id='JR27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands; I will banish you and you will perish. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR27_12' data-id='JR27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Bow your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people, and you will live. </span>
<span class='v JR27_13' data-id='JR27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Why will you and your people die by the sword, famine and plague with which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? </span>
<span class='v JR27_14' data-id='JR27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, ‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying lies to you. </span>
