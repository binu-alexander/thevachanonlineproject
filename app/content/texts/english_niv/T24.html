<div class='s'>A Final Charge to Timothy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_1' data-id='T24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I give you this charge: </span>
<span class='v T24_2' data-id='T24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction. </span>
<span class='v T24_3' data-id='T24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. </span>
<span class='v T24_4' data-id='T24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. </span>
<span class='v T24_5' data-id='T24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_6' data-id='T24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time for my departure is near. </span>
<span class='v T24_7' data-id='T24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. </span>
<span class='v T24_8' data-id='T24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for his appearing. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Personal Remarks </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_9' data-id='T24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do your best to come to me quickly, </span>
<span class='v T24_10' data-id='T24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for Demas, because he loved this world, has deserted me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. </span>
<span class='v T24_11' data-id='T24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is helpful to me in my ministry. </span>
<span class='v T24_12' data-id='T24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. </span>
<span class='v T24_13' data-id='T24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_14' data-id='T24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will repay him for what he has done. </span>
<span class='v T24_15' data-id='T24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You too should be on your guard against him, because he strongly opposed our message. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_16' data-id='T24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At my first defense, no one came to my support, but everyone deserted me. May it not be held against them. </span>
<span class='v T24_17' data-id='T24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord stood at my side and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. And I was delivered from the lion’s mouth. </span>
<span class='v T24_18' data-id='T24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
