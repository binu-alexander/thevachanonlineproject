<div class='s'>John the Baptist Beheaded </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_1' data-id='MT14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus, </span>
<span class='v MT14_2' data-id='MT14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he said to his attendants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_3' data-id='MT14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, </span>
<span class='v MT14_4' data-id='MT14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_5' data-id='MT14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they considered John a prophet. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_6' data-id='MT14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On Herod’s birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the guests and pleased Herod so much </span>
<span class='v MT14_7' data-id='MT14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. </span>
<span class='v MT14_8' data-id='MT14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_9' data-id='MT14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request be granted </span>
<span class='v MT14_10' data-id='MT14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and had John beheaded in the prison. </span>
<span class='v MT14_11' data-id='MT14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>His head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MT14_12' data-id='MT14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_13' data-id='MT14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard what had happened, he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. Hearing of this, the crowds followed him on foot from the towns. </span>
<span class='v MT14_14' data-id='MT14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and healed their sick. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_15' data-id='MT14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As evening approached, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_16' data-id='MT14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus replied, <span class='wj'>“They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_17' data-id='MT14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_18' data-id='MT14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Bring them here to me,”</span> he said. </span>
<span class='v MT14_19' data-id='MT14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people. </span>
<span class='v MT14_20' data-id='MT14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over. </span>
<span class='v MT14_21' data-id='MT14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The number of those who ate was about five thousand men, besides women and children. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Walks on the Water </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_22' data-id='MT14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. </span>
<span class='v MT14_23' data-id='MT14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, </span>
<span class='v MT14_24' data-id='MT14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_25' data-id='MT14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. </span>
<span class='v MT14_26' data-id='MT14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_27' data-id='MT14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Jesus immediately said to them: <span class='wj'>“Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_28' data-id='MT14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Come,”</span> he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'>Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT14_30' data-id='MT14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_31' data-id='MT14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. <span class='wj'>“You of little faith,”</span> he said, <span class='wj'>“why did you doubt?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_32' data-id='MT14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. </span>
<span class='v MT14_33' data-id='MT14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_34' data-id='MT14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret. </span>
<span class='v MT14_35' data-id='MT14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding country. People brought all their sick to him </span>
<span class='v MT14_36' data-id='MT14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed. </span></div></div>
