<div class='s'>The New Stone Tablets </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX34_1' data-id='EX34_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. </span>
<span class='v EX34_2' data-id='EX34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Be ready in the morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Present yourself to me there on top of the mountain. </span>
<span class='v EX34_3' data-id='EX34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX34_4' data-id='EX34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded him; and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands. </span>
<span class='v EX34_5' data-id='EX34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v EX34_6' data-id='EX34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness, </span>
<span class='v EX34_7' data-id='EX34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX34_8' data-id='EX34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped. </span>
<span class='v EX34_9' data-id='EX34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Lord,” he said, “if I have found favor in your eyes, then let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.” </span></div>
