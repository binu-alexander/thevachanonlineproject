<div class='s'>Job </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_1' data-id='JB42_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Job replied to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_2' data-id='JB42_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“I know that you can do all things; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_2' data-id='JB42_2'>no purpose of yours can be thwarted. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'>Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'>things too wonderful for me to know. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'>I will question you, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'>and you shall answer me.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_5' data-id='JB42_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My ears had heard of you </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_5' data-id='JB42_5'>but now my eyes have seen you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_6' data-id='JB42_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore I despise myself </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_6' data-id='JB42_6'>and repent in dust and ashes.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Epilogue </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_7' data-id='JB42_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “I am angry with you and your two friends, because you have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has. </span>
<span class='v JB42_8' data-id='JB42_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly. You have not spoken the truth about me, as my servant Job has.” </span>
<span class='v JB42_9' data-id='JB42_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite did what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> told them; and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> accepted Job’s prayer. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_10' data-id='JB42_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>After Job had prayed for his friends, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> restored his fortunes and gave him twice as much as he had before. </span>
<span class='v JB42_11' data-id='JB42_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>All his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house. They comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had brought on him, and each one gave him a piece of silver<span class='note' id='footnote-1394'><a href='#note-1394' class='key'>*</a></span> and a gold ring. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_12' data-id='JB42_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> blessed the latter part of Job’s life more than the former part. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys. </span>
<span class='v JB42_13' data-id='JB42_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he also had seven sons and three daughters. </span>
<span class='v JB42_14' data-id='JB42_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The first daughter he named Jemimah, the second Keziah and the third Keren-Happuch. </span>
<span class='v JB42_15' data-id='JB42_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as Job’s daughters, and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_16' data-id='JB42_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>After this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. </span>
<span class='v JB42_17' data-id='JB42_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And so Job died, an old man and full of years. </span></div></div>
