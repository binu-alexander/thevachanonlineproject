<div class='s'>Division of the Rest of the Land </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS18_1' data-id='JS18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The country was brought under their control, </span>
<span class='v JS18_2' data-id='JS18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but there were still seven Israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS18_3' data-id='JS18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Joshua said to the Israelites: “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of your ancestors, has given you? </span>
<span class='v JS18_4' data-id='JS18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me. </span>
<span class='v JS18_5' data-id='JS18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You are to divide the land into seven parts. Judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the tribes of Joseph in their territory on the north. </span>
<span class='v JS18_6' data-id='JS18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land, bring them here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God. </span>
<span class='v JS18_7' data-id='JS18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The Levites, however, do not get a portion among you, because the priestly service of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan. Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave it to them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS18_8' data-id='JS18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span>
<span class='v JS18_9' data-id='JS18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So the men left and went through the land. They wrote its description on a scroll, town by town, in seven parts, and returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. </span>
<span class='v JS18_10' data-id='JS18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions. </span></div>

<span class='v JS18_11' data-id='JS18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The first lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph: </span></div>

<span class='v JS18_13' data-id='JS18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>From there it crossed to the south slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon. </span></div>

<span class='v JS18_14' data-id='JS18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south the boundary turned south along the western side and came out at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah.

<span class='v JS18_15' data-id='JS18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The southern side began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim on the west, and the boundary came out at the spring of the waters of Nephtoah. </span>
<span class='v JS18_16' data-id='JS18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The boundary went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim.

<span class='v JS18_17' data-id='JS18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, which faces the Pass of Adummim, and ran down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. </span>
<span class='v JS18_18' data-id='JS18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah<span class='note' id='footnote-587'><a href='#note-587' class='key'>*</a></span> and on down into the Arabah. </span>
<span class='v JS18_19' data-id='JS18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>It then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS18_20' data-id='JS18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. </span></div>
