<div class='s'>A Prophet Without Honor </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_1' data-id='MK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MK6_2' data-id='MK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_2' data-id='MK6_2'>“Where did this man get these things?” they asked. “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing? </span>
<span class='v MK6_3' data-id='MK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph,<span class='note' id='footnote-2564'><a href='#note-2564' class='key'>*</a></span> Judas and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_4' data-id='MK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, <span class='wj'>“A prophet is not without honor except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK6_5' data-id='MK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. </span>
<span class='v MK6_6' data-id='MK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He was amazed at their lack of faith. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v MK6_6' data-id='MK6_6'>Jesus Sends Out the Twelve </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_6' data-id='MK6_6'>Then Jesus went around teaching from village to village. </span>
<span class='v MK6_7' data-id='MK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Calling the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_8' data-id='MK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>These were his instructions: <span class='wj'>“Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts.</span></span>
<span class='v MK6_9' data-id='MK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Wear sandals but not an extra shirt.</span></span>
<span class='v MK6_10' data-id='MK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that town.</span></span>
<span class='v MK6_11' data-id='MK6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_12' data-id='MK6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They went out and preached that people should repent. </span>
<span class='v MK6_13' data-id='MK6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>John the Baptist Beheaded </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_14' data-id='MK6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>King Herod heard about this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying,<span class='note' id='footnote-2565'><a href='#note-2565' class='key'>†</a></span> “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_15' data-id='MK6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Others said, “He is Elijah.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_15' data-id='MK6_15'>And still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of long ago.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_16' data-id='MK6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised from the dead!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_17' data-id='MK6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married. </span>
<span class='v MK6_18' data-id='MK6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_19' data-id='MK6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Herodias nursed a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she was not able to, </span>
<span class='v MK6_20' data-id='MK6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard John, he was greatly puzzled<span class='note' id='footnote-2566'><a href='#note-2566' class='key'>‡</a></span>; yet he liked to listen to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_21' data-id='MK6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Finally the opportune time came. On his birthday Herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MK6_22' data-id='MK6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When the daughter of<span class='note' id='footnote-2567'><a href='#note-2567' class='key'>§</a></span> Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_22' data-id='MK6_22'>The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I’ll give it to you.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_23' data-id='MK6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he promised her with an oath, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_24' data-id='MK6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>She went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_24' data-id='MK6_24'>“The head of John the Baptist,” she answered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_25' data-id='MK6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At once the girl hurried in to the king with the request: “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_26' data-id='MK6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The king was greatly distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he did not want to refuse her. </span>
<span class='v MK6_27' data-id='MK6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s head. The man went, beheaded John in the prison, </span>
<span class='v MK6_28' data-id='MK6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and brought back his head on a platter. He presented it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MK6_29' data-id='MK6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>On hearing of this, John’s disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_30' data-id='MK6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The apostles gathered around Jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught. </span>
<span class='v MK6_31' data-id='MK6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat, he said to them, <span class='wj'>“Come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_32' data-id='MK6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place. </span>
<span class='v MK6_33' data-id='MK6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. </span>
<span class='v MK6_34' data-id='MK6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_35' data-id='MK6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him. “This is a remote place,” they said, “and it’s already very late. </span>
<span class='v MK6_36' data-id='MK6_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Send the people away so that they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_37' data-id='MK6_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But he answered, <span class='wj'>“You give them something to eat.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_37' data-id='MK6_37'>They said to him, “That would take more than half a year’s wages<span class='note' id='footnote-2568'><a href='#note-2568' class='key'>*</a></span>! Are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_38' data-id='MK6_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“How many loaves do you have?”</span> he asked. <span class='wj'>“Go and see.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_38' data-id='MK6_38'>When they found out, they said, “Five—and two fish.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_39' data-id='MK6_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. </span>
<span class='v MK6_40' data-id='MK6_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. </span>
<span class='v MK6_41' data-id='MK6_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. Then he gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. </span>
<span class='v MK6_42' data-id='MK6_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They all ate and were satisfied, </span>
<span class='v MK6_43' data-id='MK6_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish. </span>
<span class='v MK6_44' data-id='MK6_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>The number of the men who had eaten was five thousand. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Walks on the Water </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_45' data-id='MK6_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. </span>
<span class='v MK6_46' data-id='MK6_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>After leaving them, he went up on a mountainside to pray. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_47' data-id='MK6_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Later that night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land. </span>
<span class='v MK6_48' data-id='MK6_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>He saw the disciples straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the lake. He was about to pass by them, </span>
<span class='v MK6_49' data-id='MK6_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>but when they saw him walking on the lake, they thought he was a ghost. They cried out, </span>
<span class='v MK6_50' data-id='MK6_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>because they all saw him and were terrified. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_50' data-id='MK6_50'>Immediately he spoke to them and said, <span class='wj'>“Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span></span>
<span class='v MK6_51' data-id='MK6_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind died down. They were completely amazed, </span>
<span class='v MK6_52' data-id='MK6_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>for they had not understood about the loaves; their hearts were hardened. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_53' data-id='MK6_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret and anchored there. </span>
<span class='v MK6_54' data-id='MK6_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>As soon as they got out of the boat, people recognized Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MK6_55' data-id='MK6_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>They ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was. </span>
<span class='v MK6_56' data-id='MK6_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And wherever he went—into villages, towns or countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed. </span></div></div>
