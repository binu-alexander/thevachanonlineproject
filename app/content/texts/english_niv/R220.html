<span class='v R220_1' data-id='R220_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, the Moabites and Ammonites with some of the Meunites<span class='note' id='footnote-1180'><a href='#note-1180' class='key'>*</a></span> came to wage war against Jehoshaphat. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_2' data-id='R220_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some people came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast army is coming against you from Edom,<span class='note' id='footnote-1181'><a href='#note-1181' class='key'>†</a></span> from the other side of the Dead Sea. It is already in Hazezon Tamar” (that is, En Gedi). </span>
<span class='v R220_3' data-id='R220_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Alarmed, Jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and he proclaimed a fast for all Judah. </span>
<span class='v R220_4' data-id='R220_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The people of Judah came together to seek help from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>; indeed, they came from every town in Judah to seek him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_5' data-id='R220_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem at the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> in the front of the new courtyard </span>
<span class='v R220_6' data-id='R220_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and said: </span></div>

<span class='v R220_6' data-id='R220_6'>“<span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of our ancestors, are you not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in your hand, and no one can withstand you. </span>
<span class='v R220_7' data-id='R220_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham your friend? </span>

<span class='v R220_10' data-id='R220_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“But now here are men from Ammon, Moab and Mount Seir, whose territory you would not allow Israel to invade when they came from Egypt; so they turned away from them and did not destroy them. </span>

<span class='v R220_12' data-id='R220_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Our God, will you not judge them? For we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on you.” </span></div>

<span class='v R220_13' data-id='R220_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>All the men of Judah, with their wives and children and little ones, stood there before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v R220_14' data-id='R220_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the Spirit of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came on Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite and descendant of Asaph, as he stood in the assembly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_15' data-id='R220_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He said: “Listen, King Jehoshaphat and all who live in Judah and Jerusalem!

<span class='v R220_16' data-id='R220_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Tomorrow march down against them. They will be climbing up by the Pass of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the Desert of Jeruel. </span>
<span class='v R220_17' data-id='R220_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You will not have to fight this battle.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_18' data-id='R220_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem fell down in worship before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R220_19' data-id='R220_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then some Levites from the Kohathites and Korahites stood up and praised the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_20' data-id='R220_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Early in the morning they left for the Desert of Tekoa. As they set out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Have faith in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and you will be upheld; have faith in his prophets and you will be successful.” </span>
<span class='v R220_21' data-id='R220_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>After consulting the people, Jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and to praise him for the splendor of his<span class='note' id='footnote-1182'><a href='#note-1182' class='key'>‡</a></span> holiness as they went out at the head of the army, saying: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v R220_21' data-id='R220_21'>“Give thanks to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_22' data-id='R220_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>As they began to sing and praise, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated. </span>
<span class='v R220_23' data-id='R220_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_24' data-id='R220_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. </span>
<span class='v R220_25' data-id='R220_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So Jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder, and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing<span class='note' id='footnote-1183'><a href='#note-1183' class='key'>§</a></span> and also articles of value—more than they could take away. There was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it. </span>
<span class='v R220_26' data-id='R220_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berakah, where they praised the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_27' data-id='R220_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then, led by Jehoshaphat, all the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned joyfully to Jerusalem, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies. </span>
<span class='v R220_28' data-id='R220_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They entered Jerusalem and went to the temple of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> with harps and lyres and trumpets. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_29' data-id='R220_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The fear of God came on all the surrounding kingdoms when they heard how the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had fought against the enemies of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R220_30' data-id='R220_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The End of Jehoshaphat’s Reign </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R220_31' data-id='R220_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. </span>
<span class='v R220_32' data-id='R220_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He followed the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v R220_33' data-id='R220_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The high places, however, were not removed, and the people still had not set their hearts on the God of their ancestors. </span></div>
