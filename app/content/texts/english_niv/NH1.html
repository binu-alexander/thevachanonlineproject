<span class='v NH1_1' data-id='NH1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The words of Nehemiah son of Hakaliah: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH1_1' data-id='NH1_1'>In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, </span>
<span class='v NH1_2' data-id='NH1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Hanani, one of my brothers, came from Judah with some other men, and I questioned them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH1_3' data-id='NH1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They said to me, “Those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH1_4' data-id='NH1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When I heard these things, I sat down and wept. For some days I mourned and fasted and prayed before the God of heaven. </span>
<span class='v NH1_5' data-id='NH1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH1_5' data-id='NH1_5'>“<span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and keep his commandments, </span>
<span class='v NH1_6' data-id='NH1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father’s family, have committed against you. </span>
<span class='v NH1_7' data-id='NH1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>We have acted very wickedly toward you. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH1_8' data-id='NH1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, </span>
<span class='v NH1_9' data-id='NH1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.’ </span></div>

<span class='v NH1_10' data-id='NH1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. </span>
