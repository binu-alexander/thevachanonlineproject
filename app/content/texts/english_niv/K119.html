<div class='s'>Elijah Flees to Horeb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_1' data-id='K119_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. </span>
<span class='v K119_2' data-id='K119_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_3' data-id='K119_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Elijah was afraid<span class='note' id='footnote-914'><a href='#note-914' class='key'>*</a></span> and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, </span>
<span class='v K119_4' data-id='K119_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.” </span>
<span class='v K119_5' data-id='K119_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_5' data-id='K119_5'>All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” </span>
<span class='v K119_6' data-id='K119_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_7' data-id='K119_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The angel of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.” </span>
<span class='v K119_8' data-id='K119_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. </span>
<span class='v K119_9' data-id='K119_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There he went into a cave and spent the night. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v K119_9' data-id='K119_9'>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Appears to Elijah </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_9' data-id='K119_9'>And the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to him: “What are you doing here, Elijah?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_10' data-id='K119_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He replied, “I have been very zealous for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_11' data-id='K119_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is about to pass by.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_11' data-id='K119_11'>Then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not in the earthquake. </span>
<span class='v K119_12' data-id='K119_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After the earthquake came a fire, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not in the fire. And after the fire came a gentle whisper. </span>
<span class='v K119_13' data-id='K119_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Elijah heard it, he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_13' data-id='K119_13'>Then a voice said to him, “What are you doing here, Elijah?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_14' data-id='K119_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He replied, “I have been very zealous for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> God Almighty. The Israelites have rejected your covenant, torn down your altars, and put your prophets to death with the sword. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me too.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_15' data-id='K119_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to him, “Go back the way you came, and go to the Desert of Damascus. When you get there, anoint Hazael king over Aram. </span>
<span class='v K119_16' data-id='K119_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Also, anoint Jehu son of Nimshi king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to succeed you as prophet. </span>
<span class='v K119_17' data-id='K119_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of Hazael, and Elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of Jehu. </span>
<span class='v K119_18' data-id='K119_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Yet I reserve seven thousand in Israel—all whose knees have not bowed down to Baal and whose mouths have not kissed him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Call of Elisha </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_19' data-id='K119_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Elijah went from there and found Elisha son of Shaphat. He was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen, and he himself was driving the twelfth pair. Elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him. </span>
<span class='v K119_20' data-id='K119_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Elisha then left his oxen and ran after Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and mother goodbye,” he said, “and then I will come with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_20' data-id='K119_20'>“Go back,” Elijah replied. “What have I done to you?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K119_21' data-id='K119_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So Elisha left him and went back. He took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them. He burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he set out to follow Elijah and became his servant. </span></div></div>
