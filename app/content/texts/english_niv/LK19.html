<span class='v LK19_2' data-id='LK19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy. </span>
<span class='v LK19_3' data-id='LK19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He wanted to see who Jesus was, but because he was short he could not see over the crowd. </span>
<span class='v LK19_4' data-id='LK19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK19_5' data-id='LK19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, <span class='wj'>“Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today.”</span></span>
<span class='v LK19_6' data-id='LK19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK19_7' data-id='LK19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>All the people saw this and began to mutter, “He has gone to be the guest of a sinner.” </span></div>

<span class='v LK19_8' data-id='LK19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK19_9' data-id='LK19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, <span class='wj'>“Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham.</span></span>
