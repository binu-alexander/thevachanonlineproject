<span class='v P13_1' data-id='P13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, </span>
<span class='v P13_2' data-id='P13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>when they see the purity and reverence of your lives. </span>
<span class='v P13_3' data-id='P13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. </span>
<span class='v P13_4' data-id='P13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight. </span>
<span class='v P13_5' data-id='P13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in God used to adorn themselves. They submitted themselves to their own husbands, </span>
<span class='v P13_6' data-id='P13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>like Sarah, who obeyed Abraham and called him her lord. You are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_7' data-id='P13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Suffering for Doing Good </div>

<span class='v P13_8' data-id='P13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally, all of you, be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble. </span>
<span class='v P13_9' data-id='P13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing. </span>

<span class='v P13_14' data-id='P13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But even if you should suffer for what is right, you are blessed. “Do not fear their threats<span class='note' id='footnote-3230'><a href='#note-3230' class='key'>†</a></span>; do not be frightened.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3231'><a href='#note-3231' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v P13_15' data-id='P13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, </span>
<span class='v P13_16' data-id='P13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander. </span>
<span class='v P13_17' data-id='P13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For it is better, if it is God’s will, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. </span>
<span class='v P13_18' data-id='P13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the Spirit. </span>

<span class='v P13_21' data-id='P13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God.<span class='note' id='footnote-3233'><a href='#note-3233' class='key'>*</a></span> It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v P13_22' data-id='P13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>who has gone into heaven and is at God’s right hand—with angels, authorities and powers in submission to him. </span></div></div>
