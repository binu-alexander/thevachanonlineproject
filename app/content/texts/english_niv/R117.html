<span class='v R117_1' data-id='R117_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After David was settled in his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Here I am, living in a house of cedar, while the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is under a tent.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R117_2' data-id='R117_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Nathan replied to David, “Whatever you have in mind, do it, for God is with you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R117_3' data-id='R117_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: </span></div>

<span class='v R117_4' data-id='R117_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: You are not the one to build me a house to dwell in. </span>
<span class='v R117_5' data-id='R117_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I have not dwelt in a house from the day I brought Israel up out of Egypt to this day. I have moved from one tent site to another, from one dwelling place to another. </span>
<span class='v R117_6' data-id='R117_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Wherever I have moved with all the Israelites, did I ever say to any of their leaders<span class='note' id='footnote-1089'><a href='#note-1089' class='key'>*</a></span> whom I commanded to shepherd my people, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?” ’ </span></div>

<span class='v R117_7' data-id='R117_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Now then, tell my servant David, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty says: I took you from the pasture, from tending the flock, and appointed you ruler over my people Israel. </span>

<span class='v R117_11' data-id='R117_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When your days are over and you go to be with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. </span>
<span class='v R117_12' data-id='R117_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He is the one who will build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever. </span>
