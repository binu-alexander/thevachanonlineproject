<div class='s'>The Man of Lawlessness </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H22_1' data-id='H22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, </span>
<span class='v H22_2' data-id='H22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us—whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter—asserting that the day of the Lord has already come. </span>
<span class='v H22_3' data-id='H22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness<span class='note' id='footnote-3121'><a href='#note-3121' class='key'>*</a></span> is revealed, the man doomed to destruction. </span>
<span class='v H22_4' data-id='H22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God’s temple, proclaiming himself to be God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H22_5' data-id='H22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Don’t you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things? </span>
<span class='v H22_6' data-id='H22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time. </span>
<span class='v H22_7' data-id='H22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way. </span>
<span class='v H22_8' data-id='H22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming. </span>
<span class='v H22_9' data-id='H22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie, </span>
<span class='v H22_10' data-id='H22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. </span>
<span class='v H22_11' data-id='H22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie </span>
<span class='v H22_12' data-id='H22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness. </span></div>

<span class='v H22_13' data-id='H22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits<span class='note' id='footnote-3122'><a href='#note-3122' class='key'>†</a></span> to be saved through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth. </span>
<span class='v H22_14' data-id='H22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
