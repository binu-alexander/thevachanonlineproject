<div class='s'>The Silver Trumpets </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_1' data-id='NU10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses: </span>
<span class='v NU10_2' data-id='NU10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Make two trumpets of hammered silver, and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out. </span>
<span class='v NU10_3' data-id='NU10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When both are sounded, the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v NU10_4' data-id='NU10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If only one is sounded, the leaders—the heads of the clans of Israel—are to assemble before you. </span>
<span class='v NU10_5' data-id='NU10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When a trumpet blast is sounded, the tribes camping on the east are to set out. </span>
<span class='v NU10_6' data-id='NU10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>At the sounding of a second blast, the camps on the south are to set out. The blast will be the signal for setting out. </span>
<span class='v NU10_7' data-id='NU10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the signal for setting out. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_8' data-id='NU10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“The sons of Aaron, the priests, are to blow the trumpets. This is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come. </span>
<span class='v NU10_9' data-id='NU10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you, sound a blast on the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God and rescued from your enemies. </span>
<span class='v NU10_10' data-id='NU10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Also at your times of rejoicing—your appointed festivals and New Moon feasts—you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they will be a memorial for you before your God. I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Israelites Leave Sinai </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_11' data-id='NU10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>On the twentieth day of the second month of the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law. </span>
<span class='v NU10_12' data-id='NU10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran. </span>
<span class='v NU10_13' data-id='NU10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They set out, this first time, at the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s command through Moses. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_14' data-id='NU10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The divisions of the camp of Judah went first, under their standard. Nahshon son of Amminadab was in command. </span>
<span class='v NU10_15' data-id='NU10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Nethanel son of Zuar was over the division of the tribe of Issachar, </span>
<span class='v NU10_16' data-id='NU10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun. </span>
<span class='v NU10_17' data-id='NU10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites, who carried it, set out. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_18' data-id='NU10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The divisions of the camp of Reuben went next, under their standard. Elizur son of Shedeur was in command. </span>
<span class='v NU10_19' data-id='NU10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of Simeon, </span>
<span class='v NU10_20' data-id='NU10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and Eliasaph son of Deuel was over the division of the tribe of Gad. </span>
<span class='v NU10_21' data-id='NU10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things. The tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_22' data-id='NU10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The divisions of the camp of Ephraim went next, under their standard. Elishama son of Ammihud was in command. </span>
<span class='v NU10_23' data-id='NU10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh, </span>
<span class='v NU10_24' data-id='NU10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_25' data-id='NU10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Finally, as the rear guard for all the units, the divisions of the camp of Dan set out under their standard. Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai was in command. </span>
<span class='v NU10_26' data-id='NU10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Pagiel son of Okran was over the division of the tribe of Asher, </span>
<span class='v NU10_27' data-id='NU10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali. </span>
<span class='v NU10_28' data-id='NU10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_29' data-id='NU10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place about which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us and we will treat you well, for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has promised good things to Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_30' data-id='NU10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He answered, “No, I will not go; I am going back to my own land and my own people.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_31' data-id='NU10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But Moses said, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. </span>
<span class='v NU10_32' data-id='NU10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gives us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_33' data-id='NU10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So they set out from the mountain of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and traveled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest. </span>
<span class='v NU10_34' data-id='NU10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The cloud of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was over them by day when they set out from the camp. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_35' data-id='NU10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU10_36' data-id='NU10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Whenever it came to rest, he said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU10_36' data-id='NU10_36'>“Return, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU10_36' data-id='NU10_36'>to the countless thousands of Israel.” </span></div></div>
