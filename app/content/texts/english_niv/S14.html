<span class='v S14_1' data-id='S14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Samuel’s word came to all Israel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v S14_1' data-id='S14_1'>The Philistines Capture the Ark </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_1' data-id='S14_1'>Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines at Aphek. </span>
<span class='v S14_2' data-id='S14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield. </span>
<span class='v S14_3' data-id='S14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When the soldiers returned to camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bring defeat on us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant from Shiloh, so that he may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_4' data-id='S14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_5' data-id='S14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook. </span>
<span class='v S14_6' data-id='S14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Hearing the uproar, the Philistines asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_6' data-id='S14_6'>When they learned that the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had come into the camp, </span>
<span class='v S14_7' data-id='S14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>the Philistines were afraid. “A god has<span class='note' id='footnote-686'><a href='#note-686' class='key'>*</a></span> come into the camp,” they said. “Oh no! Nothing like this has happened before. </span>
<span class='v S14_8' data-id='S14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>We’re doomed! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? They are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v S14_9' data-id='S14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be strong, Philistines! Be men, or you will be subject to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Be men, and fight!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_10' data-id='S14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So the Philistines fought, and the Israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great; Israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers. </span>
<span class='v S14_11' data-id='S14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Death of Eli </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_12' data-id='S14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>That same day a Benjamite ran from the battle line and went to Shiloh with his clothes torn and dust on his head. </span>
<span class='v S14_13' data-id='S14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road, watching, because his heart feared for the ark of God. When the man entered the town and told what had happened, the whole town sent up a cry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_14' data-id='S14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this uproar?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_14' data-id='S14_14'>The man hurried over to Eli, </span>
<span class='v S14_15' data-id='S14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>who was ninety-eight years old and whose eyes had failed so that he could not see. </span>
<span class='v S14_16' data-id='S14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He told Eli, “I have just come from the battle line; I fled from it this very day.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_16' data-id='S14_16'>Eli asked, “What happened, my son?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_17' data-id='S14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The man who brought the news replied, “Israel fled before the Philistines, and the army has suffered heavy losses. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_18' data-id='S14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and he was heavy. He had led<span class='note' id='footnote-687'><a href='#note-687' class='key'>†</a></span> Israel forty years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S14_19' data-id='S14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth, but was overcome by her labor pains. </span>
<span class='v S14_20' data-id='S14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As she was dying, the women attending her said, “Don’t despair; you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay any attention. </span></div>

<span class='v S14_21' data-id='S14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>She named the boy Ichabod,<span class='note' id='footnote-688'><a href='#note-688' class='key'>‡</a></span> saying, “The Glory has departed from Israel”—because of the capture of the ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband. </span>
<span class='v S14_22' data-id='S14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>She said, “The Glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured.” </span></div></div>
