<span class='v ZC4_1' data-id='ZC4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the angel who talked with me returned and woke me up, like someone awakened from sleep. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He asked me, “What do you see?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'>I answered, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels to the lamps. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_3' data-id='ZC4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Also there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_4' data-id='ZC4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I asked the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He answered, “Do you not know what these are?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'>“No, my lord,” I replied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_6' data-id='ZC4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So he said to me, “This is the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_7' data-id='ZC4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. Then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of ‘God bless it! God bless it!’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_8' data-id='ZC4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> came to me: </span>
<span class='v ZC4_9' data-id='ZC4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> Almighty has sent me to you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_10' data-id='ZC4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Who dares despise the day of small things, since the seven eyes of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> that range throughout the earth will rejoice when they see the chosen capstone<span class='note' id='footnote-2405'><a href='#note-2405' class='key'>*</a></span> in the hand of Zerubbabel?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_11' data-id='ZC4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I asked the angel, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_12' data-id='ZC4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Again I asked him, “What are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_13' data-id='ZC4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” </span></div>
