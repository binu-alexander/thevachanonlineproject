<div class='s'>Renewal of the Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_1' data-id='DT29_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>These are the terms of the covenant the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Horeb. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_2' data-id='DT29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Moses summoned all the Israelites and said to them: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_2' data-id='DT29_2'>Your eyes have seen all that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did in Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his officials and to all his land. </span>
<span class='v DT29_3' data-id='DT29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>With your own eyes you saw those great trials, those signs and great wonders. </span>
<span class='v DT29_4' data-id='DT29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But to this day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear. </span>
<span class='v DT29_5' data-id='DT29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Yet the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says, “During the forty years that I led you through the wilderness, your clothes did not wear out, nor did the sandals on your feet. </span>
<span class='v DT29_6' data-id='DT29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_7' data-id='DT29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them. </span>
<span class='v DT29_8' data-id='DT29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_9' data-id='DT29_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Carefully follow the terms of this covenant, so that you may prosper in everything you do. </span>
<span class='v DT29_10' data-id='DT29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>All of you are standing today in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God—your leaders and chief men, your elders and officials, and all the other men of Israel, </span>
<span class='v DT29_11' data-id='DT29_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>together with your children and your wives, and the foreigners living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water. </span>
<span class='v DT29_12' data-id='DT29_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>You are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God, a covenant the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is making with you this day and sealing with an oath, </span>
<span class='v DT29_13' data-id='DT29_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>to confirm you this day as his people, that he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. </span>
<span class='v DT29_14' data-id='DT29_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am making this covenant, with its oath, not only with you </span>
<span class='v DT29_15' data-id='DT29_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>who are standing here with us today in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God but also with those who are not here today. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_16' data-id='DT29_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know how we lived in Egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here. </span>
<span class='v DT29_17' data-id='DT29_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold. </span>
<span class='v DT29_18' data-id='DT29_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God to go and worship the gods of those nations; make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_19' data-id='DT29_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves, thinking, “I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,” they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. </span>
<span class='v DT29_20' data-id='DT29_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will never be willing to forgive them; his wrath and zeal will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will fall on them, and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will blot out their names from under heaven. </span>
<span class='v DT29_21' data-id='DT29_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_22' data-id='DT29_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has afflicted it. </span>
<span class='v DT29_23' data-id='DT29_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur—nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it. It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboyim, which the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> overthrew in fierce anger. </span>
<span class='v DT29_24' data-id='DT29_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>All the nations will ask: “Why has the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> done this to this land? Why this fierce, burning anger?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_25' data-id='DT29_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the answer will be: “It is because this people abandoned the covenant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of their ancestors, the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v DT29_26' data-id='DT29_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them, gods they did not know, gods he had not given them. </span>
<span class='v DT29_27' data-id='DT29_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Therefore the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s anger burned against this land, so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book. </span>
<span class='v DT29_28' data-id='DT29_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In furious anger and in great wrath the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land, as it is now.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT29_29' data-id='DT29_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The secret things belong to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law. </span></div></div>
