<div class='s'>The People Rebel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_1' data-id='NU14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>That night all the members of the community raised their voices and wept aloud. </span>
<span class='v NU14_2' data-id='NU14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>All the Israelites grumbled against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had died in Egypt! Or in this wilderness! </span>
<span class='v NU14_3' data-id='NU14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Why is the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Wouldn’t it be better for us to go back to Egypt?” </span>
<span class='v NU14_4' data-id='NU14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they said to each other, “We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_5' data-id='NU14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole Israelite assembly gathered there. </span>
<span class='v NU14_6' data-id='NU14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their clothes </span>
<span class='v NU14_7' data-id='NU14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and said to the entire Israelite assembly, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good. </span>
<span class='v NU14_8' data-id='NU14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is pleased with us, he will lead us into that land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and will give it to us. </span>
<span class='v NU14_9' data-id='NU14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Only do not rebel against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. And do not be afraid of the people of the land, because we will devour them. Their protection is gone, but the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is with us. Do not be afraid of them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_10' data-id='NU14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the whole assembly talked about stoning them. Then the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites. </span>
<span class='v NU14_11' data-id='NU14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me with contempt? How long will they refuse to believe in me, in spite of all the signs I have performed among them? </span>
<span class='v NU14_12' data-id='NU14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I will strike them down with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_13' data-id='NU14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Moses said to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, “Then the Egyptians will hear about it! By your power you brought these people up from among them. </span>
<span class='v NU14_14' data-id='NU14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it. They have already heard that you, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, are with these people and that you, <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, have been seen face to face, that your cloud stays over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. </span>
<span class='v NU14_15' data-id='NU14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If you put all these people to death, leaving none alive, the nations who have heard this report about you will say, </span>
<span class='v NU14_16' data-id='NU14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_17' data-id='NU14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Now may the Lord’s strength be displayed, just as you have declared: </span>
<span class='v NU14_18' data-id='NU14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>‘The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished; he punishes the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’ </span>
<span class='v NU14_19' data-id='NU14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In accordance with your great love, forgive the sin of these people, just as you have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_20' data-id='NU14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> replied, “I have forgiven them, as you asked. </span>
<span class='v NU14_21' data-id='NU14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as surely as the glory of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> fills the whole earth, </span>
<span class='v NU14_22' data-id='NU14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>not one of those who saw my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times— </span>
<span class='v NU14_23' data-id='NU14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. No one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it. </span>
<span class='v NU14_24' data-id='NU14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But because my servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he went to, and his descendants will inherit it. </span>
<span class='v NU14_25' data-id='NU14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the Red Sea.<span class='note' id='footnote-447'><a href='#note-447' class='key'>*</a></span>” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_26' data-id='NU14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron: </span>
<span class='v NU14_27' data-id='NU14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the complaints of these grumbling Israelites. </span>
<span class='v NU14_28' data-id='NU14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, I will do to you the very thing I heard you say: </span>
<span class='v NU14_29' data-id='NU14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me. </span>
<span class='v NU14_30' data-id='NU14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. </span>
<span class='v NU14_31' data-id='NU14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>As for your children that you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected. </span>
<span class='v NU14_32' data-id='NU14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But as for you, your bodies will fall in this wilderness. </span>
<span class='v NU14_33' data-id='NU14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, suffering for your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v NU14_34' data-id='NU14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.’ </span>
<span class='v NU14_35' data-id='NU14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>I, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this whole wicked community, which has banded together against me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_36' data-id='NU14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it— </span>
<span class='v NU14_37' data-id='NU14_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>these men who were responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v NU14_38' data-id='NU14_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh survived. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_39' data-id='NU14_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned bitterly. </span>
<span class='v NU14_40' data-id='NU14_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> promised. Surely we have sinned!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_41' data-id='NU14_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>But Moses said, “Why are you disobeying the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s command? This will not succeed! </span>
<span class='v NU14_42' data-id='NU14_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Do not go up, because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is not with you. You will be defeated by your enemies, </span>
<span class='v NU14_43' data-id='NU14_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will face you there. Because you have turned away from the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU14_44' data-id='NU14_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up toward the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s covenant moved from the camp. </span>
<span class='v NU14_45' data-id='NU14_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to Hormah. </span></div></div>
