<div class='s'>The Plague of Frogs </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_1' data-id='EX8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. </span>
<span class='v EX8_2' data-id='EX8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. </span>
<span class='v EX8_3' data-id='EX8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and on your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs. </span>
<span class='v EX8_4' data-id='EX8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The frogs will come up on you and your people and all your officials.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_5' data-id='EX8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_6' data-id='EX8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land. </span>
<span class='v EX8_7' data-id='EX8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_8' data-id='EX8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_9' data-id='EX8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except for those that remain in the Nile.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_10' data-id='EX8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_10' data-id='EX8_10'>Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God. </span>
<span class='v EX8_11' data-id='EX8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_12' data-id='EX8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> about the frogs he had brought on Pharaoh. </span>
<span class='v EX8_13' data-id='EX8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards and in the fields. </span>
<span class='v EX8_14' data-id='EX8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them. </span>
<span class='v EX8_15' data-id='EX8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plague of Gnats </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_16' data-id='EX8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.” </span>
<span class='v EX8_17' data-id='EX8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. </span>
<span class='v EX8_18' data-id='EX8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_18' data-id='EX8_18'>Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere, </span>
<span class='v EX8_19' data-id='EX8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plague of Flies </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_20' data-id='EX8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says: Let my people go, so that they may worship me. </span>
<span class='v EX8_21' data-id='EX8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If you do not let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies; even the ground will be covered with them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_22' data-id='EX8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“ ‘But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where my people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, am in this land. </span>
<span class='v EX8_23' data-id='EX8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I will make a distinction<span class='note' id='footnote-241'><a href='#note-241' class='key'>*</a></span> between my people and your people. This sign will occur tomorrow.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_24' data-id='EX8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_25' data-id='EX8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_26' data-id='EX8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. And if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us? </span>
<span class='v EX8_27' data-id='EX8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> our God, as he commands us.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_28' data-id='EX8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_29' data-id='EX8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh and his officials and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure that he does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX8_30' data-id='EX8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, </span>
<span class='v EX8_31' data-id='EX8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not a fly remained. </span>
<span class='v EX8_32' data-id='EX8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go. </span></div></div>
