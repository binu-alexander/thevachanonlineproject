<div class='s'>Division of the Land West of the Jordan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_1' data-id='JS14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now these are the areas the Israelites received as an inheritance in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel allotted to them. </span>
<span class='v JS14_2' data-id='JS14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine-and-a-half tribes, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded through Moses. </span>
<span class='v JS14_3' data-id='JS14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Moses had granted the two-and-a-half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan but had not granted the Levites an inheritance among the rest, </span>
<span class='v JS14_4' data-id='JS14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>for Joseph’s descendants had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds. </span>
<span class='v JS14_5' data-id='JS14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the Israelites divided the land, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded Moses. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Allotment for Caleb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_6' data-id='JS14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me. </span>
<span class='v JS14_7' data-id='JS14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. And I brought him back a report according to my convictions, </span>
<span class='v JS14_8' data-id='JS14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt in fear. I, however, followed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God wholeheartedly. </span>
<span class='v JS14_9' data-id='JS14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> my God wholeheartedly.’<span class='note' id='footnote-580'><a href='#note-580' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_10' data-id='JS14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Now then, just as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> promised, he has kept me alive for forty-five years since the time he said this to Moses, while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old! </span>
<span class='v JS14_11' data-id='JS14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then. </span>
<span class='v JS14_12' data-id='JS14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now give me this hill country that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified, but, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> helping me, I will drive them out just as he said.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_13' data-id='JS14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance. </span>
<span class='v JS14_14' data-id='JS14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly. </span>
<span class='v JS14_15' data-id='JS14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakites.) </span></div>
