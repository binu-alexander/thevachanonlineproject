<div class='s'>The Parable of the Sower </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_1' data-id='LK8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, </span>
<span class='v LK8_2' data-id='LK8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out; </span>
<span class='v LK8_3' data-id='LK8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Joanna the wife of Chuza, the manager of Herod’s household; Susanna; and many others. These women were helping to support them out of their own means. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_4' data-id='LK8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from town after town, he told this parable: </span>
<span class='v LK8_5' data-id='LK8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path; it was trampled on, and the birds ate it up.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_6' data-id='LK8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Some fell on rocky ground, and when it came up, the plants withered because they had no moisture.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_7' data-id='LK8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked the plants.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_8' data-id='LK8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Still other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop, a hundred times more than was sown.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_8' data-id='LK8_8'>When he said this, he called out, <span class='wj'>“Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_9' data-id='LK8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>His disciples asked him what this parable meant. </span>
<span class='v LK8_10' data-id='LK8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He said, <span class='wj'>“The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that, </span></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK8_10' data-id='LK8_10'><span class='wj'>“ ‘though seeing, they may not see; </span></span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK8_10' data-id='LK8_10'><span class='wj'>though hearing, they may not understand.’ </span><span class='note' id='footnote-2649'><a href='#note-2649' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_11' data-id='LK8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_12' data-id='LK8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_13' data-id='LK8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_14' data-id='LK8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life’s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_15' data-id='LK8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>A Lamp on a Stand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_16' data-id='LK8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“No one lights a lamp and hides it in a clay jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a stand, so that those who come in can see the light.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_17' data-id='LK8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open.</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_18' data-id='LK8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Therefore consider carefully how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they have will be taken from them.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus’ Mother and Brothers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_19' data-id='LK8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd. </span>
<span class='v LK8_20' data-id='LK8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_21' data-id='LK8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He replied, <span class='wj'>“My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and put it into practice.”</span></span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calms the Storm </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_22' data-id='LK8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>One day Jesus said to his disciples, <span class='wj'>“Let us go over to the other side of the lake.”</span> So they got into a boat and set out. </span>
<span class='v LK8_23' data-id='LK8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in great danger. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_24' data-id='LK8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The disciples went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to drown!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_24' data-id='LK8_24'>He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm. </span>
<span class='v LK8_25' data-id='LK8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Where is your faith?”</span> he asked his disciples. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_25' data-id='LK8_25'>In fear and amazement they asked one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Restores a Demon-Possessed Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_26' data-id='LK8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,<span class='note' id='footnote-2650'><a href='#note-2650' class='key'>†</a></span> which is across the lake from Galilee. </span>
<span class='v LK8_27' data-id='LK8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a demon-possessed man from the town. For a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs. </span>
<span class='v LK8_28' data-id='LK8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” </span>
<span class='v LK8_29' data-id='LK8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had commanded the impure spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_30' data-id='LK8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus asked him, <span class='wj'>“What is your name?”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_30' data-id='LK8_30'>“Legion,” he replied, because many demons had gone into him. </span>
<span class='v LK8_31' data-id='LK8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And they begged Jesus repeatedly not to order them to go into the Abyss. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_32' data-id='LK8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he gave them permission. </span>
<span class='v LK8_33' data-id='LK8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_34' data-id='LK8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, </span>
<span class='v LK8_35' data-id='LK8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, dressed and in his right mind; and they were afraid. </span>
<span class='v LK8_36' data-id='LK8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Those who had seen it told the people how the demon-possessed man had been cured. </span>
<span class='v LK8_37' data-id='LK8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overcome with fear. So he got into the boat and left. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_38' data-id='LK8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, </span>
<span class='v LK8_39' data-id='LK8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.”</span> So the man went away and told all over town how much Jesus had done for him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_40' data-id='LK8_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus returned, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. </span>
<span class='v LK8_41' data-id='LK8_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, came and fell at Jesus’ feet, pleading with him to come to his house </span>
<span class='v LK8_42' data-id='LK8_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_42' data-id='LK8_42'>As Jesus was on his way, the crowds almost crushed him. </span>
<span class='v LK8_43' data-id='LK8_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years,<span class='note' id='footnote-2651'><a href='#note-2651' class='key'>‡</a></span> but no one could heal her. </span>
<span class='v LK8_44' data-id='LK8_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>She came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding stopped. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_45' data-id='LK8_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Who touched me?”</span> Jesus asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_45' data-id='LK8_45'>When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_46' data-id='LK8_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Someone touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_47' data-id='LK8_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Then the woman, seeing that she could not go unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. </span>
<span class='v LK8_48' data-id='LK8_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then he said to her, <span class='wj'>“Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_49' data-id='LK8_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t bother the teacher anymore.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_50' data-id='LK8_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, <span class='wj'>“Don’t be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_51' data-id='LK8_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John and James, and the child’s father and mother. </span>
<span class='v LK8_52' data-id='LK8_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile, all the people were wailing and mourning for her. <span class='wj'>“Stop wailing,”</span> Jesus said. <span class='wj'>“She is not dead but asleep.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK8_53' data-id='LK8_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>They laughed at him, knowing that she was dead. </span>
<span class='v LK8_54' data-id='LK8_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>But he took her by the hand and said, <span class='wj'>“My child, get up!”</span></span>
<span class='v LK8_55' data-id='LK8_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Her spirit returned, and at once she stood up. Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. </span>
<span class='v LK8_56' data-id='LK8_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. </span></div></div>
