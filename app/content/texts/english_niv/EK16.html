<span class='v EK16_2' data-id='EK16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices </span>
<span class='v EK16_3' data-id='EK16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span> says to Jerusalem: Your ancestry and birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. </span>
<span class='v EK16_4' data-id='EK16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to make you clean, nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths. </span>
<span class='v EK16_5' data-id='EK16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you. Rather, you were thrown out into the open field, for on the day you were born you were despised. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_6' data-id='EK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Then I passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood, and as you lay there in your blood I said to you, “Live!”<span class='note' id='footnote-2069'><a href='#note-2069' class='key'>*</a></span></span>
<span class='v EK16_7' data-id='EK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I made you grow like a plant of the field. You grew and developed and entered puberty. Your breasts had formed and your hair had grown, yet you were stark naked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_8' data-id='EK16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Later I passed by, and when I looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love, I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your naked body. I gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and you became mine. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_9' data-id='EK16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“ ‘I bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you. </span>
<span class='v EK16_10' data-id='EK16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I clothed you with an embroidered dress and put sandals of fine leather on you. I dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments. </span>
<span class='v EK16_11' data-id='EK16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I adorned you with jewelry: I put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck, </span>

<span class='v EK16_13' data-id='EK16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So you were adorned with gold and silver; your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth. Your food was honey, olive oil and the finest flour. You became very beautiful and rose to be a queen. </span>
<span class='v EK16_14' data-id='EK16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty, because the splendor I had given you made your beauty perfect, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_17' data-id='EK16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You also took the fine jewelry I gave you, the jewelry made of my gold and silver, and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them. </span>
<span class='v EK16_18' data-id='EK16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And you took your embroidered clothes to put on them, and you offered my oil and incense before them. </span>
<span class='v EK16_19' data-id='EK16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Also the food I provided for you—the flour, olive oil and honey I gave you to eat—you offered as fragrant incense before them. That is what happened, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_20' data-id='EK16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“ ‘And you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols. Was your prostitution not enough? </span>
<span class='v EK16_21' data-id='EK16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols. </span>
<span class='v EK16_22' data-id='EK16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, kicking about in your blood. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_23' data-id='EK16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Woe! Woe to you, declares the Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. In addition to all your other wickedness, </span>
<span class='v EK16_24' data-id='EK16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square. </span>
<span class='v EK16_25' data-id='EK16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At every street corner you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty, spreading your legs with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by. </span>
<span class='v EK16_26' data-id='EK16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>You engaged in prostitution with the Egyptians, your neighbors with large genitals, and aroused my anger with your increasing promiscuity. </span>
<span class='v EK16_27' data-id='EK16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory; I gave you over to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were shocked by your lewd conduct. </span>
<span class='v EK16_28' data-id='EK16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You engaged in prostitution with the Assyrians too, because you were insatiable; and even after that, you still were not satisfied. </span>
<span class='v EK16_29' data-id='EK16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then you increased your promiscuity to include Babylonia,<span class='note' id='footnote-2071'><a href='#note-2071' class='key'>‡</a></span> a land of merchants, but even with this you were not satisfied. </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<span class='v EK16_31' data-id='EK16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>When you built your mounds at every street corner and made your lofty shrines in every public square, you were unlike a prostitute, because you scorned payment. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_34' data-id='EK16_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So in your prostitution you are the opposite of others; no one runs after you for your favors. You are the very opposite, for you give payment and none is given to you. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_37' data-id='EK16_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>therefore I am going to gather all your lovers, with whom you found pleasure, those you loved as well as those you hated.

<span class='v EK16_38' data-id='EK16_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>I will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood; I will bring on you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger. </span>
<span class='v EK16_39' data-id='EK16_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then I will deliver you into the hands of your lovers, and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines.

<span class='v EK16_40' data-id='EK16_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>They will bring a mob against you, who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords. </span>
<span class='v EK16_41' data-id='EK16_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>They will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women. I will put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers. </span>
<span class='v EK16_42' data-id='EK16_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you; I will be calm and no longer angry. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_44' data-id='EK16_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>“ ‘Everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.” </span>
<span class='v EK16_45' data-id='EK16_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>You are a true daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children; and you are a true sister of your sisters, who despised their husbands and their children.

<span class='v EK16_46' data-id='EK16_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Your older sister was Samaria, who lived to the north of you with her daughters; and your younger sister, who lived to the south of you with her daughters, was Sodom. </span>
<span class='v EK16_47' data-id='EK16_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>You not only followed their ways and copied their detestable practices, but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they. </span>

<span class='v EK16_50' data-id='EK16_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>They were haughty and did detestable things before me. Therefore I did away with them as you have seen. </span>
<span class='v EK16_51' data-id='EK16_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Samaria did not commit half the sins you did. You have done more detestable things than they, and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done. </span>

<span class='v EK16_58' data-id='EK16_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>You will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices, declares the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span></div>
