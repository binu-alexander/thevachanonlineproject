<span class='v RV2_1' data-id='RV2_1'><span class='wj'>These are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_2' data-id='RV2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I know your deeds, your hard work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_3' data-id='RV2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>You have persevered and have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_4' data-id='RV2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_5' data-id='RV2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the things you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_6' data-id='RV2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_7' data-id='RV2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_8' data-id='RV2_8'><span class='wj'>These are the words of him who is the First and the Last, who died and came to life again.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_9' data-id='RV2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I know your afflictions and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_10' data-id='RV2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you life as your victor’s crown.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_11' data-id='RV2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death.</span></span></div>

<span class='v RV2_12' data-id='RV2_12'><span class='wj'>These are the words of him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_13' data-id='RV2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I know where you live—where Satan has his throne. Yet you remain true to my name. You did not renounce your faith in me, not even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was put to death in your city—where Satan lives.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_14' data-id='RV2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols and committed sexual immorality.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_15' data-id='RV2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Likewise, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_16' data-id='RV2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span></span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_20' data-id='RV2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet.

<span class='v RV2_21' data-id='RV2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_22' data-id='RV2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>So I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.</span></span>
<span class='v RV2_23' data-id='RV2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV2_24' data-id='RV2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, ‘I will not impose any other burden on you, </span></span>
