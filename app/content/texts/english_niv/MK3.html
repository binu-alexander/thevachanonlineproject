<div class='s'>Jesus Heals on the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_1' data-id='MK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Another time Jesus went into the synagogue, and a man with a shriveled hand was there. </span>
<span class='v MK3_2' data-id='MK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Some of them were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v MK3_3' data-id='MK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand, <span class='wj'>“Stand up in front of everyone.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_4' data-id='MK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus asked them, <span class='wj'>“Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?”</span> But they remained silent. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_5' data-id='MK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He looked around at them in anger and, deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts, said to the man, <span class='wj'>“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He stretched it out, and his hand was completely restored. </span>
<span class='v MK3_6' data-id='MK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Crowds Follow Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_7' data-id='MK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed. </span>
<span class='v MK3_8' data-id='MK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When they heard about all he was doing, many people came to him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and the regions across the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MK3_9' data-id='MK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him, to keep the people from crowding him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_10' data-id='MK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_11' data-id='MK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Whenever the impure spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_12' data-id='MK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But he gave them strict orders not to tell others about him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appoints the Twelve </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_13' data-id='MK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_14' data-id='MK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He appointed twelve<span class='note' id='footnote-2558'><a href='#note-2558' class='key'>*</a></span> that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach </span>
<span class='v MK3_15' data-id='MK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and to have authority to drive out demons. </span>
<span class='v MK3_16' data-id='MK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These are the twelve he appointed: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter), </span>
<span class='v MK3_17' data-id='MK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>James son of Zebedee and his brother John (to them he gave the name Boanerges, which means “sons of thunder”), </span>
<span class='v MK3_18' data-id='MK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot </span>
<span class='v MK3_19' data-id='MK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Accused by His Family and by Teachers of the Law </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_20' data-id='MK3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. </span>
<span class='v MK3_21' data-id='MK3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When his family<span class='note' id='footnote-2559'><a href='#note-2559' class='key'>†</a></span> heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_22' data-id='MK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_23' data-id='MK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables: <span class='wj'>“How can Satan drive out Satan?</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_24' data-id='MK3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_25' data-id='MK3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_26' data-id='MK3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come.</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_27' data-id='MK3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>In fact, no one can enter a strong man’s house without first tying him up. Then he can plunder the strong man’s house.</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_28' data-id='MK3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and every slander they utter, </span></span>
<span class='v MK3_29' data-id='MK3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an eternal sin.”</span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_30' data-id='MK3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He said this because they were saying, “He has an impure spirit.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_31' data-id='MK3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_32' data-id='MK3_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>A crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_33' data-id='MK3_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span> he asked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_34' data-id='MK3_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said, <span class='wj'>“Here are my mother and my brothers!</span></span>
<span class='v MK3_35' data-id='MK3_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span><span class='wj'>Whoever does God’s will is my brother and sister and mother.”</span></span></div></div>
