And all the men of Jabesh said to him, “Make a treaty with us, and we will be subject to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_2' data-id='S111_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I will make a treaty with you only on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_3' data-id='S111_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout Israel; if no one comes to rescue us, we will surrender to you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_4' data-id='S111_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported these terms to the people, they all wept aloud. </span>
<span class='v S111_5' data-id='S111_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Just then Saul was returning from the fields, behind his oxen, and he asked, “What is wrong with everyone? Why are they weeping?” Then they repeated to him what the men of Jabesh had said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_6' data-id='S111_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Saul heard their words, the Spirit of God came powerfully upon him, and he burned with anger. </span>
<span class='v S111_7' data-id='S111_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He took a pair of oxen, cut them into pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers throughout Israel, proclaiming, “This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” Then the terror of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> fell on the people, and they came out together as one. </span>
<span class='v S111_8' data-id='S111_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Saul mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel numbered three hundred thousand and those of Judah thirty thousand. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_9' data-id='S111_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They told the messengers who had come, “Say to the men of Jabesh Gilead, ‘By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued.’ ” When the messengers went and reported this to the men of Jabesh, they were elated. </span>
<span class='v S111_10' data-id='S111_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They said to the Ammonites, “Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do to us whatever you like.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_11' data-id='S111_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The next day Saul separated his men into three divisions; during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the Ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Saul Confirmed as King </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_12' data-id='S111_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The people then said to Samuel, “Who was it that asked, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Turn these men over to us so that we may put them to death.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_13' data-id='S111_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this day the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has rescued Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S111_14' data-id='S111_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingship.” </span>
<span class='v S111_15' data-id='S111_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So all the people went to Gilgal and made Saul king in the presence of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. There they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, and Saul and all the Israelites held a great celebration. </span></div></div>
