<div class='s'>Jacob Returns to Bethel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_1' data-id='GN35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_2' data-id='GN35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. </span>
<span class='v GN35_3' data-id='GN35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_4' data-id='GN35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem. </span>
<span class='v GN35_5' data-id='GN35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_6' data-id='GN35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class='v GN35_7' data-id='GN35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel,<span class='note' id='footnote-157'><a href='#note-157' class='key'>*</a></span> because it was there that God revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_8' data-id='GN35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.<span class='note' id='footnote-158'><a href='#note-158' class='key'>†</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_9' data-id='GN35_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram,<span class='note' id='footnote-159'><a href='#note-159' class='key'>‡</a></span> God appeared to him again and blessed him. </span>
<span class='v GN35_10' data-id='GN35_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>God said to him, “Your name is Jacob,<span class='note' id='footnote-160'><a href='#note-160' class='key'>§</a></span> but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.<span class='note' id='footnote-161'><a href='#note-161' class='key'>*</a></span>” So he named him Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_11' data-id='GN35_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And God said to him, “I am God Almighty<span class='note' id='footnote-162'><a href='#note-162' class='key'>†</a></span>; be fruitful and increase in number.

<span class='v GN35_12' data-id='GN35_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_13' data-id='GN35_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then God went up from him at the place where he had talked with him. </span></div>

<span class='v GN35_14' data-id='GN35_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it. </span>
<span class='v GN35_15' data-id='GN35_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.<span class='note' id='footnote-163'><a href='#note-163' class='key'>‡</a></span></span></div>

<span class='v GN35_17' data-id='GN35_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t despair, for you have another son.” </span>
<span class='v GN35_18' data-id='GN35_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni.<span class='note' id='footnote-164'><a href='#note-164' class='key'>§</a></span> But his father named him Benjamin.<span class='note' id='footnote-165'><a href='#note-165' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN35_19' data-id='GN35_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). </span>
