<div class='s'>Not Because of Israel’s Righteousness </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_1' data-id='DT9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Hear, Israel: You are now about to cross the Jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities that have walls up to the sky. </span>
<span class='v DT9_2' data-id='DT9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The people are strong and tall—Anakites! You know about them and have heard it said: “Who can stand up against the Anakites?” </span>
<span class='v DT9_3' data-id='DT9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But be assured today that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them; he will subdue them before you. And you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly, as the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has promised you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_4' data-id='DT9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>After the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God has driven them out before you, do not say to yourself, “The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> is going to drive them out before you. </span>
<span class='v DT9_5' data-id='DT9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. </span>
<span class='v DT9_6' data-id='DT9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Understand, then, that it is not because of your righteousness that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiff-necked people. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Golden Calf </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_7' data-id='DT9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Remember this and never forget how you aroused the anger of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>. </span>
<span class='v DT9_8' data-id='DT9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>At Horeb you aroused the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you. </span>
<span class='v DT9_9' data-id='DT9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When I went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had made with you, I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water. </span>
<span class='v DT9_10' data-id='DT9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God. On them were all the commandments the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire, on the day of the assembly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_11' data-id='DT9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>At the end of the forty days and forty nights, the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> gave me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant. </span>
<span class='v DT9_12' data-id='DT9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> told me, “Go down from here at once, because your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned away quickly from what I commanded them and have made an idol for themselves.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_13' data-id='DT9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to me, “I have seen this people, and they are a stiff-necked people indeed! </span>
<span class='v DT9_14' data-id='DT9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. And I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_15' data-id='DT9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So I turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire. And the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. </span>
<span class='v DT9_16' data-id='DT9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When I looked, I saw that you had sinned against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God; you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had commanded you. </span>
<span class='v DT9_17' data-id='DT9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them to pieces before your eyes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_18' data-id='DT9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then once again I fell prostrate before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> for forty days and forty nights; I ate no bread and drank no water, because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>’s sight and so arousing his anger. </span>
<span class='v DT9_19' data-id='DT9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I feared the anger and wrath of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, for he was angry enough with you to destroy you. But again the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> listened to me. </span>
<span class='v DT9_20' data-id='DT9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but at that time I prayed for Aaron too. </span>
<span class='v DT9_21' data-id='DT9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Also I took that sinful thing of yours, the calf you had made, and burned it in the fire. Then I crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_22' data-id='DT9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You also made the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> angry at Taberah, at Massah and at Kibroth Hattaavah. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_23' data-id='DT9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> sent you out from Kadesh Barnea, he said, “Go up and take possession of the land I have given you.” But you rebelled against the command of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> your God. You did not trust him or obey him. </span>
<span class='v DT9_24' data-id='DT9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You have been rebellious against the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> ever since I have known you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT9_25' data-id='DT9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I lay prostrate before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> those forty days and forty nights because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had said he would destroy you. </span>
<span class='v DT9_26' data-id='DT9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I prayed to the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> and said, “Sovereign <span class='nd'>Lord</span>, do not destroy your people, your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. </span>
<span class='v DT9_27' data-id='DT9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Overlook the stubbornness of this people, their wickedness and their sin. </span>
<span class='v DT9_28' data-id='DT9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, the country from which you brought us will say, ‘Because the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> was not able to take them into the land he had promised them, and because he hated them, he brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.’ </span>
<span class='v DT9_29' data-id='DT9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But they are your people, your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm.” </span></div></div>
