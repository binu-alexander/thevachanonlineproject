<div class='s'>The Woman and the Dragon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV12_1' data-id='RV12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. </span>
<span class='v RV12_2' data-id='RV12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth. </span>
<span class='v RV12_3' data-id='RV12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. </span>
<span class='v RV12_4' data-id='RV12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth. The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born. </span>
<span class='v RV12_5' data-id='RV12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>She gave birth to a son, a male child, who “will rule all the nations with an iron scepter.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3294'><a href='#note-3294' class='key'>*</a></span> And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne. </span>
<span class='v RV12_6' data-id='RV12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV12_7' data-id='RV12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. </span>
<span class='v RV12_8' data-id='RV12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. </span>
<span class='v RV12_9' data-id='RV12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>“Now have come the salvation and the power </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>and the kingdom of our God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>and the authority of his Messiah. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>who accuses them before our God day and night, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_10' data-id='RV12_10'>has been hurled down. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They triumphed over him </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'>by the blood of the Lamb </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'>and by the word of their testimony; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'>they did not love their lives so much </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_11' data-id='RV12_11'>as to shrink from death. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore rejoice, you heavens </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'>and you who dwell in them! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'>But woe to the earth and the sea, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'>because the devil has gone down to you! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'>He is filled with fury, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV12_12' data-id='RV12_12'>because he knows that his time is short.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV12_13' data-id='RV12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. </span>
<span class='v RV12_14' data-id='RV12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be taken care of for a time, times and half a time, out of the serpent’s reach. </span>
<span class='v RV12_15' data-id='RV12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river, to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent. </span>
<span class='v RV12_16' data-id='RV12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth. </span>
<span class='v RV12_17' data-id='RV12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offspring—those who keep God’s commands and hold fast their testimony about Jesus. </span></div></div>
