<div class='s'>The Three Visitors </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_1' data-id='GN18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> appeared to Abraham near the great trees of Mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day. </span>
<span class='v GN18_2' data-id='GN18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_3' data-id='GN18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He said, “If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord,<span class='note' id='footnote-72'><a href='#note-72' class='key'>*</a></span> do not pass your servant by. </span>
<span class='v GN18_4' data-id='GN18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. </span>
<span class='v GN18_5' data-id='GN18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_5' data-id='GN18_5'>“Very well,” they answered, “do as you say.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_6' data-id='GN18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah. “Quick,” he said, “get three seahs<span class='note' id='footnote-73'><a href='#note-73' class='key'>†</a></span> of the finest flour and knead it and bake some bread.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_7' data-id='GN18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he ran to the herd and selected a choice, tender calf and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it. </span>
<span class='v GN18_8' data-id='GN18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared, and set these before them. While they ate, he stood near them under a tree. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_9' data-id='GN18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_9' data-id='GN18_9'>“There, in the tent,” he said. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_10' data-id='GN18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then one of them said, “I will surely return to you about this time next year, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_10' data-id='GN18_10'>Now Sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent, which was behind him. </span>
<span class='v GN18_11' data-id='GN18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Abraham and Sarah were already very old, and Sarah was past the age of childbearing. </span>
<span class='v GN18_12' data-id='GN18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So Sarah laughed to herself as she thought, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I now have this pleasure?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_13' data-id='GN18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Will I really have a child, now that I am old?’ </span>
<span class='v GN18_14' data-id='GN18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Is anything too hard for the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>? I will return to you at the appointed time next year, and Sarah will have a son.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_15' data-id='GN18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I did not laugh.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_15' data-id='GN18_15'>But he said, “Yes, you did laugh.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Abraham Pleads for Sodom </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_16' data-id='GN18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When the men got up to leave, they looked down toward Sodom, and Abraham walked along with them to see them on their way. </span>
<span class='v GN18_17' data-id='GN18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do? </span>
<span class='v GN18_18' data-id='GN18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.<span class='note' id='footnote-74'><a href='#note-74' class='key'>‡</a></span></span>
<span class='v GN18_19' data-id='GN18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For I have chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> by doing what is right and just, so that the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> will bring about for Abraham what he has promised him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_20' data-id='GN18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous </span>
<span class='v GN18_21' data-id='GN18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_22' data-id='GN18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The men turned away and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the <span class='nd'>Lord</span>.<span class='note' id='footnote-75'><a href='#note-75' class='key'>§</a></span></span>
<span class='v GN18_23' data-id='GN18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? </span>
<span class='v GN18_24' data-id='GN18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare<span class='note' id='footnote-76'><a href='#note-76' class='key'>*</a></span> the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? </span>
<span class='v GN18_25' data-id='GN18_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_26' data-id='GN18_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The <span class='nd'>Lord</span> said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_27' data-id='GN18_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I am nothing but dust and ashes, </span>
<span class='v GN18_28' data-id='GN18_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five people?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_28' data-id='GN18_28'>“If I find forty-five there,” he said, “I will not destroy it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_29' data-id='GN18_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Once again he spoke to him, “What if only forty are found there?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_29' data-id='GN18_29'>He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_30' data-id='GN18_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak. What if only thirty can be found there?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_30' data-id='GN18_30'>He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_31' data-id='GN18_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, what if only twenty can be found there?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_31' data-id='GN18_31'>He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_32' data-id='GN18_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more. What if only ten can be found there?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_32' data-id='GN18_32'>He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN18_33' data-id='GN18_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When the <span class='nd'>Lord</span> had finished speaking with Abraham, he left, and Abraham returned home. </span></div></div>
