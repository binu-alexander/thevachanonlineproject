<span class='v GL4_1' data-id='GL4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>What I am saying is that as long as an heir is underage, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. </span>
<span class='v GL4_2' data-id='GL4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The heir is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. </span>
<span class='v GL4_3' data-id='GL4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So also, when we were underage, we were in slavery under the elemental spiritual forces<span class='note' id='footnote-3054'><a href='#note-3054' class='key'>*</a></span> of the world. </span>
<span class='v GL4_4' data-id='GL4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But when the set time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, </span>
<span class='v GL4_5' data-id='GL4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to redeem those under the law, that we might receive adoption to sonship.<span class='note' id='footnote-3055'><a href='#note-3055' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL4_6' data-id='GL4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because you are his sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, the Spirit who calls out, <span class='tl'>“Abba</span>,<span class='note' id='footnote-3056'><a href='#note-3056' class='key'>‡</a></span> Father.” </span>
<span class='v GL4_7' data-id='GL4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So you are no longer a slave, but God’s child; and since you are his child, God has made you also an heir. </span></div>

<span class='v GL4_8' data-id='GL4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods. </span>
<span class='v GL4_9' data-id='GL4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But now that you know God—or rather are known by God—how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable forces<span class='note' id='footnote-3057'><a href='#note-3057' class='key'>§</a></span>? Do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again? </span>
<span class='v GL4_10' data-id='GL4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You are observing special days and months and seasons and years! </span>
<span class='v GL4_11' data-id='GL4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I fear for you, that somehow I have wasted my efforts on you. </span></div>

<span class='v GL4_12' data-id='GL4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I plead with you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You did me no wrong. </span>
<span class='v GL4_13' data-id='GL4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As you know, it was because of an illness that I first preached the gospel to you, </span>
<span class='v GL4_14' data-id='GL4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and even though my illness was a trial to you, you did not treat me with contempt or scorn. Instead, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as if I were Christ Jesus himself. </span>
<span class='v GL4_15' data-id='GL4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Where, then, is your blessing of me now? I can testify that, if you could have done so, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. </span>
<span class='v GL4_16' data-id='GL4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_17' data-id='GL4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Those people are zealous to win you over, but for no good. What they want is to alienate you from us, so that you may have zeal for them. </span>
<span class='v GL4_18' data-id='GL4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is fine to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you. </span>
<span class='v GL4_19' data-id='GL4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My dear children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you, </span>
<span class='v GL4_20' data-id='GL4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>how I wish I could be with you now and change my tone, because I am perplexed about you! </span></div>

<span class='v GL4_21' data-id='GL4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Tell me, you who want to be under the law, are you not aware of what the law says? </span>
<span class='v GL4_22' data-id='GL4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. </span>
<span class='v GL4_23' data-id='GL4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>His son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a divine promise. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_24' data-id='GL4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>These things are being taken figuratively: The women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai and bears children who are to be slaves: This is Hagar. </span>
<span class='v GL4_25' data-id='GL4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present city of Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children. </span>
<span class='v GL4_26' data-id='GL4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother. </span>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For it is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>“Be glad, barren woman, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>you who never bore a child; </span></div>

<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>shout for joy and cry aloud, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>you who were never in labor; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>because more are the children of the desolate woman </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>than of her who has a husband.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3058'><a href='#note-3058' class='key'>*</a></span></span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_28' data-id='GL4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. </span>
<span class='v GL4_29' data-id='GL4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. </span>
<span class='v GL4_30' data-id='GL4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But what does Scripture say? “Get rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman’s son.”<span class='note' id='footnote-3059'><a href='#note-3059' class='key'>†</a></span></span>
<span class='v GL4_31' data-id='GL4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman. </span></div></div>
