<span class='v HS14_3' data-id='HS14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Assyria will not be our salvation; we will not go on horses; we will not again say to the work of our hands, You are our gods; for in you there is mercy for the child who has no father. </span>
<span class='v HS14_4' data-id='HS14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will put right their errors; freely will my love be given to them, for my wrath is turned away from him. </span>
