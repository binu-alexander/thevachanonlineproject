<span class='v SS5_1' data-id='SS5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; to take my myrrh with my spice; my wax with my honey; my wine with my milk. Take meat, O friends; take wine, yes, be overcome with love. </span>
<span class='v SS5_2' data-id='SS5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I am sleeping, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my loved one at the door, saying, Be open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my very beautiful one; my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night. </span>
<span class='v SS5_3' data-id='SS5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I have put off my coat; how may I put it on? My feet are washed; how may I make them unclean? </span>
<span class='v SS5_4' data-id='SS5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>My loved one put his hand on the door, and my heart was moved for him. </span>
<span class='v SS5_5' data-id='SS5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I got up to let my loved one in; and my hands were dropping with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the lock of the door. </span>
<span class='v SS5_6' data-id='SS5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I made the door open to my loved one; but my loved one had taken himself away, and was gone, my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me; I went after him, but I did not come near him; I said his name, but he gave me no answer. </span>
<span class='v SS5_7' data-id='SS5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The keepers who go about the town overtook me; they gave me blows and wounds; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. </span>
<span class='v SS5_8' data-id='SS5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you see my loved one, what will you say to him? That I am overcome with love. </span>
<span class='v SS5_9' data-id='SS5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What is your loved one more than another, O fairest among women? What is your loved one more than another, that you say this to us? </span>
<span class='v SS5_10' data-id='SS5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>My loved one is white and red, the chief among ten thousand. </span>
<span class='v SS5_11' data-id='SS5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>His head is as the most delicate gold; his hair is thick, and black as a raven. </span>
<span class='v SS5_12' data-id='SS5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams, washed with milk, and rightly placed. </span>
<span class='v SS5_13' data-id='SS5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>His face is as beds of spices, giving out perfumes of every sort; his lips like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. </span>
<span class='v SS5_14' data-id='SS5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>His hands are as rings of gold ornamented with beryl-stones; his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires. </span>
<span class='v SS5_15' data-id='SS5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>His legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold; his looks are as Lebanon, beautiful as the cedar-tree. </span>
<span class='v SS5_16' data-id='SS5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>His mouth is most sweet; yes, he is all beautiful. This is my loved one, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. </span></div></div>
