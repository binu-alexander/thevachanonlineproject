<span class='v EX20_1' data-id='EX20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And God said all these words: </span>
<span class='v EX20_2' data-id='EX20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I am the Lord your God who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house. </span>
<span class='v EX20_3' data-id='EX20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You are to have no other gods but me. </span>
<span class='v EX20_4' data-id='EX20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth: </span>
<span class='v EX20_5' data-id='EX20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters; </span>
<span class='v EX20_6' data-id='EX20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws. </span>
<span class='v EX20_7' data-id='EX20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord </span>
<span class='v EX20_8' data-id='EX20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day. </span>
<span class='v EX20_9' data-id='EX20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>On six days do all your work: </span>
<span class='v EX20_10' data-id='EX20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-servant or your woman-servant, your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you: </span>
<span class='v EX20_11' data-id='EX20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy. </span>
<span class='v EX20_12' data-id='EX20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. </span>
<span class='v EX20_13' data-id='EX20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Do not put anyone to death without cause. </span>
<span class='v EX20_14' data-id='EX20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Do not be false to the married relation. </span>
<span class='v EX20_15' data-id='EX20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not take the property of another. </span>
<span class='v EX20_16' data-id='EX20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Do not give false witness against your neighbour. </span>
<span class='v EX20_17' data-id='EX20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let not your desire be turned to your neighbour's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his. </span>
<span class='v EX20_18' data-id='EX20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And all the people were watching the thunderings and the flames and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking; and when they saw it, they kept far off, shaking with fear. </span>
<span class='v EX20_19' data-id='EX20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And they said to Moses, To your words we will give ear, but let not the voice of God come to our ears, for fear death may come on us. </span>
<span class='v EX20_20' data-id='EX20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to the people, Have no fear: for God has come to put you to the test, so that fearing him you may be kept from sin. </span>
<span class='v EX20_21' data-id='EX20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the people kept their places far off, but Moses went near to the dark cloud where God was. </span>
<span class='v EX20_22' data-id='EX20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You yourselves have seen that my voice has come to you from heaven </span>
<span class='v EX20_23' data-id='EX20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Gods of silver and gods of gold you are not to make for yourselves. </span>
<span class='v EX20_24' data-id='EX20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Make for me an altar of earth, offering on it your burned offerings and your peace-offerings, your sheep and your oxen: in every place where I have put the memory of my name, I will come to you and give you my blessing. </span>
<span class='v EX20_25' data-id='EX20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And if you make me an altar of stone do not make it of cut stones: for the touch of an instrument will make it unclean. </span>
<span class='v EX20_26' data-id='EX20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And do not go up by steps to my altar, for fear that your bodies may be seen uncovered. </span></div></div>
