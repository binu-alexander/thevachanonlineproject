<span class='v JS6_1' data-id='JS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>(Now Jericho was all shut up because of the children of Israel: there was no going out or coming in.) </span>
<span class='v JS6_2' data-id='JS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Joshua, See, I have given into your hands Jericho with its king and all its men of war. </span>
<span class='v JS6_3' data-id='JS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now let all your fighting-men make a circle round the town, going all round it once. Do this for six days. </span>
<span class='v JS6_4' data-id='JS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And let seven priests go before the ark with seven loud-sounding horns in their hands: on the seventh day you are to go round the town seven times, the priests blowing their horns. </span>
<span class='v JS6_5' data-id='JS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And at the sound of a long note on the horns, let all the people give a loud cry; and the wall of the town will come down flat, and all the people are to go straight forward. </span>
<span class='v JS6_6' data-id='JS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua, the son of Nun, sent for the priests and said to them, Take up the ark of the agreement, and let seven priests take seven horns in their hands and go before the ark of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JS6_7' data-id='JS6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he said to the people, Go forward, circling the town, and let the armed men go before the ark of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JS6_8' data-id='JS6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So after Joshua had said this to the people, the seven priests with their seven horns went forward before the Lord, blowing on their horns: and the ark of the Lord's agreement went after them. </span>
<span class='v JS6_9' data-id='JS6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the armed men went before the priests who were blowing the horns, and the mass of the people went after the ark, blowing their horns. </span>
<span class='v JS6_10' data-id='JS6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And to the people Joshua gave an order, saying, You will give no cry, and make no sound, and let no word go out of your mouth till the day when I say, Give a loud cry; then give a loud cry. </span>
<span class='v JS6_11' data-id='JS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So he made the ark of the Lord go all round the town once: then they went back to the tents for the night. </span>
<span class='v JS6_12' data-id='JS6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning Joshua got up, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JS6_13' data-id='JS6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the seven priests with their seven horns went on before the ark of the Lord, blowing their horns: the armed men went before them, and the mass of the people went after the ark of the Lord, blowing their horns. </span>
<span class='v JS6_14' data-id='JS6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The second day they went all round the town once, and then went back to their tents: and so they did for six days. </span>
<span class='v JS6_15' data-id='JS6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then on the seventh day they got up early, at the dawn of the day, and went round the town in the same way, but that day they went round it seven times. </span>
<span class='v JS6_16' data-id='JS6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the seventh time, at the sound of the priests' horns, Joshua said to the people, Now give a loud cry; for the Lord has given you the town. </span>
<span class='v JS6_17' data-id='JS6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the town will be put to the curse, and everything in it will be given to the Lord: only Rahab, the loose woman, and all who are in the house with her, will be kept safe, because she kept secret the men we sent. </span>
<span class='v JS6_18' data-id='JS6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And as for you, keep yourselves from the cursed thing, for fear that you may get a desire for it and take some of it for yourselves, and so be the cause of a curse and great trouble on the tents of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JS6_19' data-id='JS6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But all the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron are holy to the Lord: they are to come into the store-house of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JS6_20' data-id='JS6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So the people gave a loud cry, and the horns were sounded; and on hearing the horns the people gave a loud cry, and the wall came down flat, so that the people went up into the town, every man going straight before him, and they took the town. </span>
<span class='v JS6_21' data-id='JS6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they put everything in the town to the curse; men and women, young and old, ox and sheep and ass, they put to death without mercy. </span>
<span class='v JS6_22' data-id='JS6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua said to the two men who had been sent to make a search through the land, Go into the house of the loose woman, and get her out, and all who are with her, as you gave her your oath. </span>
<span class='v JS6_23' data-id='JS6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So the searchers went in and got out Rahab and her father and mother and her brothers and all she had, and they got out all her family; and they took them outside the tents of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JS6_24' data-id='JS6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then, after burning up the town and everything in it, they put the silver and gold and the vessels of brass and iron into the store-house of the Lord's house. </span>
<span class='v JS6_25' data-id='JS6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Joshua kept Rahab, the loose woman, and her father's family and all she had, from death, and so she got a living-place among the children of Israel to this day; because she kept safe the men whom Joshua had sent to make a search through the land. </span>
<span class='v JS6_26' data-id='JS6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua gave the people orders with an oath, saying, Let that man be cursed before the Lord who puts his hand to the building up of this town: with the loss of his first son will he put the first stone of it in place, and with the loss of his youngest son he will put up its doors. </span>
<span class='v JS6_27' data-id='JS6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So the Lord was with Joshua; and news of him went through all the land. </span></div></div>
