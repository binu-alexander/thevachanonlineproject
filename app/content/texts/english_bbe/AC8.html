<span class='v AC8_1' data-id='AC8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Saul gave approval to his death. Now at that time a violent attack was started against the church in Jerusalem; and all but the Apostles went away into all parts of Judaea and Samaria. </span>
<span class='v AC8_2' data-id='AC8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And God-fearing men put Stephen's body in its last resting-place, making great weeping over him. </span>
<span class='v AC8_3' data-id='AC8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Saul was burning with hate against the church, going into every house and taking men and women and putting them in prison. </span>
<span class='v AC8_4' data-id='AC8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But those who had gone in flight went everywhere preaching the word. </span>
<span class='v AC8_5' data-id='AC8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Philip went down to Samaria and was teaching them about Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC8_6' data-id='AC8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And all the people gave attention to the words which Philip said, when they saw the signs which he did. </span>
<span class='v AC8_7' data-id='AC8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For unclean spirits came out from those who had them, crying with a loud voice; and a number of those who were ill and broken in body were made well. </span>
<span class='v AC8_8' data-id='AC8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And there was much joy in that town. </span>
<span class='v AC8_9' data-id='AC8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But there was a certain man named Simon, who in the past had been a wonder-worker and a cause of surprise to the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was a great man: </span>
<span class='v AC8_10' data-id='AC8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>To whom they all gave attention, from the smallest to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is named Great. </span>
<span class='v AC8_11' data-id='AC8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they gave attention to him, because for a long time his wonder-working powers had kept them under his control. </span>
<span class='v AC8_12' data-id='AC8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when they had faith in the good news given by Philip about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, a number of men and women had baptism. </span>
<span class='v AC8_13' data-id='AC8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Simon himself had faith and, having had baptism, he went with Philip and, seeing the signs and the great wonders which he did, he was full of surprise. </span>
<span class='v AC8_14' data-id='AC8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now when the Apostles at Jerusalem had news that the people of Samaria had taken the word of God into their hearts, they sent to them Peter and John; </span>
<span class='v AC8_15' data-id='AC8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Who, when they came there, made prayer for them, that the Holy Spirit might be given to them: </span>
<span class='v AC8_16' data-id='AC8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For up to that time he had not come on any of them; only baptism had been given to them in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC8_17' data-id='AC8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then they put their hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came on them. </span>
<span class='v AC8_18' data-id='AC8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the touch of the Apostles' hands, he made them an offering of money, saying, </span>
<span class='v AC8_19' data-id='AC8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Give me this power, so that when I put my hands on anyone he may get the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC8_20' data-id='AC8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, May your money come to destruction with you, because you had the idea that what is freely given by God may be got for a price. </span>
<span class='v AC8_21' data-id='AC8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You have no part in this business, because your heart is not right before God. </span>
<span class='v AC8_22' data-id='AC8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Let your heart be changed, and make prayer to God that you may have forgiveness for your evil thoughts. </span>
<span class='v AC8_23' data-id='AC8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For I see that you are prisoned in bitter envy and the chains of sin. </span>
<span class='v AC8_24' data-id='AC8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Simon, answering, said, Make prayer for me to the Lord, so that these things which you have said may not come on me. </span>
<span class='v AC8_25' data-id='AC8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So they, having given their witness and made clear the word of the Lord, went back to Jerusalem, giving the good news on their way in a number of the small towns of Samaria. </span>
<span class='v AC8_26' data-id='AC8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Get up, and go to the south, to the road which goes from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the waste land. </span>
<span class='v AC8_27' data-id='AC8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he went and there was a man of Ethiopia, a servant of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and controller of all her property, who had come up to Jerusalem for worship; </span>
<span class='v AC8_28' data-id='AC8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>He was going back, seated in his carriage, and was reading the book of the prophet Isaiah. </span>
<span class='v AC8_29' data-id='AC8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and get on his carriage. </span>
<span class='v AC8_30' data-id='AC8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Philip, running up to him, saw that he was reading Isaiah the prophet, and said to him, Is the sense of what you are reading clear to you? </span>
<span class='v AC8_31' data-id='AC8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said, How is that possible when I have no guide? And he made Philip get up by his side. </span>
<span class='v AC8_32' data-id='AC8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now the place in the book where he was reading was this: He was taken, like a sheep, to be put to death; and as a lamb is quiet when its wool is being cut, so he made no sound: </span>
<span class='v AC8_33' data-id='AC8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Being of low degree, his cause was not given a hearing: who has knowledge of his family? for his life is cut off from the earth. </span>
<span class='v AC8_34' data-id='AC8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And the Ethiopian said to Philip, About whom are these words said by the prophet? about himself, or some other? </span>
<span class='v AC8_35' data-id='AC8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So Philip, starting from this writing, gave him the good news about Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC8_36' data-id='AC8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And while they were going on their way, they came to some water, and the Ethiopian said, See, here is water; why may I not have baptism? </span>
<span class='v AC8_37' data-id='AC8_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>[] </span>
<span class='v AC8_38' data-id='AC8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he gave orders for the carriage to be stopped, and the two of them went down into the water, and Philip gave him baptism. </span>
<span class='v AC8_39' data-id='AC8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; and the Ethiopian saw him no more, for he went on his way full of joy. </span>
<span class='v AC8_40' data-id='AC8_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But Philip came to Azotus, and went through all the towns, preaching the good news, till he came to Caesarea. </span></div></div>
