<span class='v IS34_10' data-id='IS34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It will not be put out day or night; its smoke will go up for ever: it will be waste from generation to generation; no one will go through it for ever. </span>
<span class='v IS34_11' data-id='IS34_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the birds of the waste land will have their place there; it will be a heritage for the bittern and the raven: and it will be measured out with line and weight as a waste land. </span>
<span class='v IS34_12' data-id='IS34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The jackals will be there, and her great ones will be gone; they will say, There is no longer a kingdom there, and all her chiefs will have come to an end. </span>
<span class='v IS34_13' data-id='IS34_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And thorns will come up in her fair houses, and waste plants in her strong towers: and foxes will make their holes there, and it will be a meeting-place for ostriches. </span>
<span class='v IS34_14' data-id='IS34_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the beasts of the waste places will come together with the jackals, and the evil spirits will be crying to one another, even the night-spirit will come and make her resting-place there. </span>
<span class='v IS34_15' data-id='IS34_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The arrowsnake will make her hole and put her eggs there, and get her young together under her shade: there the hawks will come together by twos. </span>
