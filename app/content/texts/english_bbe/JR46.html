<span class='v JR46_2' data-id='JR46_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Of Egypt: about the army of Pharaoh-neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, overcame in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR46_3' data-id='JR46_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Get out the breastplate and body-cover, and come together to the fight. </span>
<span class='v JR46_4' data-id='JR46_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Make the horses ready, and get up, you horsemen, and take your places with your head-dresses; make the spears sharp and put on the breastplates. </span>
<span class='v JR46_5' data-id='JR46_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>What have I seen? they are overcome with fear and turned back; their men of war are broken and have gone in flight, not looking back: fear is on every side, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR46_6' data-id='JR46_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let not the quick-footed go in flight, or the man of war get away; on the north, by the river Euphrates, they are slipping and falling. </span>
<span class='v JR46_7' data-id='JR46_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who is this coming up like the Nile, whose waters are lifting their heads like the rivers? </span>
<span class='v JR46_8' data-id='JR46_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Egypt is coming up like the Nile, and his waters are lifting their heads like the rivers, and he says, I will go up, covering the earth; I will send destruction on the town and its people. </span>
<span class='v JR46_9' data-id='JR46_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Go up, you horses; go rushing on, you carriages of war; go out, you men of war: Cush and Put, gripping the body-cover, and the Ludim, with bent bows. </span>
<span class='v JR46_10' data-id='JR46_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But that day is the day of the Lord, the Lord of armies, a day of punishment when he will take payment from his haters: and the sword will have all its desire, drinking their blood in full measure: for there is an offering to the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the north country by the river Euphrates. </span>
<span class='v JR46_11' data-id='JR46_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Go up to Gilead and take sweet oil, O virgin daughter of Egypt: there is no help in all your medical arts; nothing will make you well. </span>
<span class='v JR46_12' data-id='JR46_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Your shame has come to the ears of the nations, and the earth is full of your cry: for the strong man is falling against the strong, they have come down together. </span>
<span class='v JR46_13' data-id='JR46_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The word which the Lord said to Jeremiah the prophet, of how Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, would come and make war on the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v JR46_14' data-id='JR46_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Give the news in Migdol, make it public in Noph: say, Take up your positions and make yourselves ready; for on every side of you the sword has made destruction. </span>
<span class='v JR46_15' data-id='JR46_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Why has Apis, your strong one, gone in flight? he was not able to keep his place, because the Lord was forcing him down with strength. </span>
<span class='v JR46_16' data-id='JR46_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> ... are stopped in their going, they are falling; and they say one to another, Let us get up and go back to our people, to the land of our birth, away from the cruel sword. </span>
<span class='v JR46_17' data-id='JR46_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Give a name to Pharaoh, king of Egypt: A noise who has let the time go by. </span>
<span class='v JR46_18' data-id='JR46_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>By my life, says the King, whose name is the Lord of armies, truly, like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea, so will he come. </span>
<span class='v JR46_19' data-id='JR46_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>O daughter living in Egypt, make ready the vessels of a prisoner: for Noph will become a waste, it will be burned up and become unpeopled. </span>
<span class='v JR46_20' data-id='JR46_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Egypt is a fair young cow; but a biting insect has come on her out of the north. </span>
<span class='v JR46_21' data-id='JR46_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And those who were her fighters for payment are like fat oxen; for they are turned back, they have gone in flight together, they do not keep their place: for the day of their fate has come on them, the time of their punishment. </span>
<span class='v JR46_22' data-id='JR46_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>She makes a sound like the hiss of a snake when they come on with strength; they go against her with axes, like wood-cutters. </span>
<span class='v JR46_23' data-id='JR46_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They will be cutting down her woods, for they may not be searched out; because they are like locusts, more than may be numbered. </span>
<span class='v JR46_24' data-id='JR46_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame; she will be given up into the hands of the people of the north. </span>

<span class='v JR46_26' data-id='JR46_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I will give them up into the hands of those who will take their lives, and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, and into the hands of his servants: and later, it will be peopled as in the past, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR46_27' data-id='JR46_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, and do not be troubled, O Israel: for see, I will make you come back from far away, and your seed from the land where they are prisoners; and Jacob will come back, and will be quiet and in peace, and no one will give him cause for fear. </span>
<span class='v JR46_28' data-id='JR46_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Have no fear, O Jacob, my servant, says the Lord; for I am with you: for I will put an end to all the nations where I have sent you, but I will not put an end to you completely: though with wise purpose I will put right your errors, and will not let you go quite without punishment. </span></div></div>
