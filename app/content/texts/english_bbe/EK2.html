<span class='v EK2_1' data-id='EK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, get up on your feet, so that I may say words to you. </span>
<span class='v EK2_2' data-id='EK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And at his words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and his voice came to my ears. </span>
<span class='v EK2_3' data-id='EK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, I am sending you to the children of Israel, to an uncontrolled nation which has gone against me: they and their fathers have been sinners against me even to this very day. </span>
<span class='v EK2_4' data-id='EK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the children are hard and stiff-hearted; I am sending you to them: and you are to say to them, These are the words of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK2_5' data-id='EK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they, if they give ear to you or if they do not give ear (for they are an uncontrolled people), will see that there has been a prophet among them. </span>
<span class='v EK2_6' data-id='EK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you, son of man, have no fear of them or of their words, even if sharp thorns are round you and you are living among scorpions: have no fear of their words and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people. </span>
<span class='v EK2_7' data-id='EK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And you are to give them my words, if they give ear to you or if they do not: for they are uncontrolled. </span>
<span class='v EK2_8' data-id='EK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But you, son of man, give ear to what I say to you, and do not be uncontrolled like that uncontrolled people: let your mouth be open and take what I give you. </span>
<span class='v EK2_9' data-id='EK2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And looking, I saw a hand stretched out to me, and I saw the roll of a book in it; </span>
<span class='v EK2_10' data-id='EK2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he put it open before me, and it had writing on the front and on the back; words of grief and sorrow and trouble were recorded in it. </span></div></div>
