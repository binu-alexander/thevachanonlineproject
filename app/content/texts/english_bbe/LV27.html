<span class='v LV27_3' data-id='LV27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And you will put the value of a male from twenty years to sixty years old at fifty shekels of silver, by the scale of the holy place. </span>

<span class='v LV27_8' data-id='LV27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But if he is poorer than the value which you have put on him, then let him be taken to the priest, and the priest will put a value on him, such as it is possible for him to give. </span>
<span class='v LV27_9' data-id='LV27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And if it is a beast of which men make offerings to the Lord, whatever any man gives of such to the Lord will be holy. </span>
<span class='v LV27_10' data-id='LV27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>It may not be changed in any way, a good given for a bad, or a bad for a good; if one beast is changed for another, the two will be holy. </span>
<span class='v LV27_11' data-id='LV27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And if it is any unclean beast, of which offerings are not made to the Lord, then let him take the beast before the priest; </span>
<span class='v LV27_12' data-id='LV27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And let the priest put a value on it, if it is good or bad; whatever value the priest puts on it, so will it be. </span>

<span class='v LV27_21' data-id='LV27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But the field, when it becomes free at the year of Jubilee, will be holy to the Lord, as a field given under oath: it will be the property of the priest. </span>
<span class='v LV27_22' data-id='LV27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And if a man gives to the Lord a field which he has got for money from another, which is not part of his heritage; </span>
<span class='v LV27_23' data-id='LV27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then the value fixed by you up to the year of Jubilee will be worked out for him by the priest, and in that day he will give the amount of your value as holy to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV27_24' data-id='LV27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>In the year of Jubilee the field will go back to him from whom he got it, that is, to him whose heritage it was. </span>

<span class='v LV27_27' data-id='LV27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And if it is an unclean beast, then the owner of it may give money to get it back, in agreement with the value fixed by you, by giving a fifth more; or if it is not taken back, let it be given for money in agreement with your valuing. </span>
<span class='v LV27_28' data-id='LV27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But nothing which a man has given completely to the Lord, out of all his property, of man or beast, or of the land which is his heritage, may be given away or got back in exchange for money; anything completely given is most holy to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV27_29' data-id='LV27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Any man given completely to the Lord may not be got back: he is certainly to be put to death. </span>

<span class='v LV27_34' data-id='LV27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>These are the orders which the Lord gave to Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai. </span></div></div>
