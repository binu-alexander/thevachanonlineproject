<span class='v LV13_2' data-id='LV13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If a man has on his skin a growth or a mark or a white place, and it becomes the disease of a leper, let him be taken to Aaron the priest, or to one of the priests, his sons; </span>
<span class='v LV13_3' data-id='LV13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And if, when the priest sees the mark on his skin, the hair on the place is turned white and the mark seems to go deeper than the skin, it is the mark of a leper: and the priest, after looking at him, will say that he is unclean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_4' data-id='LV13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But if the mark on his skin is white, and does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and the hair on it is not turned white, then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days; </span>
<span class='v LV13_5' data-id='LV13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to see him on the seventh day; and if, in his opinion, the place on his skin has not become worse and is not increased in size, then the priest will keep him shut up for seven days more: </span>
<span class='v LV13_6' data-id='LV13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; and if the mark is less bright and is not increased on his skin, then let the priest say that he is clean: it is only a skin-mark, and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_7' data-id='LV13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But if the size of the mark on his skin is increased after he has been seen by the priest, let him go to the priest again: </span>
<span class='v LV13_8' data-id='LV13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And if, after looking at him, he sees that the mark is increased in his skin, let the priest say that he is unclean; he is a leper. </span>
<span class='v LV13_9' data-id='LV13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When the disease of a leper is seen on a man, let him be taken to the priest; </span>
<span class='v LV13_10' data-id='LV13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And if the priest sees that there is a white growth on the skin, and the hair is turned white, and there is diseased flesh in the growth, </span>
<span class='v LV13_11' data-id='LV13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>It is an old disease in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will say that he is unclean; he will not have to be shut up, for he is clearly unclean. </span>

<span class='v LV13_21' data-id='LV13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But if, after looking at it, he sees that there are no white hairs on it, and it is not deeper than the skin, and it is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days: </span>
<span class='v LV13_22' data-id='LV13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And if it is increasing on the skin, the priest will say that he is unclean: it is a disease. </span>

<span class='v LV13_26' data-id='LV13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But if, after looking at it, the priest sees that there is no white hair on the bright place, and it is not deeper than the skin, and is not very bright, then let the priest keep him shut up for seven days: </span>
<span class='v LV13_27' data-id='LV13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to see him again on the seventh day; if it is increased in the skin, then the priest will say that he is unclean: it is the leper's disease. </span>
<span class='v LV13_28' data-id='LV13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And if the bright place keeps the same size and gets no greater on the skin, but is less bright, it is the effect of the burn, and the priest will say that he is clean: it is the mark of the burn. </span>
<span class='v LV13_29' data-id='LV13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And when a man or a woman has a disease on the head, or in the hair of the chin, </span>

<span class='v LV13_31' data-id='LV13_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And after looking at the diseased place, if it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will have him shut up for seven days: </span>
<span class='v LV13_32' data-id='LV13_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and there is no yellow hair in it, and it does not seem to go deeper than the skin, </span>
<span class='v LV13_33' data-id='LV13_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then his hair is to be cut off, but not on the diseased place, and he is to be shut up for seven days more: </span>
<span class='v LV13_34' data-id='LV13_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day the priest will see the place: and if it is not increased, and does not seem to go deeper than the skin, the priest will say that he is clean: and after his clothing has been washed he will be clean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_35' data-id='LV13_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But if the disease in his skin becomes worse after he has been made clean, </span>
<span class='v LV13_36' data-id='LV13_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then the priest is to see him: and if the mark is increased, the priest, without looking for the yellow hair, will say that he is unclean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_37' data-id='LV13_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But if, in his opinion, the growth is stopped, and black hair has come up on it, the disease has gone; he is clean and the priest will say that he is clean. </span>

<span class='v LV13_39' data-id='LV13_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then the priest is to see them: and if the white marks on their skin are not very bright, it is a skin disease which has come out on the skin; he is clean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_40' data-id='LV13_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And if a man's hair has come out and he has no hair, still he is clean. </span>

<span class='v LV13_44' data-id='LV13_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>He is a leper and unclean; the priest is to say that he is most certainly unclean: the disease is in his head. </span>

<span class='v LV13_51' data-id='LV13_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>And he is to see the mark on the seventh day; if the mark is increased in the clothing, or in the threads of the material, or in the leather, whatever the leather is used for, it is the disease biting into it: it is unclean. </span>
<span class='v LV13_52' data-id='LV13_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And the clothing, or the wool or linen material, or anything of leather in which is the disease, is to be burned: for the disease is biting into it; let it be burned in the fire. </span>
<span class='v LV13_53' data-id='LV13_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And if the priest sees that the mark is not increased in the clothing or in any part of the material or in the leather, </span>
<span class='v LV13_54' data-id='LV13_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Then the priest will give orders for the thing on which the mark is, to be washed, and to be shut up for seven days more: </span>
<span class='v LV13_55' data-id='LV13_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>And if, after the mark has been washed, the priest sees that the colour of it is not changed and it is not increased, it is to be burned in the fire: the disease is working in it, though the damage may be inside or outside. </span>
<span class='v LV13_56' data-id='LV13_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And if the priest sees that the mark is less bright after the washing, then let him have it cut out of the clothing or the leather or from the threads of the material: </span>
