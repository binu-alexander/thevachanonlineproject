<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS47_1' data-id='IS47_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Come and take your seat in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; come down from your seat of power, and take your place on the earth, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will never again seem soft and delicate. </span>
<span class='v IS47_2' data-id='IS47_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Take the crushing-stones and get the meal crushed: take off your veil, put away your robe, let your legs be uncovered, go through the rivers. </span>
<span class='v IS47_3' data-id='IS47_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The shame of your unclothed condition will be seen by all: I will give punishment without mercy, </span>
<span class='v IS47_4' data-id='IS47_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Says the Lord who takes up our cause; the Lord of armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel. </span>
<span class='v IS47_5' data-id='IS47_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Be seated in the dark without a word, O daughter of the Chaldaeans: for you will no longer be named, The Queen of Kingdoms. </span>
<span class='v IS47_6' data-id='IS47_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I was angry with my people, I put shame on my heritage, and gave them into your hands: you had no mercy on them; you put a cruel yoke on those who were old; </span>
<span class='v IS47_7' data-id='IS47_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And you said, I will be a queen for ever: you did not give attention to these things, and did not keep in mind what would come after. </span>
<span class='v IS47_8' data-id='IS47_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So now take note of this, you who are given up to pleasure, living without fear of evil, saying in your heart, I am, and there is no one like me; I will never be a widow, or have my children taken from me. </span>
<span class='v IS47_9' data-id='IS47_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day, the loss of children and of husband: in full measure they will come on you, for all your secret arts, and all your wonders. </span>
<span class='v IS47_10' data-id='IS47_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For you had faith in your evil-doing; you said, No one sees me; by your wisdom and knowledge you have been turned out of the way: and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is no other. </span>
<span class='v IS47_11' data-id='IS47_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Because of this evil will come on you, which may not be turned away for any price: and trouble will overtake you, from which no money will give salvation: destruction will come on you suddenly, without your knowledge. </span>
<span class='v IS47_12' data-id='IS47_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Go on now with your secret arts, and all your wonder-working, to which you have given yourself up from your earliest days; it may be that they will be of profit to you, or by them you may put fear into your attackers. </span>
<span class='v IS47_13' data-id='IS47_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But your mind is troubled by the number of your guides: let them now come forward for your salvation: the measurers of the heavens, the watchers of the stars, and those who are able to say from month to month what things are coming on you. </span>
<span class='v IS47_14' data-id='IS47_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Truly, they have become like dry stems, they have been burned in the fire; they are not able to keep themselves safe from the power of the flame: it is not a coal for warming them, or a fire by which a man may be seated. </span>
<span class='v IS47_15' data-id='IS47_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Small profit have you had from those who, from your earliest days, got great profit out of you; they have gone in flight, every one straight before him, and you have no saviour. </span></div></div>
