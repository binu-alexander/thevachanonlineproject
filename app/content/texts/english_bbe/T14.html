<span class='v T14_1' data-id='T14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But the Spirit says clearly that in later times some will be turned away from the faith, giving their minds to spirits of deceit, and the teachings of evil spirits, </span>
<span class='v T14_2' data-id='T14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Through the false ways of men whose words are untrue, whose hearts are burned as with a heated iron; </span>
<span class='v T14_3' data-id='T14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Who keep men from being married and from taking food which God made to be taken with praise by those who have faith and true knowledge. </span>
<span class='v T14_4' data-id='T14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because everything which God has made is good, and nothing is evil, if it is taken with praise: </span>
<span class='v T14_5' data-id='T14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For it is made holy by the word of God and by prayer. </span>
<span class='v T14_6' data-id='T14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If you keep these things before the minds of the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, trained in the words of the faith and of the right teaching which has been your guide: </span>
<span class='v T14_7' data-id='T14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But have nothing to do with unclean and foolish stories. Give yourself training in religion: </span>
<span class='v T14_8' data-id='T14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the training of the body is of profit for a little, but religion is of profit in every way, giving hope for the life which now is, and for that which is to come. </span>
<span class='v T14_9' data-id='T14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>This is a true saying, in which all may put their faith. </span>
<span class='v T14_10' data-id='T14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And this is the purpose of all our work and our fighting, because our hope is in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, and specially of those who have faith. </span>
<span class='v T14_11' data-id='T14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let these be your orders and your teaching. </span>
<span class='v T14_12' data-id='T14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let no one make little of you because you are young, but be an example to the church in word, in behaviour, in love, in faith, in holy living. </span>
<span class='v T14_13' data-id='T14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Till I come, give attention to the reading of the holy Writings, to comforting the saints, and to teaching. </span>
<span class='v T14_14' data-id='T14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Make use of that grace in you, which was given to you by the word of the prophets, when the rulers of the church put their hands on you. </span>
<span class='v T14_15' data-id='T14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Have a care for these things; give yourself to them with all your heart, so that all may see how you go forward. </span>
<span class='v T14_16' data-id='T14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Give attention to yourself and your teaching. Go on in these things; for in doing so you will get salvation for yourself and for those who give hearing to you. </span></div></div>
