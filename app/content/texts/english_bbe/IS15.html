<span class='v IS15_1' data-id='IS15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word about Moab. For in a night Ar of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer; for in a night Kir of Moab has become waste, and is seen no longer. </span>
<span class='v IS15_2' data-id='IS15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The daughter of Dibon has gone up to the high places, weeping: Moab is sounding her cry of sorrow over Nebo, and over Medeba: everywhere the hair of the head and of the face is cut off. </span>
<span class='v IS15_3' data-id='IS15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In their streets they are covering themselves with haircloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their public places, there is crying and bitter weeping. </span>
<span class='v IS15_4' data-id='IS15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Heshbon is crying out, and Elealeh; their voice is sounding even to Jahaz: for this cause the heart of Moab is shaking; his soul is shaking with fear. </span>
<span class='v IS15_5' data-id='IS15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My heart is crying out for Moab; her people go in flight to Zoar, and to Eglath-shelishiyah: for they go up with weeping by the slope of Luhith; on the way to Horonaim they send up a cry of destruction. </span>
<span class='v IS15_6' data-id='IS15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The waters of Nimrim will become dry: for the grass is burned up, the young grass is coming to an end, every green thing is dead. </span>
<span class='v IS15_7' data-id='IS15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For this cause they will take away their wealth, and the stores they have got together, over the stream of the water-plants. </span>
<span class='v IS15_8' data-id='IS15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the cry has gone round the limits of Moab; as far as to Eglaim and Beer-elim. </span>
<span class='v IS15_9' data-id='IS15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For the waters of Dimon are full of blood: and I'm sending even more on Moab, a lion on those of Moab who go in flight, and on the rest of the land. </span></div></div>
