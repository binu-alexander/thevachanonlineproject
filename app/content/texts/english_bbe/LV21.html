<span class='v LV21_3' data-id='LV21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And for his sister, a virgin, for she is his near relation and has had no husband, he may make himself unclean. </span>
<span class='v LV21_4' data-id='LV21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But let him, being a chief among his people, not make himself unclean in such a way as to put shame on himself. </span>
<span class='v LV21_5' data-id='LV21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They are not to have their hair cut off for the dead, or the hair on their chins cut short, or make cuts in their flesh. </span>
<span class='v LV21_6' data-id='LV21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let them be holy to their God and not make the name of their God common; for the fire offerings of the Lord and the bread of their God are offered by them, and they are to be holy. </span>
<span class='v LV21_7' data-id='LV21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They may not take as wife a loose or common woman, or one who has been put away by her husband: for the priest is holy to his God. </span>
<span class='v LV21_8' data-id='LV21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he is to be holy in your eyes, for by him the bread of your God is offered; he is to be holy in your eyes, for I the Lord, who make you holy, am holy. </span>

<span class='v LV21_18' data-id='LV21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For any man whose body is damaged may not come near: one who is blind, or has not the use of his legs, or one who has a broken nose or any unnatural growth, </span>

<span class='v LV21_21' data-id='LV21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>No man of the offspring of Aaron whose body is damaged in any way may come near to give the fire offerings of the Lord: he is damaged, he may not come near to make the offerings. </span>
<span class='v LV21_22' data-id='LV21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He may take of the bread of God, the holy and the most holy; </span>
<span class='v LV21_23' data-id='LV21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he may not go inside the veil or come near the altar, because he is damaged; and he may not make my holy places common; for I the Lord have made them holy. </span>
