<span class='v JB21_1' data-id='JB21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB21_2' data-id='JB21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give attention with care to my words; and let this be your comfort. </span>
<span class='v JB21_3' data-id='JB21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let me say what is in my mind, and after that, go on making sport of me. </span>
<span class='v JB21_4' data-id='JB21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As for me, is my outcry against man? is it then to be wondered at if my spirit is troubled? </span>
<span class='v JB21_5' data-id='JB21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Take note of me and be full of wonder, put your hand on your mouth. </span>
<span class='v JB21_6' data-id='JB21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>At the very thought of it my flesh is shaking with fear. </span>
<span class='v JB21_7' data-id='JB21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Why is life given to the evil-doers? why do they become old and strong in power? </span>
<span class='v JB21_8' data-id='JB21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Their children are ever with them, and their offspring before their eyes. </span>
<span class='v JB21_9' data-id='JB21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Their houses are free from fear, and the rod of God does not come on them. </span>
<span class='v JB21_10' data-id='JB21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Their ox is ready at all times to give seed; their cow gives birth, without dropping her young. </span>
<span class='v JB21_11' data-id='JB21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They send out their young ones like a flock, and their children have pleasure in the dance, </span>
<span class='v JB21_12' data-id='JB21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They make songs to the instruments of music, and are glad at the sound of the pipe. </span>
<span class='v JB21_13' data-id='JB21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Their days come to an end without trouble, and suddenly they go down to the underworld. </span>
<span class='v JB21_14' data-id='JB21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Though they said to God, Go away from us, for we have no desire for the knowledge of your ways. </span>
<span class='v JB21_15' data-id='JB21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What is the Ruler of all, that we may give him worship? and what profit is it to us to make prayer to him? </span>
<span class='v JB21_16' data-id='JB21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Truly, is not their well-being in their power? (The purpose of the evil-doers is far from me.) </span>
<span class='v JB21_17' data-id='JB21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>How frequently is the light of the evil-doers put out, or does trouble come on them? how frequently does his wrath take them with cords? </span>
<span class='v JB21_18' data-id='JB21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>How frequently are they as dry stems before the wind, or as grass taken away by the storm-wind? </span>
<span class='v JB21_19' data-id='JB21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You say, God keeps punishment stored up for his children. Let him send it on the man himself, so that he may have the punishment of it! </span>
<span class='v JB21_20' data-id='JB21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Let his eyes see his trouble, and let him be full of the wrath of the Ruler of all! </span>
<span class='v JB21_21' data-id='JB21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For what interest has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is ended? </span>
<span class='v JB21_22' data-id='JB21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Is anyone able to give teaching to God? for he is the judge of those who are on high. </span>
<span class='v JB21_23' data-id='JB21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>One comes to his end in complete well-being, full of peace and quiet: </span>
<span class='v JB21_24' data-id='JB21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>His buckets are full of milk, and there is no loss of strength in his bones. </span>
<span class='v JB21_25' data-id='JB21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And another comes to his end with a bitter soul, without ever tasting good. </span>
<span class='v JB21_26' data-id='JB21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Together they go down to the dust, and are covered by the worm. </span>
<span class='v JB21_27' data-id='JB21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>See, I am conscious of your thoughts, and of your violent purposes against me; </span>
<span class='v JB21_28' data-id='JB21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For you say, Where is the house of the ruler, and where is the tent of the evil-doer? </span>
<span class='v JB21_29' data-id='JB21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Have you not put the question to the travellers, and do you not take note of their experience? </span>
<span class='v JB21_30' data-id='JB21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>How the evil man goes free in the day of trouble, and has salvation in the day of wrath? </span>
<span class='v JB21_31' data-id='JB21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Who will make his way clear to his face? and if he has done a thing, who gives him punishment for it? </span>
<span class='v JB21_32' data-id='JB21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He is taken to his last resting-place, and keeps watch over it. </span>
<span class='v JB21_33' data-id='JB21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The earth of the valley covering his bones is sweet to him, and all men come after him, as there were unnumbered before him. </span>
<span class='v JB21_34' data-id='JB21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Why then do you give me comfort with words in which there is no profit, when you see that there is nothing in your answers but deceit? </span></div></div>
