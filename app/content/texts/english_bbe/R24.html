<span class='v R24_1' data-id='R24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then he made a brass altar, twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high. </span>
<span class='v R24_2' data-id='R24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he made the great water-vessel of metal, round in form, measuring ten cubits across from edge to edge; it was five cubits high and thirty cubits round. </span>
<span class='v R24_3' data-id='R24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And under it was a design of flowers all round it, ten to a cubit, circling the water-vessel in two lines; they were made from liquid metal at the same time as the water-vessel. </span>
<span class='v R24_4' data-id='R24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It was supported on twelve oxen, three facing to the north, three to the west, three to the south, and three to the east, the water-vessel resting on top of them; their back parts were all turned to the middle of it. </span>
<span class='v R24_5' data-id='R24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It was as thick as a man's open hand, and the edge of it was curved like the edge of a cup, like a lily flower; it would take three thousand baths. </span>
<span class='v R24_6' data-id='R24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he made ten washing-vessels, putting five on the right side and five on the left; such things as were used in making the burned offering were washed in them; but the great water-vessel was to be used by the priests for washing themselves. </span>
<span class='v R24_7' data-id='R24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he made the ten gold supports for the lights, as directions had been given for them, and he put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. </span>
<span class='v R24_8' data-id='R24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He made ten tables, and put them in the Temple, five on the right side and five on the left. And he made a hundred gold basins. </span>
<span class='v R24_9' data-id='R24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he made the open space for the priests, and the great open space and its doors, plating the doors with brass. </span>
<span class='v R24_10' data-id='R24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He put the great water-vessel on the right side of the house to the east, facing south. </span>
<span class='v R24_11' data-id='R24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Huram made all the pots and the spades and the basins. So he came to the end of all the work he did for King Solomon in the house of God: </span>
<span class='v R24_12' data-id='R24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The two pillars, and the two crowns on the tops of the pillars, and the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the tops of the pillars; </span>
<span class='v R24_13' data-id='R24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the four hundred apples for the network, two lines of apples for the network covering the two cups of the crowns on the pillars. </span>
<span class='v R24_14' data-id='R24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he made the ten bases and the ten washing-vessels which were on the bases; </span>
<span class='v R24_15' data-id='R24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The great water-vessel with the twelve oxen under it. </span>
<span class='v R24_16' data-id='R24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>All the pots and the spades and the meat-hooks and their vessels, which Huram, who was as his father, made for King Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of polished brass. </span>
<span class='v R24_17' data-id='R24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The king made them of liquid metal in the lowland of Jordan, in the soft earth between Succoth and Zeredah. </span>
<span class='v R24_18' data-id='R24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Solomon made all these vessels, a very great store of them, and the weight of the brass used was not measured. </span>
<span class='v R24_19' data-id='R24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And Solomon made all the vessels used in the house of God, the gold altar and the tables on which the holy bread was placed, </span>
<span class='v R24_20' data-id='R24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the supports for the lights with their lights, to be burning in the regular way in front of the inmost room, of the best gold; </span>
<span class='v R24_21' data-id='R24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The flowers and the vessels for the lights and the instruments used for them, were all of gold; it was the best gold. </span>
<span class='v R24_22' data-id='R24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The scissors and the basins and the spoons and the fire-trays, of the best gold; and the inner doors of the house, opening into the most holy place, and the doors of the Temple, were all of gold. </span></div></div>
