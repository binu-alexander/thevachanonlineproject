<span class='v ER8_15' data-id='ER8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And I made them come together by the river flowing to Ahava; and we were there in tents for three days: and after viewing the people and the priests I saw that no sons of Levi were there. </span>
<span class='v ER8_16' data-id='ER8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then I sent for Eliezer and Ariel and Shemaiah and Elnathan Jarib and Elnathan and Nathan and Zechariah and Meshullam, all responsible men; and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise men. </span>
<span class='v ER8_17' data-id='ER8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And I sent them to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and gave them orders what to say to Iddo and his brothers the Nethinim at the place Casiphia, so that they might come back to us with men to do the work of the house of our God. </span>
<span class='v ER8_18' data-id='ER8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And by the help of our God they got for us Ish-sechel, one of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah with his sons and brothers, eighteen; </span>
<span class='v ER8_19' data-id='ER8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty; </span>
<span class='v ER8_20' data-id='ER8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And of the Nethinim, to whom David and the captains had given the work of helping the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim, all of them specially named. </span>
<span class='v ER8_21' data-id='ER8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I gave orders for a time of going without food, there by the river Ahava, so that we might make ourselves low before our God in prayer, requesting from him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance. </span>
<span class='v ER8_22' data-id='ER8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For I would not, for shame, make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might make attacks on us on the way: for we had said to the king, The hand of our God is on his servants for good, but his power and his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him. </span>
<span class='v ER8_23' data-id='ER8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So we went without food, requesting our God for this: and his ear was open to our prayer. </span>
<span class='v ER8_24' data-id='ER8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So I put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them, </span>
<span class='v ER8_25' data-id='ER8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, all the offering for the house of our God which the king and his wise men and his captains and all Israel there present had given: </span>
<span class='v ER8_26' data-id='ER8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels, a hundred talents' weight, and a hundred talents of gold, </span>
<span class='v ER8_27' data-id='ER8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And twenty gold basins, of a thousand darics, and two vessels of the best bright brass, equal in value to gold. </span>
<span class='v ER8_28' data-id='ER8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And I said to them, You are holy to the Lord and the vessels are holy: and the silver and the gold are an offering freely given to the Lord, the God of your fathers. </span>
<span class='v ER8_29' data-id='ER8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Take care of them and keep them, till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the rooms of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v ER8_30' data-id='ER8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites took the weight of silver and gold and the vessels, to take them to Jerusalem into the house of our God. </span>
<span class='v ER8_31' data-id='ER8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then we went away from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was on us, and he gave us salvation from our haters and those who were waiting to make an attack on us by the way. </span>
<span class='v ER8_32' data-id='ER8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And we came to Jerusalem and were there for three days. </span>
<span class='v ER8_33' data-id='ER8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And on the fourth day, the silver and the gold and the vessels were measured out by weight in the house of our God into the hands of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest; and with him was Eleazar, the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad, the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui, the Levites; </span>
<span class='v ER8_34' data-id='ER8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>All was handed over by number and by weight: and the weight was put on record at that time. </span>
<span class='v ER8_35' data-id='ER8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And those who had been prisoners, who had come back from a strange land, made burned offerings to the God of Israel, twelve oxen for all Israel, ninety-six male sheep, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all this was a burned offering to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v ER8_36' data-id='ER8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And they gave the king's orders to the king's captains and the rulers across the river, and they gave the people and the house of God the help which was needed. </span></div></div>
