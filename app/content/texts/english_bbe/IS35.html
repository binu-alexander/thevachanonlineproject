<span class='v IS35_1' data-id='IS35_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The waste land and the dry places will be glad; the lowland will have joy and be full of flowers. </span>
<span class='v IS35_2' data-id='IS35_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It will be flowering like the rose; it will be full of delight and songs; the glory of Lebanon will be given to it; the pride of Carmel and Sharon: they will see the glory of the Lord, the power of our God. </span>
<span class='v IS35_3' data-id='IS35_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Make strong the feeble hands, give support to the shaking knees. </span>
<span class='v IS35_4' data-id='IS35_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Say to those who are full of fear, Be strong and take heart: see, your God will give punishment; the reward of God will come; he himself will come to be your saviour. </span>
<span class='v IS35_5' data-id='IS35_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the eyes of the blind will see, and the ears which are stopped will be open. </span>
<span class='v IS35_6' data-id='IS35_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then will the feeble-footed be jumping like a roe, and the voice which was stopped will be loud in song: for in the waste land streams will be bursting out, and waters in the dry places. </span>
<span class='v IS35_7' data-id='IS35_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the burning sand will become a pool, and the dry earth springs of waters: the fields where the sheep take their food will become wet land, and water-plants will take the place of grass. </span>
<span class='v IS35_8' data-id='IS35_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And a highway will be there; its name will be, The Holy Way; the unclean and the sinner may not go over it, and those who go on it will not be turned out of the way by the foolish. </span>
