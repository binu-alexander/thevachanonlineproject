<span class='v JB31_1' data-id='JB31_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I made an agreement with my eyes; how then might my eyes be looking on a virgin? </span>
<span class='v JB31_2' data-id='JB31_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For what is God's reward from on high, or the heritage given by the Ruler of all from heaven? </span>
<span class='v JB31_3' data-id='JB31_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Is it not trouble for the sinner, and destruction for the evil-doers? </span>

<span class='v JB31_5' data-id='JB31_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If I have gone in false ways, or my foot has been quick in working deceit; </span>

<span class='v JB31_7' data-id='JB31_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If my steps have been turned out of the way, or if my heart went after my eyes, or if the property of another is in my hands; </span>
<span class='v JB31_8' data-id='JB31_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let me put seed in the earth for another to have the fruit of it, and let my produce be uprooted. </span>
<span class='v JB31_9' data-id='JB31_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If my heart went after another man's wife, or if I was waiting secretly at my neighbour's door; </span>
<span class='v JB31_10' data-id='JB31_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then let my wife give pleasure to another man and let others make use of her body. </span>
<span class='v JB31_11' data-id='JB31_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For that would be a crime; it would be an act for which punishment would be measured out by the judges: </span>
<span class='v JB31_12' data-id='JB31_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It would be a fire burning even to destruction, and taking away all my produce. </span>
<span class='v JB31_13' data-id='JB31_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If I did wrong in the cause of my man-servant, or my woman-servant, when they went to law with me; </span>

<span class='v JB31_27' data-id='JB31_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A secret feeling of worship came into my heart, and my hand gave kisses from my mouth; </span>
<span class='v JB31_28' data-id='JB31_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>That would have been another sin to be rewarded with punishment by the judges; for I would have been false to God on high. </span>

<span class='v JB31_32' data-id='JB31_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>The traveller did not take his night's rest in the street, and my doors were open to anyone on a journey; </span>
<span class='v JB31_33' data-id='JB31_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>If I kept my evil doings covered, and my sin in the secret of my breast, </span>
<span class='v JB31_34' data-id='JB31_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For fear of the great body of people, or for fear that families might make sport of me, so that I kept quiet, and did not go out of my door; </span>
<span class='v JB31_35' data-id='JB31_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>If only God would give ear to me, and the Ruler of all would give me an answer! or if what he has against me had been put in writing! </span>
<span class='v JB31_36' data-id='JB31_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Truly I would take up the book in my hands; it would be to me as a crown; </span>
<span class='v JB31_37' data-id='JB31_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>I would make clear the number of my steps, I would put it before him like a prince! The words of Job are ended. </span>
<span class='v JB31_38' data-id='JB31_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>If my land has made an outcry against me, or the ploughed earth has been in sorrow; </span>
<span class='v JB31_39' data-id='JB31_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>If I have taken its produce without payment, causing the death of its owners; </span>
<span class='v JB31_40' data-id='JB31_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then in place of grain let thorns come up, and in place of barley evil-smelling plants. </span></div></div>
