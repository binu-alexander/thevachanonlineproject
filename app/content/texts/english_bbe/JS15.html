<span class='v JS15_1' data-id='JS15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the part of the land marked out for the children of Judah by families, went up to the edge of Edom, as far as the waste land of Zin to the south, to the farthest point of it on the south. </span>
<span class='v JS15_2' data-id='JS15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Their south limit was from the farthest part of the Salt Sea, from the inlet looking to the south: </span>
<span class='v JS15_3' data-id='JS15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>From there it goes south of the slope up to Akrabbim, and on to Zin, then south past Kadesh-barnea, and on by Hezron and up to Addar, turning in the direction of Karka: </span>
<span class='v JS15_4' data-id='JS15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then on to Azmon, ending at the stream of Egypt: and the end of the limit is at the sea; this will be your limit on the south. </span>
<span class='v JS15_5' data-id='JS15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the east limit is the Salt Sea as far as the end of Jordan. And the limit of the north part of the land is from the inlet of the sea at the end of Jordan: </span>
<span class='v JS15_6' data-id='JS15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the line goes up to Beth-hoglah, past the north of Beth-arabah, and up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben; </span>
<span class='v JS15_7' data-id='JS15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the line goes up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and so to the north, in the direction of Gilgal, which is opposite the slope up to Adummim, on the south side of the river: and the line goes on to the waters of En-shemesh, ending at En-rogel: </span>
<span class='v JS15_8' data-id='JS15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the line goes up by the valley of the son of Hinnom to the south side of the Jebusite (which is Jerusalem): then up to the top of the mountain in front of the valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the farthest point of the valley of Rephaim on the north: </span>
<span class='v JS15_9' data-id='JS15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the limit is marked out from the top of the mountain to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah, and out to the towns of Mount Ephron, as far as Baalah (which is Kiriath-jearim): </span>
<span class='v JS15_10' data-id='JS15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then turning west, the line goes from Baalah to Mount Seir, and on to the side of Mount Jearim (which is Chesalon) on the north, then down to Beth-shemesh, and on past Timnah: </span>
<span class='v JS15_11' data-id='JS15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And out to the side of Ekron to the north: then it is marked out to Shikkeron and on to Mount Baalah, ending at Jabneel; the end of the line is at the sea. </span>
<span class='v JS15_12' data-id='JS15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the limit on the west is the edge of the Great Sea. This is the line going round the land marked out for the children of Judah, by their families. </span>
<span class='v JS15_13' data-id='JS15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he gave a part among the children of Judah, as the Lord had given orders to Joshua, that is, Kiriath-arba, named after Arba, the father of Anak which is Hebron. </span>
<span class='v JS15_14' data-id='JS15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak, were forced out from there by Caleb. </span>
<span class='v JS15_15' data-id='JS15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>From there he went up against the people of Debir: (now the name of Debir before that was Kiriath-sepher.) </span>
<span class='v JS15_16' data-id='JS15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Caleb said, I will give Achsah, my daughter, as wife to the man who overcomes Kiriath-sepher and takes it. </span>
<span class='v JS15_17' data-id='JS15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's brother, took it: so he gave him his daughter Achsah for his wife. </span>
<span class='v JS15_18' data-id='JS15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now when she came to him, he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father: and she got down from her ass; and Caleb said to her, What is it? </span>
<span class='v JS15_19' data-id='JS15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And she said, Give me a blessing; because you have put me in dry south-land, now give me springs of water. So he gave her the higher spring and the lower spring. </span>
<span class='v JS15_20' data-id='JS15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>This is the heritage of the tribe of Judah, by their families. </span>
