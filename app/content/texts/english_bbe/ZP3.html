<span class='v ZP3_1' data-id='ZP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Sorrow to her who is uncontrolled and unclean, the cruel town! </span>
<span class='v ZP3_2' data-id='ZP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>She gave no attention to the voice, she had no use for teaching, she put no faith in the Lord, she did not come near to her God. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_3' data-id='ZP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Her rulers are like loud-voiced lions in her; her judges are wolves of the evening, crushing up the bones before the morning. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_4' data-id='ZP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Her prophets are good-for-nothing persons, full of deceit: her priests have made the holy place unclean and have gone violently against the law. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_5' data-id='ZP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The Lord in her is upright; he will not do evil; every morning he lets his righteousness be seen, he is unchanging; but the evil-doer has no sense of shame. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_6' data-id='ZP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I have had the nations cut off, their towers are broken down; I have made their streets a waste so that no one goes through them: destruction has overtaken their towns, so that there is no man living in them. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_7' data-id='ZP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I said, Certainly you will go in fear of me, and come under my training, so that whatever I may send on her may not be cut off before her eyes: but they got up early and made all their works evil. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_8' data-id='ZP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For this reason, go on waiting for me, says the Lord, till the day when I come up as a witness: for my purpose is to send for the nations and to get the kingdoms together, so that I may let loose on them my passion, even all my burning wrath: for all the earth will be burned up in the fire of my bitter passion. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_9' data-id='ZP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For then I will give the people a clean language, so that they may all make prayer to the Lord and be his servants with one mind. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_10' data-id='ZP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>From over the rivers of Ethiopia, and from the sides of the north, they will come to me with an offering. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_11' data-id='ZP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In that day you will have no shame on account of all the things in which you did evil against me: for then I will take away from among you those who were lifted up in pride, and you will no longer be lifted up with pride in my holy mountain. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_12' data-id='ZP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But I will still have among you a quiet and poor people, and they will put their faith in the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_13' data-id='ZP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The rest of Israel will do no evil and say no false words; the tongue of deceit will not be seen in their mouth: for they will take their food and their rest, and no one will be a cause of fear to them. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_14' data-id='ZP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Make melody, O daughter of Zion; give a loud cry, O Israel; be glad and let your heart be full of joy, O daughter of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_15' data-id='ZP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Lord has taken away those who were judging you, he has sent your haters far away: the King of Israel, even the Lord, is among you: you will have no more fear of evil. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_16' data-id='ZP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In that day it will be said to Jerusalem, Have no fear: O Zion, let not your hands be feeble. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_17' data-id='ZP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The Lord your God is among you, as a strong saviour: he will be glad over you with joy, he will make his love new again, he will make a song of joy over you as in the time of a holy feast. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_18' data-id='ZP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will take away your troubles, lifting up your shame from off you. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_19' data-id='ZP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>See, at that time I will put an end to all who have been troubling you: I will give salvation to her whose steps are uncertain, and get together her who has been sent in flight; and I will make them a cause of praise and an honoured name in all the earth, when I let their fate be changed. </span>
<span class='v ZP3_20' data-id='ZP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>At that time I will make you come in, at that time I will get you together: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth when I let your fate be changed before your eyes, says the Lord. </span></div></div>
