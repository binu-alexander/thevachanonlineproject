<span class='v MC2_1' data-id='MC2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A curse on the designers of evil, working on their beds! in the morning light they do it, because it is in their power. </span>
<span class='v MC2_2' data-id='MC2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They have a desire for fields and take them by force; and for houses and take them away: they are cruel to a man and his family, even to a man and his heritage. </span>
<span class='v MC2_3' data-id='MC2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this cause the Lord has said, See, against this family I am purposing an evil from which you will not be able to take your necks away, and you will be weighted down by it; for it is an evil time. </span>
<span class='v MC2_4' data-id='MC2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In that day this saying will be said about you, and this song of grief will be made: The heritage of my people is measured out, and there is no one to give it back; those who have made us prisoners have taken our fields from us, and complete destruction has come to us. </span>
<span class='v MC2_5' data-id='MC2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this cause you will have no one to make the decision by the measuring line in the meeting of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v MC2_6' data-id='MC2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let not words like these be dropped, they say: Shame and the curse will not come to the family of Jacob! </span>
<span class='v MC2_7' data-id='MC2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Is the Lord quickly made angry? are these his doings? do not his words do good to his people Israel? </span>
<span class='v MC2_8' data-id='MC2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As for you, you have become haters of those who were at peace with you: you take the clothing of those who go by without fear, and make them prisoners of war. </span>
<span class='v MC2_9' data-id='MC2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The women of my people you have been driving away from their dearly loved children; from their young ones you are taking my glory for ever. </span>
<span class='v MC2_10' data-id='MC2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Up! and go; for this is not your rest: because it has been made unclean, the destruction ordered will come on you. </span>
<span class='v MC2_11' data-id='MC2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If a man came with a false spirit of deceit, saying, I will be a prophet to you of wine and strong drink: he would be the sort of prophet for this people. </span>
<span class='v MC2_12' data-id='MC2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I will certainly make all of you, O Jacob, come together; I will get together the rest of Israel; I will put them together like the sheep in their circle: like a flock in their green field; they will be full of the noise of men. </span>
<span class='v MC2_13' data-id='MC2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The opener of the way will go up before them: forcing their way out they will go on to the doorway and out through it: their king will go on before them, and the Lord at their head. </span></div></div>
