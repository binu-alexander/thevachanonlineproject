<span class='v MT5_1' data-id='MT5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And seeing great masses of people he went up into the mountain; and when he was seated his disciples came to him. </span>
<span class='v MT5_2' data-id='MT5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And with these words he gave them teaching, saying, </span>
<span class='v MT5_3' data-id='MT5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Happy are the poor in spirit: for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. </span>
<span class='v MT5_4' data-id='MT5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Happy are those who are sad: for they will be comforted. </span>
<span class='v MT5_5' data-id='MT5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Happy are the gentle: for the earth will be their heritage. </span>
<span class='v MT5_6' data-id='MT5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Happy are those whose heart's desire is for righteousness: for they will have their desire. </span>
<span class='v MT5_7' data-id='MT5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Happy are those who have mercy: for they will be given mercy. </span>
<span class='v MT5_8' data-id='MT5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Happy are the clean in heart: for they will see God. </span>
<span class='v MT5_9' data-id='MT5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Happy are the peacemakers: for they will be named sons of God. </span>
<span class='v MT5_10' data-id='MT5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Happy are those who are attacked on account of righteousness: for the kingdom of heaven will be theirs. </span>
<span class='v MT5_11' data-id='MT5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Happy are you when men give you a bad name, and are cruel to you, and say all evil things against you falsely, because of me. </span>
<span class='v MT5_12' data-id='MT5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Be glad and full of joy; for great is your reward in heaven: for so were the prophets attacked who were before you. </span>
<span class='v MT5_13' data-id='MT5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You are the salt of the earth; but if its taste goes from the salt, how will you make it salt again? it is then good for nothing but to be put out and crushed under foot by men. </span>
<span class='v MT5_14' data-id='MT5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You are the light of the world. A town put on a hill may be seen by all. </span>
<span class='v MT5_15' data-id='MT5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And a burning light is not put under a vessel, but on its table; so that its rays may be shining on all who are in the house. </span>
<span class='v MT5_16' data-id='MT5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Even so let your light be shining before men, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT5_17' data-id='MT5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let there be no thought that I have come to put an end to the law or the prophets. I have not come for destruction, but to make complete. </span>
<span class='v MT5_18' data-id='MT5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Truly I say to you, Till heaven and earth come to an end, not the smallest letter or part of a letter will in any way be taken from the law, till all things are done. </span>
<span class='v MT5_19' data-id='MT5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Whoever then goes against the smallest of these laws, teaching men to do the same, will be named least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who keeps the laws, teaching others to keep them, will be named great in the kingdom of heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT5_20' data-id='MT5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For I say to you, If your righteousness is not greater than the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT5_21' data-id='MT5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You have knowledge that it was said in old times, You may not put to death; and, Whoever puts to death will be in danger of being judged: </span>
<span class='v MT5_22' data-id='MT5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be in danger of being judged; and he who says to his brother, Raca, will be in danger from the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, You foolish one, will be in danger of the hell of fire. </span>
<span class='v MT5_23' data-id='MT5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If then you are making an offering at the altar and there it comes to your mind that your brother has something against you, </span>
<span class='v MT5_24' data-id='MT5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>While your offering is still before the altar, first go and make peace with your brother, then come and make your offering. </span>
<span class='v MT5_25' data-id='MT5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Come to an agreement quickly with him who has a cause against you at law, while you are with him on the way, for fear that he may give you up to the judge and the judge may give you to the police and you may be put into prison. </span>
<span class='v MT5_26' data-id='MT5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Truly I say to you, You will not come out from there till you have made payment of the very last farthing. </span>
<span class='v MT5_27' data-id='MT5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>You have knowledge that it was said, You may not have connection with another man's wife: </span>
<span class='v MT5_28' data-id='MT5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that everyone whose eyes are turned on a woman with desire has had connection with her in his heart. </span>
<span class='v MT5_29' data-id='MT5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And if your right eye is a cause of trouble to you, take it out and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell. </span>
<span class='v MT5_30' data-id='MT5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And if your right hand is a cause of trouble to you, let it be cut off and put it away from you; because it is better to undergo the loss of one part, than for all your body to go into hell. </span>
<span class='v MT5_31' data-id='MT5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Again, it was said, Whoever puts away his wife has to give her a statement in writing for this purpose: </span>
<span class='v MT5_32' data-id='MT5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that everyone who puts away his wife for any other cause but the loss of her virtue, makes her false to her husband; and whoever takes her as his wife after she is put away, is no true husband to her. </span>
<span class='v MT5_33' data-id='MT5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Again, you have knowledge that it was said in old times, Do not take false oaths, but give effect to your oaths to the Lord: </span>
<span class='v MT5_34' data-id='MT5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But I say to you, Take no oaths at all: not by the heaven, because it is the seat of God; </span>
<span class='v MT5_35' data-id='MT5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Or by the earth, because it is the resting-place for his foot; or by Jerusalem, because it is the town of the great King. </span>
<span class='v MT5_36' data-id='MT5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>You may not take an oath by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black. </span>
<span class='v MT5_37' data-id='MT5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But let your words be simply, Yes or No: and whatever is more than these is of the Evil One. </span>
<span class='v MT5_38' data-id='MT5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>You have knowledge that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: </span>
<span class='v MT5_39' data-id='MT5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>But I say to you, Do not make use of force against an evil man; but to him who gives you a blow on the right side of your face let the left be turned. </span>
<span class='v MT5_40' data-id='MT5_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And if any man goes to law with you and takes away your coat, do not keep back your robe from him. </span>
<span class='v MT5_41' data-id='MT5_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And whoever makes you go one mile, go with him two. </span>
<span class='v MT5_42' data-id='MT5_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Give to him who comes with a request, and keep not your property from him who would for a time make use of it. </span>
<span class='v MT5_43' data-id='MT5_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>You have knowledge that it was said, Have love for your neighbour, and hate for him who is against you: </span>
<span class='v MT5_44' data-id='MT5_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>But I say to you, Have love for those who are against you, and make prayer for those who are cruel to you; </span>
<span class='v MT5_45' data-id='MT5_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>So that you may be the sons of your Father in heaven; for his sun gives light to the evil and to the good, and he sends rain on the upright man and on the sinner. </span>
<span class='v MT5_46' data-id='MT5_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>For if you have love for those who have love for you, what credit is it to you? do not the tax-farmers the same? </span>
<span class='v MT5_47' data-id='MT5_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And if you say, Good day, to your brothers only, what do you do more than others? do not even the Gentiles the same? </span>
<span class='v MT5_48' data-id='MT5_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Be then complete in righteousness, even as your Father in heaven is complete. </span></div></div>
