<span class='v IS18_2' data-id='IS18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Which sends its representatives by the sea, even in ships of papyrus on the waters. Go back quickly, O representatives, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people causing fear through all their history; a strong nation, crushing down its haters, whose land is cut through by rivers. </span>
<span class='v IS18_3' data-id='IS18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All you peoples of the world, and you who are living on the earth, when a flag is lifted up on the mountains, give attention; and when the horn is sounded, give ear. </span>
<span class='v IS18_4' data-id='IS18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said to me: I will be quiet, watching from my place; like the clear heat when the sun is shining, like a mist of dew in the heat of summer. </span>
<span class='v IS18_5' data-id='IS18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For before the time of getting in the grapes, after the opening of the bud, when the flower has become a grape ready for crushing, he will take away the small branches with knives, cutting down and taking away the wide-stretching branches. </span>

<span class='v IS18_7' data-id='IS18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In that time an offering will be made to the Lord of armies from a people tall and smooth, causing fear through all their history; a strong nation, crushing down its haters, whose land is cut through by rivers, an offering taken to the place of the name of the Lord of armies, even Mount Zion. </span></div></div>
