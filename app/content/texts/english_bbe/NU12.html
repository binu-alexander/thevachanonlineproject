<span class='v NU12_1' data-id='NU12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Miriam and Aaron said evil against Moses, because of the Cushite woman to whom he was married, for he had taken a Cushite woman as his wife. </span>
<span class='v NU12_2' data-id='NU12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they said, Have the words of the Lord been given to Moses only? have they not come to us? And the Lord took note of it. </span>
<span class='v NU12_3' data-id='NU12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now the man Moses was more gentle than any other man on earth. </span>
<span class='v NU12_4' data-id='NU12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And suddenly the Lord said to Moses and Aaron and Miriam, Come out, you three, to the Tent of meeting. And the three of them went out. </span>
<span class='v NU12_5' data-id='NU12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, taking his place at the door of the Tent, and made Aaron and Miriam come before him. </span>
<span class='v NU12_6' data-id='NU12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he said, Now give ear to my words: if there is a prophet among you I will give him knowledge of myself in a vision and will let my words come to him in a dream. </span>
<span class='v NU12_7' data-id='NU12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>My servant Moses is not so; he is true to me in all my house: </span>
<span class='v NU12_8' data-id='NU12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>With him I will have talk mouth to mouth, openly and not in dark sayings; and with his eyes he will see the form of the Lord: why then had you no fear of saying evil against my servant Moses? </span>
<span class='v NU12_9' data-id='NU12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And burning with wrath against them, the Lord went away. </span>
<span class='v NU12_10' data-id='NU12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the cloud was moved from over the Tent; and straight away Miriam became a leper, as white as snow: and Aaron, looking at Miriam, saw that she was a leper. </span>
<span class='v NU12_11' data-id='NU12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Aaron said to Moses, O my lord, let not our sin be on our heads, for we have done foolishly and are sinners. </span>
<span class='v NU12_12' data-id='NU12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half wasted when he comes out from the body of his mother. </span>
<span class='v NU12_13' data-id='NU12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Moses, crying to the Lord, said, Let my prayer come before you, O God, and make her well. </span>
<span class='v NU12_14' data-id='NU12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, If her father had put a mark of shame on her, would she not be shamed for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days, and after that she may come in again. </span>
<span class='v NU12_15' data-id='NU12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So Miriam was shut up outside the tent-circle for seven days: and the people did not go forward on their journey till Miriam had come in again. </span>
<span class='v NU12_16' data-id='NU12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>After that, the people went on from Hazeroth and put up their tents in the waste land of Paran. </span></div></div>
