<span class='v IS53_1' data-id='IS53_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Who would have had faith in the word which has come to our ears, and to whom had the arm of the Lord been unveiled? </span>
<span class='v IS53_2' data-id='IS53_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For his growth was like that of a delicate plant before him, and like a root out of a dry place: he had no grace of form, to give us pleasure; </span>
<span class='v IS53_3' data-id='IS53_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Men made sport of him, turning away from him; he was a man of sorrows, marked by disease; and like one from whom men's faces are turned away, he was looked down on, and we put no value on him. </span>
<span class='v IS53_4' data-id='IS53_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But it was our pain he took, and our diseases were put on him: while to us he seemed as one diseased, on whom God's punishment had come. </span>
<span class='v IS53_5' data-id='IS53_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But it was for our sins he was wounded, and for our evil doings he was crushed: he took the punishment by which we have peace, and by his wounds we are made well. </span>
<span class='v IS53_6' data-id='IS53_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We all went wandering like sheep; going every one of us after his desire; and the Lord put on him the punishment of us all. </span>
<span class='v IS53_7' data-id='IS53_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Men were cruel to him, but he was gentle and quiet; as a lamb taken to its death, and as a sheep before those who take her wool makes no sound, so he said not a word. </span>
<span class='v IS53_8' data-id='IS53_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They took away from him help and right, and who gave a thought to his fate? for he was cut off from the land of the living: he came to his death for the sin of my people. </span>
<span class='v IS53_9' data-id='IS53_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And they put his body into the earth with sinners, and his last resting-place was with the evil-doers, though he had done no wrong, and no deceit was in his mouth. </span>
<span class='v IS53_10' data-id='IS53_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the Lord was pleased ... see a seed, long life, ... will do well in his hand. ... </span>
<span class='v IS53_11' data-id='IS53_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> ... made clear his righteousness before men ... had taken their sins on himself. </span>
<span class='v IS53_12' data-id='IS53_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For this cause he will have a heritage with the great, and he will have a part in the goods of war with the strong, because he gave up his life, and was numbered with the evil-doers; taking on himself the sins of the people, and making prayer for the wrongdoers. </span></div></div>
