<span class='v HS10_1' data-id='HS10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Israel is a branching vine, full of fruit; as his fruit is increased, so the number of his altars is increased; as the land is fair, so they have made fair pillars. </span>
<span class='v HS10_2' data-id='HS10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Their mind is taken away; now they will be made waste: he will have their altars broken down, he will give their pillars to destruction. </span>
<span class='v HS10_3' data-id='HS10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now, truly, they will say, We have no king, we have no fear of the Lord; and the king, what is he able to do for us? </span>
<span class='v HS10_4' data-id='HS10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Their words are foolish; they make agreements with false oaths, so punishment will come up like a poison-plant in a ploughed field. </span>
<span class='v HS10_5' data-id='HS10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The people of Samaria will be full of fear because of the ox of Beth-aven; its people will have sorrow for it, and its priests will give cries of grief for its glory, for the glory has gone in flight. </span>
<span class='v HS10_6' data-id='HS10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they will take it to Assyria and give it to the great king; shame will come on Ephraim, and Israel will be shamed because of its image. </span>
<span class='v HS10_7' data-id='HS10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for Samaria, her king is cut off, like mist on the water. </span>
<span class='v HS10_8' data-id='HS10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will come to destruction; thorns and waste plants will come up on their altars; they will say to the mountains, Be a cover over us; and to the hills, Come down on us. </span>
<span class='v HS10_9' data-id='HS10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>O Israel, you have done evil from the days of Gibeah; there they took up their position, so that the fighting against the children of evil might not overtake them in Gibeah. </span>
<span class='v HS10_10' data-id='HS10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I will come and give them punishment; and the peoples will come together against them when I give them the reward of their two sins. </span>
<span class='v HS10_11' data-id='HS10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Ephraim is a trained cow, taking pleasure in crushing the grain; but I have put a yoke on her fair neck; I will put a horseman on the back of Ephraim; Judah will be working the plough, Jacob will be turning up the earth. </span>
<span class='v HS10_12' data-id='HS10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Put in the seed of righteousness, get in your grain in mercy, let your unploughed earth be turned up: for it is time to make search for the Lord, till he comes and sends righteousness on you like rain. </span>
<span class='v HS10_13' data-id='HS10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You have been ploughing sin, you have got in a store of evil, the fruit of deceit has been your food: for you put faith in your way, in the number of your men of war. </span>
<span class='v HS10_14' data-id='HS10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So a great outcry will go up from among your people, and all your strong places will be broken, as Beth-arbel was broken by Shalman in the day of war, as the mother was broken on the rocks with her children. </span>
<span class='v HS10_15' data-id='HS10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So will Beth-el do to you because of your evil-doing; at dawn will the king of Israel be cut off completely. </span></div></div>
