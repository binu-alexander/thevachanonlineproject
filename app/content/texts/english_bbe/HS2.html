<span class='v HS2_1' data-id='HS2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Say to your brothers, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah. </span>
<span class='v HS2_2' data-id='HS2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Take up the cause against your mother, take it up, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband; let her put away her loose ways from her face, and her false ways from between her breasts; </span>
<span class='v HS2_3' data-id='HS2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For fear that I may take away her robe from her, making her uncovered as in the day of her birth; making her like a waste place and a dry land, causing her death through need of water. </span>
<span class='v HS2_4' data-id='HS2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will have no mercy on her children, for they are the children of her loose ways. </span>
<span class='v HS2_5' data-id='HS2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For their mother has been untrue; she who gave them birth has done things of shame, for she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my linen, my oil and my wine. </span>
<span class='v HS2_6' data-id='HS2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause I will put thorns in her road, building up a wall round her so that she may not go on her way. </span>
<span class='v HS2_7' data-id='HS2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And if she goes after her lovers she will not overtake them; if she makes search for them she will not see them; then will she say, I will go back to my first husband, for then it was better for me than now. </span>
<span class='v HS2_8' data-id='HS2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For she had no knowledge that it was I who gave her the grain and the wine and the oil, increasing her silver and gold which they gave to the Baal. </span>
<span class='v HS2_9' data-id='HS2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So I will take away again my grain in its time and my wine, and I will take away my wool and my linen with which her body might have been covered. </span>
<span class='v HS2_10' data-id='HS2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And now I will make her shame clear before the eyes of her lovers, and no one will take her out of my hand. </span>
<span class='v HS2_11' data-id='HS2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And I will put an end to all her joy, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her regular meetings. </span>
<span class='v HS2_12' data-id='HS2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I will make waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are the payments which my lovers have made to me; and I will make them a waste of trees, and the beasts of the field will take them for food. </span>
<span class='v HS2_13' data-id='HS2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I will give her punishment for the days of the Baals, to whom she has been burning perfumes, when she made herself fair with her nose-rings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, giving no thought to me, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS2_14' data-id='HS2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this cause I will make her come into the waste land and will say words of comfort to her. </span>
<span class='v HS2_15' data-id='HS2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And I will give her vine-gardens from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will give her answer there as in the days when she was young, and as in the time when she came up out of the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v HS2_16' data-id='HS2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And in that day, says the Lord, you will say to me, Ishi; and you will never again give me the name of Baali; </span>
<span class='v HS2_17' data-id='HS2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and never again will she say their names. </span>
<span class='v HS2_18' data-id='HS2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And in that day I will make an agreement for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven and the things which go low on the earth; I will put an end to the bow and the sword and war in all the land, and will make them take their rest in peace. </span>
<span class='v HS2_19' data-id='HS2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I will take you as my bride for ever; truly, I will take you as my bride in righteousness and in right judging, in love and in mercies. </span>
<span class='v HS2_20' data-id='HS2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I will take you as my bride in good faith, and you will have knowledge of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS2_21' data-id='HS2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And it will be, in that day, says the Lord, that I will give an answer to the heavens, and the heavens to the earth; </span>
<span class='v HS2_22' data-id='HS2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the earth will give its answer to the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give an answer to Jezreel; </span>
<span class='v HS2_23' data-id='HS2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And I will put her as seed in the earth, and I will have mercy on her to whom no mercy was given; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people, and they will say, My God. </span></div></div>
