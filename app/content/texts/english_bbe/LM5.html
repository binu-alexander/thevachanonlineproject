<span class='v LM5_1' data-id='LM5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Keep in mind, O Lord, what has come to us: take note and see our shame. </span>
<span class='v LM5_2' data-id='LM5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Our heritage is given up to men of strange lands, our houses to those who are not our countrymen. </span>
<span class='v LM5_3' data-id='LM5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>We are children without fathers, our mothers are like widows. </span>
<span class='v LM5_4' data-id='LM5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>We give money for a drink of water, we get our wood for a price. </span>
<span class='v LM5_5' data-id='LM5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Our attackers are on our necks: overcome with weariness, we have no rest. </span>
<span class='v LM5_6' data-id='LM5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We have given our hands to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians so that we might have enough bread. </span>
<span class='v LM5_7' data-id='LM5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Our fathers were sinners and are dead; and the weight of their evil-doing is on us. </span>
<span class='v LM5_8' data-id='LM5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Servants are ruling over us, and there is no one to make us free from their hands. </span>
<span class='v LM5_9' data-id='LM5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>We put our lives in danger to get our bread, because of the sword of the waste land. </span>
<span class='v LM5_10' data-id='LM5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Our skin is heated like an oven because of our burning heat from need of food. </span>
<span class='v LM5_11' data-id='LM5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They took by force the women in Zion, the virgins in the towns of Judah. </span>
<span class='v LM5_12' data-id='LM5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Their hands put princes to death by hanging: the faces of old men were not honoured. </span>
<span class='v LM5_13' data-id='LM5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The young men were crushing the grain, and the boys were falling under the wood. </span>
<span class='v LM5_14' data-id='LM5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The old men are no longer seated in the doorway, and the music of the young men has come to an end. </span>
<span class='v LM5_15' data-id='LM5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The joy of our hearts is ended; our dancing is changed into sorrow. </span>
<span class='v LM5_16' data-id='LM5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The crown has been taken from our head: sorrow is ours, for we are sinners. </span>
<span class='v LM5_17' data-id='LM5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Because of this our hearts are feeble; for these things our eyes are dark; </span>
<span class='v LM5_18' data-id='LM5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because of the mountain of Zion which is a waste; jackals go over it. </span>
<span class='v LM5_19' data-id='LM5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You, O Lord, are seated as King for ever; the seat of your power is eternal. </span>
<span class='v LM5_20' data-id='LM5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Why have we gone from your memory for ever? why have you been turned away from us for so long? </span>
<span class='v LM5_21' data-id='LM5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past. </span>
