<span class='v R116_2' data-id='R116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And when David had come to an end of making the burned offerings and peace-offerings, he gave the people a blessing in the name of the Lord. </span>

<span class='v R116_4' data-id='R116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he put some of the Levites before the ark of the Lord as servants, to keep the acts of the Lord in memory, and to give worship and praise to the Lord, the God of Israel: </span>
<span class='v R116_5' data-id='R116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Uzziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel, with corded instruments of music; and Asaph, with brass instruments sounding loudly; </span>
<span class='v R116_6' data-id='R116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests, blowing horns all the time before the ark of the agreement of God. </span>
<span class='v R116_7' data-id='R116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then on that day David first made the giving of praise to the Lord the work of Asaph and his brothers. </span>
<span class='v R116_8' data-id='R116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>O give praise to the Lord; give honour to his name, talking of his doings among the peoples. </span>

<span class='v R116_33' data-id='R116_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then let all the trees of the wood be sounding with joy before the Lord, for he is come to be the judge of the earth. </span>
<span class='v R116_34' data-id='R116_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>O give praise to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is unchanging for ever. </span>
<span class='v R116_35' data-id='R116_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And say, Be our saviour, O God of our salvation, and let us come back, and give us salvation from the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name and have glory in your praise. </span>
<span class='v R116_36' data-id='R116_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for ever and for ever. And all the people said, So be it; and gave praise to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v R116_37' data-id='R116_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>So he made Asaph and his brothers keep their places there before the ark of the agreement of the Lord, to do whatever had to be done before the ark at all times day by day: </span>
<span class='v R116_38' data-id='R116_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And Obed-edom, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah, with their brothers, sixty-eight of them, to be door-keepers: </span>
<span class='v R116_39' data-id='R116_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And Zadok the priest, with his brothers the priests, before the House of the Lord in the high place at Gibeon; </span>
<span class='v R116_40' data-id='R116_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>To give burned offerings to the Lord on the altar of burned offerings morning and evening, every day, as it is ordered in the law of the Lord which he gave to Israel; </span>
<span class='v R116_41' data-id='R116_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest who were marked out by name to give praise to the Lord, for his mercy is unchanging for ever; </span>
<span class='v R116_42' data-id='R116_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And Heman and Jeduthun had horns and brass instruments sounding loudly, and instruments of music for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun were to be at the door. </span>
<span class='v R116_43' data-id='R116_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And all the people went away, every man to his house; and David went back to give a blessing to his family. </span></div></div>
