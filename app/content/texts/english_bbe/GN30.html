<span class='v GN30_1' data-id='GN30_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Rachel, because she had no children, was full of envy of her sister; and she said to Jacob, If you do not give me children I will not go on living. </span>
<span class='v GN30_2' data-id='GN30_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But Jacob was angry with Rachel, and said, Am I in the place of God, who has kept your body from having fruit? </span>
<span class='v GN30_3' data-id='GN30_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then she said, Here is my servant Bilhah, go in to her, so that she may have a child on my knees, and I may have a family by her. </span>
<span class='v GN30_4' data-id='GN30_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her. </span>
<span class='v GN30_5' data-id='GN30_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Bilhah became with child, and gave birth to a son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_6' data-id='GN30_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Rachel said, God has been my judge, and has given ear to my voice, and has given me a son; so he was named Dan. </span>
<span class='v GN30_7' data-id='GN30_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And again Bilhah, Rachel's servant, was with child, and gave birth to a second son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_8' data-id='GN30_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Rachel said, I have had a great fight with my sister, and I have overcome her: and she gave the child the name Naphtali. </span>
<span class='v GN30_9' data-id='GN30_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When it was clear to Leah that she would have no more children for a time, she gave Zilpah, her servant, to Jacob as a wife. </span>
<span class='v GN30_10' data-id='GN30_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_11' data-id='GN30_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Leah said, It has gone well for me: and she gave him the name Gad. </span>
<span class='v GN30_12' data-id='GN30_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Zilpah, Leah's servant, gave birth to a second son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_13' data-id='GN30_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Leah said, Happy am I! and all women will give witness to my joy: and she gave him the name Asher. </span>
<span class='v GN30_14' data-id='GN30_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now at the time of the grain-cutting, Reuben saw some love-fruits in the field, and took them to his mother Leah. And Rachel said to her, Let me have some of your son's love-fruits. </span>
<span class='v GN30_15' data-id='GN30_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Leah said to her, Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband from me? and now would you take my son's love-fruits? Then Rachel said, You may have him tonight in exchange for your son's love-fruits. </span>
<span class='v GN30_16' data-id='GN30_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the evening, when Jacob came in from the field, Leah went out to him and said, Tonight you are to come to me, for I have given my son's love-fruits as a price for you. And he went in to her that night. </span>
<span class='v GN30_17' data-id='GN30_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And God gave ear to her and she became with child, and gave Jacob a fifth son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_18' data-id='GN30_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Leah said, God has made payment to me for giving my servant-girl to my husband: so she gave her son the name Issachar. </span>
<span class='v GN30_19' data-id='GN30_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And again Leah became with child, and she gave Jacob a sixth son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_20' data-id='GN30_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And she said, God has given me a good bride-price; now at last will I have my husband living with me, for I have given him six sons: and she gave him the name Zebulun. </span>
<span class='v GN30_21' data-id='GN30_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>After that she had a daughter, to whom she gave the name Dinah. </span>
<span class='v GN30_22' data-id='GN30_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then God gave thought to Rachel, and hearing her prayer he made her fertile. </span>
<span class='v GN30_23' data-id='GN30_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And she was with child, and gave birth to a son: and she said, God has taken away my shame. </span>
<span class='v GN30_24' data-id='GN30_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And she gave him the name Joseph, saying, May the Lord give me another son. </span>
<span class='v GN30_25' data-id='GN30_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now after the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, Let me go away to my place and my country. </span>
<span class='v GN30_26' data-id='GN30_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have been your servant, and let me go: for you have knowledge of all the work I have done for you. </span>
<span class='v GN30_27' data-id='GN30_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Laban said, If you will let me say so, do not go away; for I have seen by the signs that the Lord has been good to me because of you. </span>
<span class='v GN30_28' data-id='GN30_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Say then what your payment is to be and I will give it. </span>
<span class='v GN30_29' data-id='GN30_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob said, You have seen what I have done for you, and how your cattle have done well under my care. </span>
<span class='v GN30_30' data-id='GN30_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For before I came you had little, and it has been greatly increased; and the Lord has given you a blessing in everything I have done; but when am I to do something for my family? </span>
<span class='v GN30_31' data-id='GN30_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And Laban said, What am I to give you? And Jacob said, Do not give me anything; but I will again take up the care of your flock if you will only do this for me: </span>
<span class='v GN30_32' data-id='GN30_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Let me go through all your flock today, taking out from among them all the sheep which are marked or coloured or black, and all the marked or coloured goats: these will be my payment. </span>
<span class='v GN30_33' data-id='GN30_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And so you will be able to put my honour to the test in time to come; if you see among my flocks any goats which are not marked or coloured, or any sheep which is not black, you may take me for a thief. </span>
<span class='v GN30_34' data-id='GN30_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Laban said, Let it be as you say. </span>
<span class='v GN30_35' data-id='GN30_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So that day he took all the he-goats which were banded or coloured, and all the she-goats which were marked or coloured or had white marks, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons; </span>
<span class='v GN30_36' data-id='GN30_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And sent them three days' journey away: and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flock. </span>
<span class='v GN30_37' data-id='GN30_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob took young branches of trees, cutting off the skin so that the white wood was seen in bands. </span>
<span class='v GN30_38' data-id='GN30_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he put the banded sticks in the drinking-places where the flock came to get water; and they became with young when they came to the water. </span>
<span class='v GN30_39' data-id='GN30_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And because of this, the flock gave birth to young which were marked with bands of colour. </span>
<span class='v GN30_40' data-id='GN30_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>These lambs Jacob kept separate; and he put his flock in a place by themselves and not with Laban's flock. </span>
<span class='v GN30_41' data-id='GN30_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And whenever the stronger ones of the flock became with young, Jacob put the sticks in front of them in the drinking-places, so that they might become with young when they saw the sticks. </span>
<span class='v GN30_42' data-id='GN30_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>But when the flocks were feeble, he did not put the sticks before them; so that the feebler flocks were Laban's and the stronger were Jacob's. </span>
<span class='v GN30_43' data-id='GN30_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>So Jacob's wealth was greatly increased; he had great flocks and women-servants and men-servants and camels and asses. </span></div></div>
