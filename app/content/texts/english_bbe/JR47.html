<span class='v JR47_1' data-id='JR47_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the Lord which came to Jeremiah the prophet about the Philistines, before Pharaoh's attack on Gaza. </span>
<span class='v JR47_2' data-id='JR47_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord has said: See, waters are coming up out of the north, and will become an overflowing stream, overflowing the land and everything in it, the town and those who are living in it; and men will give a cry, and all the people of the land will be crying out in pain. </span>
<span class='v JR47_3' data-id='JR47_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>At the noise of the stamping of the feet of his war-horses, at the rushing of his carriages and the thunder of his wheels, fathers will give no thought to their children, because their hands are feeble; </span>
<span class='v JR47_4' data-id='JR47_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because of the day which is coming with destruction on all the Philistines, cutting off from Tyre and Zidon the last of their helpers: for the Lord will send destruction on the Philistines, the rest of the sea-land of Caphtor. </span>
<span class='v JR47_5' data-id='JR47_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The hair is cut off from the head of Gaza; Ashkelon has come to nothing; the last of the Anakim are deeply wounding themselves. </span>
<span class='v JR47_6' data-id='JR47_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>O sword of the Lord, how long will you have no rest? put yourself back into your cover; be at peace, be quiet. </span>
<span class='v JR47_7' data-id='JR47_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>How is it possible for it to be quiet, seeing that the Lord has given it orders? against Ashkelon and against the sea-land he has given it directions. </span></div></div>
