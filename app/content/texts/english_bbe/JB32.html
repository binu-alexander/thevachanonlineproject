<span class='v JB32_1' data-id='JB32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So these three men gave no more answers to Job, because he seemed to himself to be right. </span>
<span class='v JB32_2' data-id='JB32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was angry, burning with wrath against Job, because he seemed to himself more right than God; </span>
<span class='v JB32_3' data-id='JB32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he was angry with his three friends, because they had been unable to give him an answer, and had not made Job's sin clear. </span>
<span class='v JB32_4' data-id='JB32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now Elihu had kept quiet while Job was talking, because they were older than he; </span>
<span class='v JB32_5' data-id='JB32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, he was very angry. </span>
<span class='v JB32_6' data-id='JB32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, made answer and said, I am young, and you are very old, so I was in fear, and kept myself from putting my knowledge before you. </span>
<span class='v JB32_7' data-id='JB32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I said to myself, It is right for the old to say what is in their minds, and for those who are far on in years to give out wisdom. </span>
<span class='v JB32_8' data-id='JB32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But truly it is the spirit in man, even the breath of the Ruler of all, which gives them knowledge. </span>
<span class='v JB32_9' data-id='JB32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>It is not the old who are wise, and those who are full of years have not the knowledge of what is right. </span>
<span class='v JB32_10' data-id='JB32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I say, Give ear to me, and I will put forward my knowledge. </span>
<span class='v JB32_11' data-id='JB32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I was waiting for your words, I was giving ear to your wise sayings; while you were searching out what to say, </span>
<span class='v JB32_12' data-id='JB32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I was taking note; and truly not one of you was able to make clear Job's error, or to give an answer to his words. </span>
<span class='v JB32_13' data-id='JB32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Take care that you do not say, Wisdom is here; God may overcome him, but not man. </span>
<span class='v JB32_14' data-id='JB32_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will not put forward words like these, or make use of your sayings in answer to him. </span>
<span class='v JB32_15' data-id='JB32_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Fear has overcome them, they have no more answers to give; they have come to an end of words. </span>
<span class='v JB32_16' data-id='JB32_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And am I to go on waiting while they have nothing to say? while they keep quiet and give no more answers? </span>
<span class='v JB32_17' data-id='JB32_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will give my answer; I will put forward my knowledge: </span>
<span class='v JB32_18' data-id='JB32_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For I am full of words, I am unable to keep in my breath any longer: </span>
<span class='v JB32_19' data-id='JB32_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My stomach is like wine which is unable to get out; like skins full of new wine, it is almost burst. </span>
<span class='v JB32_20' data-id='JB32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Let me say what is in my mind, so that I may get comfort; let me give answer with open mouth. </span>
<span class='v JB32_21' data-id='JB32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Let me not give respect to any man, or give names of honour to any living. </span>
<span class='v JB32_22' data-id='JB32_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For I am not able to give names of honour to any man; and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away. </span></div></div>
