<span class='v R123_24' data-id='R123_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>These were the sons of Levi, grouped by families, the heads of the families of those who were numbered by name, by heads, all those of twenty years old and over who did the work of the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v R123_25' data-id='R123_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For David said, The Lord, the God of Israel, has given his people rest, and he has made his resting-place in Jerusalem for ever; </span>
