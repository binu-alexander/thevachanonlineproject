<span class='v R236_16' data-id='R236_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But they put shame on the servants of God, making sport of his words and laughing at his prophets, till the wrath of God was moved against his people, till there was no help. </span>
<span class='v R236_17' data-id='R236_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So he sent against them the king of the Chaldaeans, who put their young men to death with the sword in the house of their holy place, and had no pity for any, young man or virgin, old man or white-haired: God gave them all into his hands. </span>

<span class='v R236_19' data-id='R236_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the house of God was burned and the wall of Jerusalem broken down; all its great houses were burned with fire and all its beautiful vessels given up to destruction. </span>
<span class='v R236_20' data-id='R236_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And all who had not come to death by the sword he took away prisoners to Babylon; and they became servants to him and to his sons till the kingdom of Persia came to power: </span>
