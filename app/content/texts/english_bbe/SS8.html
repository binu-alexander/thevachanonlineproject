<span class='v SS8_1' data-id='SS8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Oh that you were my brother, who took milk from my mother's breasts! When I came to you in the street, I would give you kisses; yes, I would not be looked down on. </span>
<span class='v SS8_2' data-id='SS8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I would take you by the hand into my mother's house, and she would be my teacher. I would give you drink of spiced wine, drink of the pomegranate. </span>
<span class='v SS8_3' data-id='SS8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His left hand would be under my head, and his right hand about me. </span>
<span class='v SS8_4' data-id='SS8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, do not let love be moved till it is ready. </span>
<span class='v SS8_5' data-id='SS8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Who is this, who comes up from the waste places, resting on her loved one? It was I who made you awake under the apple-tree, where your mother gave you birth; there she was in pain at your birth. </span>
<span class='v SS8_6' data-id='SS8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Put me as a sign on your heart, as a sign on your arm; love is strong as death, and wrath bitter as the underworld: its coals are coals of fire; violent are its flames. </span>
<span class='v SS8_7' data-id='SS8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Much water may not put out love, or the deep waters overcome it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would be judged a price not great enough. </span>
<span class='v SS8_8' data-id='SS8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>We have a young sister, and she has no breasts; what are we to do for our sister in the day when she is given to a man? </span>
<span class='v SS8_9' data-id='SS8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If she is a wall, we will make on her a strong base of silver; and if she is a door, we will let her be shut up with cedar-wood. </span>
<span class='v SS8_10' data-id='SS8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; then was I in his eyes as one to whom good chance had come. </span>
<span class='v SS8_11' data-id='SS8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Solomon had a vine-garden at Baal-hamon; he let out the vine-garden to keepers; every one had to give a thousand bits of silver for its fruit. </span>
<span class='v SS8_12' data-id='SS8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My vine-garden, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, will have the thousand, and those who keep the fruit of them two hundred. </span>
<span class='v SS8_13' data-id='SS8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You who have your resting-place in the gardens, the friends give ear to your voice; make me give ear to it. </span>
<span class='v SS8_14' data-id='SS8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Come quickly, my loved one, and be like a roe on the mountains of spice. </span></div></div>
