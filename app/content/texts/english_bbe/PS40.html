<span class='v PS40_2' data-id='PS40_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He took me up out of a deep waste place, out of the soft and sticky earth; he put my feet on a rock, and made my steps certain. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_3' data-id='PS40_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God; numbers have seen it with fear, and put their faith in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_4' data-id='PS40_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Happy is the man who has faith in the Lord, and does not give honour to the men of pride or to those who are turned away to deceit. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_5' data-id='PS40_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>O Lord my God, great are the wonders which you have done in your thought for us; it is not possible to put them out in order before you; when I would give an account of them, their number is greater than I may say. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_6' data-id='PS40_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You had no desire for offerings of beasts or fruits of the earth; ears you made for me: for burned offerings and sin offerings you made no request. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_7' data-id='PS40_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I said, See, I come; it is recorded of me in the roll of the book, </span></div>

<span class='v PS40_9' data-id='PS40_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I have given news of righteousness in the great meeting; O Lord, you have knowledge that I have not kept back my words. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_10' data-id='PS40_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Your righteousness has not been folded away in my heart; I have made clear your true word and your salvation; I have not kept secret your mercy or your faith from the great meeting. </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_12' data-id='PS40_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For unnumbered evils are round about me; my sins have overtaken me, so that I am bent down with their weight; they are more than the hairs of my head, my strength is gone because of them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS40_13' data-id='PS40_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be pleased, O Lord, to take me out of danger; O Lord, come quickly and give me help. </span></div>

<span class='v PS40_14' data-id='PS40_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let those who go after my soul for its destruction have shame and trouble together; let them be turned back and made foolish who take pleasure in my trouble. </span></div>
