<br><div class='c'> 73</div>
<div class='d'>A Psalm. Of Asaph. </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_1' data-id='PS73_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Truly, God is good to Israel, even to such as are clean in heart. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_2' data-id='PS73_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But as for me, my feet had almost gone from under me; I was near to slipping; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_3' data-id='PS73_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Because of my envy of the men of pride, when I saw the well-being of the wrongdoers. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_4' data-id='PS73_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For they have no pain; their bodies are fat and strong. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_5' data-id='PS73_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They are not in trouble as others are; they have no part in the unhappy fate of men. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_6' data-id='PS73_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this reason pride is round them like a chain; they are clothed with violent behaviour as with a robe. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_7' data-id='PS73_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Their eyes are bursting with fat; they have more than their heart's desire. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_8' data-id='PS73_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Their thoughts are deep with evil designs; their talk from their seats of power is of cruel acts. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_9' data-id='PS73_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Their mouth goes up to heaven; their tongues go walking through the earth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_10' data-id='PS73_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this reason they are full of bread; and water is ever flowing for them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_11' data-id='PS73_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they say, How will the Lord see this? is there knowledge in the Most High? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_12' data-id='PS73_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Truly, such are the sinners; they do well at all times, and their wealth is increased. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_13' data-id='PS73_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As for me, I have made my heart clean to no purpose, washing my hands in righteousness; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_14' data-id='PS73_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For I have been troubled all the day; every morning have I undergone punishment. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_15' data-id='PS73_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If I would make clear what it is like, I would say, You are false to the generation of your children. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_16' data-id='PS73_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>When my thoughts were turned to see the reason of this, it was a weariness in my eyes; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_17' data-id='PS73_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Till I went into God's holy place, and saw the end of the evil-doers. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_18' data-id='PS73_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>You put their feet where there was danger of slipping, so that they go down into destruction. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_19' data-id='PS73_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>How suddenly are they wasted! fears are the cause of their destruction. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_20' data-id='PS73_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As a dream when one is awake, they are ended; they are like an image gone out of mind when sleep is over. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_21' data-id='PS73_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>My heart was made bitter, and I was pained by the bite of grief: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_22' data-id='PS73_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>As for me, I was foolish, and without knowledge; I was like a beast before you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_23' data-id='PS73_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But still I am ever with you; you have taken me by my right hand. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_24' data-id='PS73_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Your wisdom will be my guide, and later you will put me in a place of honour. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_25' data-id='PS73_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Whom have I in heaven but you? and having you I have no desire for anything on earth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_26' data-id='PS73_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>My flesh and my heart are wasting away: but God is the Rock of my heart and my eternal heritage. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_27' data-id='PS73_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For those who are far away from you will come to destruction: you will put an end to all those who have not kept faith with you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS73_28' data-id='PS73_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But it is good for me to come near to God: I have put my faith in the Lord God, so that I may make clear all his works. </span></div></div>
