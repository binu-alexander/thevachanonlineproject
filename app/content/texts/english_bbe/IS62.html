<span class='v IS62_2' data-id='IS62_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you will have a new name, given by the mouth of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS62_3' data-id='IS62_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And you will be a fair crown in the hand of the Lord, and a king's head-dress in the hand of your God. </span>
<span class='v IS62_4' data-id='IS62_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You will not now be named, She who is given up; and your land will no longer be named, The waste land: but you will have the name, My pleasure is in her, and your land will be named, Married: for the Lord has pleasure in you, and your land will be married. </span>
<span class='v IS62_5' data-id='IS62_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For as a young man takes a virgin for his wife, so will your maker be married to you: and as a husband has joy in his bride, so will the Lord your God be glad over you. </span>
<span class='v IS62_6' data-id='IS62_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I have put watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem; they will not keep quiet day or night: you who are the Lord's recorders, take no rest, </span>

<span class='v IS62_8' data-id='IS62_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The Lord has taken an oath by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Truly, I will no longer give your grain to be food for your haters; and men of strange countries will not take the wine for which your work has been done: </span>
<span class='v IS62_9' data-id='IS62_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But those who have got in the grain will have it for their food, and will give praise to the Lord; and those who have got in the grapes will take the wine of them in the open places of my holy house. </span>
<span class='v IS62_10' data-id='IS62_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Go through, go through the doors; make ready the way of the people; let the highway be lifted up; let the stones be taken away; let a flag be lifted up over the peoples. </span>
<span class='v IS62_11' data-id='IS62_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The Lord has sent out word to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, See, your saviour comes; those whom he has made free are with him, and those to whom he has given salvation go before him. </span>
<span class='v IS62_12' data-id='IS62_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they will be named, The holy people, Those whose cause has been taken up by the Lord: and you will be named, Desired, A town not given up. </span></div></div>
