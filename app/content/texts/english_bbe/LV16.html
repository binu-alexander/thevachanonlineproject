<span class='v LV16_2' data-id='LV16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Lord said to Moses, Say to Aaron, your brother, that he may not come at all times into the holy place inside the veil, before the cover which is on the ark, for fear that death may overtake him; for I will be seen in the cloud on the cover of the ark. </span>
<span class='v LV16_3' data-id='LV16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let Aaron come into the holy place in this way: with an ox for a sin-offering and a male sheep for a burned offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_4' data-id='LV16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let him put on the holy linen coat, and the linen trousers on his body, and the linen band round him, and the linen head-dress on his head; for this is holy clothing, and before he puts them on his body is to be washed with water. </span>
<span class='v LV16_5' data-id='LV16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And let him take from the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering and one male sheep for a burned offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_6' data-id='LV16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Aaron is to give the ox of the sin-offering for himself, to make himself and his house free from sin. </span>
<span class='v LV16_7' data-id='LV16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he is to take the two goats and put them before the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v LV16_8' data-id='LV16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will make selection from the two goats by the decision of the Lord, one goat for the Lord and one for Azazel. </span>
<span class='v LV16_9' data-id='LV16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the goat which is marked out for the Lord, let Aaron give for a sin-offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_10' data-id='LV16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the goat for Azazel is to be placed living before the Lord, for the taking away of sin, that it may be sent away for Azazel into the waste land. </span>
<span class='v LV16_11' data-id='LV16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Aaron is to give the ox of the sin-offering for himself and take away sin from himself and his house, and put to death the ox of the sin-offering which is for himself. </span>
<span class='v LV16_12' data-id='LV16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he is to take a vessel full of burning coal from the altar before the Lord and in his hand some sweet perfume crushed small, and take it inside the veil; </span>
<span class='v LV16_13' data-id='LV16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And let him put the perfume on the fire before the Lord so that the ark may be covered with a cloud of the smoke of the perfume, in order that death may not overtake him. </span>
<span class='v LV16_14' data-id='LV16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And let him take some of the blood of the ox, shaking drops of it from his finger on the cover of the ark on the east side, and before it, seven times. </span>
<span class='v LV16_15' data-id='LV16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then let him put to death the goat of the sin-offering for the people, and take its blood inside the veil and do with it as he did with the blood of the ox, shaking drops of it on and before the cover of the ark. </span>
<span class='v LV16_16' data-id='LV16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And let him make the holy place free from whatever is unclean among the children of Israel and from their wrongdoing in all their sins; and let him do the same for the Tent of meeting, which has its place among an unclean people. </span>

<span class='v LV16_19' data-id='LV16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Shaking drops of the blood from his finger on it seven times to make it holy and clean from whatever is unclean among the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v LV16_20' data-id='LV16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And when he has done whatever is necessary to make the holy place and the Tent of meeting and the altar free from sin, let him put the living goat before the Lord; </span>
<span class='v LV16_21' data-id='LV16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Aaron, placing his two hands on the head of the living goat, will make a public statement over him of all the evil doings of the children of Israel and all their wrongdoing, in all their sins; and he will put them on the head of the goat and send him away, in the care of a man who will be waiting there, into the waste land. </span>
<span class='v LV16_22' data-id='LV16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the goat will take all their sins into a land cut off from men, and he will send the goat away into the waste land. </span>

<span class='v LV16_27' data-id='LV16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the ox of the sin-offering and the goat of the sin-offering, whose blood was taken in to make the holy place free from sin, are to be taken away outside the tent-circle and their skins and their flesh and their waste are to be burned with fire. </span>
<span class='v LV16_28' data-id='LV16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And the man by whom they are burned is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water, and then he may come back to the tent-circle. </span>
<span class='v LV16_29' data-id='LV16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And let this be an order to you for ever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day, you are to keep yourselves from pleasure and do no sort of work, those who are Israelites by birth and those from other lands who are living among you: </span>
<span class='v LV16_30' data-id='LV16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For on this day your sin will be taken away and you will be clean: you will be made free from all your sins before the Lord. </span>

<span class='v LV16_32' data-id='LV16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And the man on whose head the holy oil has been put, and who has been marked out to be a priest in his father's place, will do what is necessary to take away sin, and will put on the linen clothing, even the holy robes: </span>
<span class='v LV16_33' data-id='LV16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he will make the holy place and the Tent of meeting and the altar free from sin; he will take away sin from the priests and from all the people. </span>
