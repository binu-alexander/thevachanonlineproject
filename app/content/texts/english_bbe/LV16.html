<span class='v LV16_3' data-id='LV16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let Aaron come into the holy place in this way: with an ox for a sin-offering and a male sheep for a burned offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_4' data-id='LV16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let him put on the holy linen coat, and the linen trousers on his body, and the linen band round him, and the linen head-dress on his head; for this is holy clothing, and before he puts them on his body is to be washed with water. </span>
<span class='v LV16_5' data-id='LV16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And let him take from the children of Israel two he-goats for a sin-offering and one male sheep for a burned offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_6' data-id='LV16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Aaron is to give the ox of the sin-offering for himself, to make himself and his house free from sin. </span>
<span class='v LV16_7' data-id='LV16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he is to take the two goats and put them before the Lord at the door of the Tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v LV16_8' data-id='LV16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Aaron will make selection from the two goats by the decision of the Lord, one goat for the Lord and one for Azazel. </span>
<span class='v LV16_9' data-id='LV16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the goat which is marked out for the Lord, let Aaron give for a sin-offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_10' data-id='LV16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the goat for Azazel is to be placed living before the Lord, for the taking away of sin, that it may be sent away for Azazel into the waste land. </span>

<span class='v LV16_28' data-id='LV16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And the man by whom they are burned is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water, and then he may come back to the tent-circle. </span>
<span class='v LV16_29' data-id='LV16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And let this be an order to you for ever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day, you are to keep yourselves from pleasure and do no sort of work, those who are Israelites by birth and those from other lands who are living among you: </span>
