<span class='v JR25_1' data-id='JR25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah king of Judah; this was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR25_2' data-id='JR25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This word Jeremiah gave out to all the people of Judah and to those living in Jerusalem, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR25_3' data-id='JR25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>From the thirteenth year of Josiah, the son of Amon, king of Judah, even till this day, for twenty-three years, the word of the Lord has been coming to me, and I have given it to you, getting up early and talking to you; but you have not given ear. </span>
<span class='v JR25_4' data-id='JR25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the Lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets, getting up early and sending them; but you have not given attention and your ear has not been open to give hearing; </span>
<span class='v JR25_5' data-id='JR25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Saying, Come back now, everyone from his evil way and from the evil of your doings, and keep your place in the land which the Lord has given to you and to your fathers, from times long past even for ever: </span>
<span class='v JR25_6' data-id='JR25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not go after other gods to be their servants and to give them worship, and do not make me angry with the work of your hands, causing evil to yourselves. </span>
<span class='v JR25_7' data-id='JR25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But you have not given ear to me, says the Lord; so that you have made me angry with the work of your hands, causing evil to yourselves. </span>
<span class='v JR25_8' data-id='JR25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So this is what the Lord of armies has said: Because you have not given ear to my words, </span>
<span class='v JR25_9' data-id='JR25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>See, I will send and take all the families of the north, says the Lord, and Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, my servant, and make them come against this land, and against its people, and against all these nations on every side; and I will give them up to complete destruction, and make them a cause of fear and surprise and a waste place for ever. </span>
<span class='v JR25_10' data-id='JR25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And more than this, I will take from them the sound of laughing voices, the voice of joy, the voice of the newly-married man, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the stones crushing the grain, and the shining of lights. </span>
<span class='v JR25_11' data-id='JR25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>All this land will be a waste and a cause of wonder; and these nations will be the servants of the king of Babylon for seventy years. </span>
<span class='v JR25_12' data-id='JR25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And it will come about, after seventy years are ended, that I will send punishment on the king of Babylon, and on that nation, says the Lord, for their evil-doing, and on the land of the Chaldaeans; and I will make it a waste for ever. </span>
<span class='v JR25_13' data-id='JR25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I will make that land undergo everything I have said against it, even everything recorded in this book, which Jeremiah the prophet has said against all the nations. </span>
<span class='v JR25_14' data-id='JR25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For a number of nations and great kings will make servants of them, even of them: and I will give them the reward of their acts, even the reward of the work of their hands. </span>
<span class='v JR25_15' data-id='JR25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said to me: Take the cup of the wine of this wrath from my hand, and make all the nations to whom I send you take of it. </span>
<span class='v JR25_16' data-id='JR25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And after drinking it, they will go rolling from side to side, and be off their heads, because of the sword which I will send among them. </span>
<span class='v JR25_17' data-id='JR25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then I took the cup from the Lord's hand, and gave a drink from it to all the nations to whom the Lord sent me; </span>
<span class='v JR25_18' data-id='JR25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Jerusalem and the towns of Judah and their kings and their princes, to make them a waste place, a cause of fear and surprise and a curse, as it is this day; </span>
<span class='v JR25_19' data-id='JR25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his servants and his princes and all his people; </span>
<span class='v JR25_20' data-id='JR25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And all the mixed people and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon and Gaza and Ekron and the rest of Ashdod; </span>
<span class='v JR25_21' data-id='JR25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Edom and Moab and the children of Ammon, </span>
<span class='v JR25_22' data-id='JR25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the lands across the sea; </span>
<span class='v JR25_23' data-id='JR25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Dedan and Tema and Buz, and all who have the ends of their hair cut; </span>
<span class='v JR25_24' data-id='JR25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed people living in the waste land; </span>
<span class='v JR25_25' data-id='JR25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; </span>
<span class='v JR25_26' data-id='JR25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JR25_27' data-id='JR25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And you are to say to them, This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Take of this cup and be overcome, and let it come out again from your lips, and from your fall you will never be lifted up again, because of the sword which I will send among you. </span>
<span class='v JR25_28' data-id='JR25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And it will be, if they will not take of the cup in your hand, then you are to say to them, This is what the Lord of armies has said: You will certainly take of it. </span>
<span class='v JR25_29' data-id='JR25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For see, I am starting to send evil on the town which is named by my name, and are you to be without any punishment? You will not be without punishment: for I will send a sword on all people living on the earth, says the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v JR25_30' data-id='JR25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So, as a prophet, give out these words among them, and say to them, The voice of the Lord will be sounding like a lion from on high; he will send out his voice from his holy place, like the loud voice of a lion, against his flock; he will give a cry, like those who are crushing the grapes, against all the people of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JR25_31' data-id='JR25_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>A noise will come, even to the end of the earth; for the Lord has a cause against the nations, he will give his decision against all flesh; as for the evil-doers, he will give them to the sword, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR25_32' data-id='JR25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord of armies has said: See, evil is going out from nation to nation, and a great storm will come up from the inmost parts of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JR25_33' data-id='JR25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And at that day, the bodies of those whom the Lord has put to death will be seen from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: there will be no weeping for them, their bodies will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth; they will be like waste on the face of the land. </span>
<span class='v JR25_34' data-id='JR25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Give cries of grief, you keepers of sheep; give cries for help, rolling yourselves in the dust, you chiefs of the flock: for the days of your destruction have fully come, and I will send you in all directions, and your fall will be like that of the males of the flock. </span>
<span class='v JR25_35' data-id='JR25_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>There will be no way of flight for the keepers of sheep, no road for the chiefs of the flock to get away safely. </span>
<span class='v JR25_36' data-id='JR25_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>A sound of the cry of the keepers of sheep, and the bitter crying of the chiefs of the flock! for the Lord has made waste their green fields. </span>
<span class='v JR25_37' data-id='JR25_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And there is no sound in the fields of peace, because of the burning wrath of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR25_38' data-id='JR25_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The lion has come out of his secret place, for the land has become a waste because of the cruel sword, and because of the heat of his wrath. </span></div></div>
