<span class='v HK3_1' data-id='HK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, put to Shigionoth. </span>
<span class='v HK3_2' data-id='HK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>O Lord, word of you has come to my ears; I have seen your work, O Lord; when the years come near make it clear; in wrath keep mercy in mind. </span>
<span class='v HK3_3' data-id='HK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>God came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. The heavens were covered with his glory, and the earth was full of his praise. </span>
<span class='v HK3_4' data-id='HK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He was shining like the light; he had rays coming out from his hand: there his power was kept secret. </span>
<span class='v HK3_5' data-id='HK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Before him went disease, and flames went out at his feet. </span>
<span class='v HK3_6' data-id='HK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>From his high place he sent shaking on the earth; he saw and nations were suddenly moved: and the eternal mountains were broken, the unchanging hills were bent down; his ways are eternal. </span>
<span class='v HK3_7' data-id='HK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The curtains of Cushan were troubled, and the tents of Midian were shaking. </span>
<span class='v HK3_8' data-id='HK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Was your wrath burning against the rivers? were you angry with the sea, that you went on your horses, on your war-carriages of salvation? </span>
<span class='v HK3_9' data-id='HK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Your bow was quite uncovered. Selah. By you the earth was cut through with rivers. </span>
<span class='v HK3_10' data-id='HK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The mountains saw you and were moved with fear; the clouds were streaming with water: the voice of the deep was sounding; the sun did not come up, and the moon kept still in her place. </span>
<span class='v HK3_11' data-id='HK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>At the light of your arrows they went away, at the shining of your polished spear. </span>
<span class='v HK3_12' data-id='HK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>You went stepping through the land in wrath, crushing the nations in your passion. </span>
<span class='v HK3_13' data-id='HK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You went out for the salvation of your people, for the salvation of the one on whom your holy oil was put; wounding the head of the family of the evil-doer, uncovering the base even to the neck. Selah. </span>
<span class='v HK3_14' data-id='HK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You have put your spears through his head, his horsemen were sent in flight like dry stems; they had joy in driving away the poor, in making a meal of them secretly. </span>
<span class='v HK3_15' data-id='HK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The feet of your horses were on the sea, on the mass of great waters. </span>
<span class='v HK3_16' data-id='HK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Hearing it, my inner parts were moved, and my lips were shaking at the sound; my bones became feeble, and my steps were uncertain under me: I gave sounds of grief in the day of trouble, when his forces came up against the people in bands. </span>
<span class='v HK3_17' data-id='HK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For though the fig-tree has no flowers, and there is no fruit on the vine, and work on the olive comes to nothing, and the fields give no food; and the flock is cut off from its resting-place, and there is no herd in the cattle-house: </span>
<span class='v HK3_18' data-id='HK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Still, I will be glad in the Lord, my joy will be in the God of my salvation. </span>
<span class='v HK3_19' data-id='HK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Lord God is my strength, and he makes my feet like roes' feet, guiding me on my high places. For the chief music-maker on corded instruments. </span></div></div>
