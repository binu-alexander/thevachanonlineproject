<span class='v PR24_1' data-id='PR24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Have no envy for evil men, or any desire to be with them: </span>
<span class='v PR24_2' data-id='PR24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For the purposes of their hearts are destruction, and their lips are talking of trouble. </span>
<span class='v PR24_3' data-id='PR24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The building of a house is by wisdom, and by reason it is made strong: </span>
<span class='v PR24_4' data-id='PR24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And by knowledge its rooms are full of all dear and pleasing things. </span>
<span class='v PR24_5' data-id='PR24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>A wise man is strong; and a man of knowledge makes strength greater. </span>
<span class='v PR24_6' data-id='PR24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For by wise guiding you will overcome in war: and in a number of wise guides there is salvation. </span>
<span class='v PR24_7' data-id='PR24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Wisdom is outside the power of the foolish: he keeps his mouth shut in the public place. </span>
<span class='v PR24_8' data-id='PR24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He whose purposes are bad will be named a man of evil designs. </span>
<span class='v PR24_9' data-id='PR24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The purpose of the foolish is sin: and the hater of authority is disgusting to others. </span>
<span class='v PR24_10' data-id='PR24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If you give way in the day of trouble, your strength is small. </span>
<span class='v PR24_11' data-id='PR24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Be the saviour of those who are given up to death, and do not keep back help from those who are slipping to destruction. </span>
<span class='v PR24_12' data-id='PR24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If you say, See, we had no knowledge of this: does not the tester of hearts give thought to it? and he who keeps your soul, has he no knowledge of it? and will he not give to every man the reward of his work? </span>
<span class='v PR24_13' data-id='PR24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>My son, take honey, for it is good; and the flowing honey, which is sweet to your taste: </span>
<span class='v PR24_14' data-id='PR24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So let your desire be for wisdom: if you have it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off. </span>
<span class='v PR24_15' data-id='PR24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not keep a secret watch, O evil-doer, against the fields of the upright man, or send destruction on his resting-place: </span>
<span class='v PR24_16' data-id='PR24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For an upright man, after falling seven times, will get up again: but trouble is the downfall of the evil. </span>
<span class='v PR24_17' data-id='PR24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Do not be glad at the fall of your hater, and let not your heart have joy at his downfall: </span>
<span class='v PR24_18' data-id='PR24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For fear that the Lord may see it, and it may be evil in his eyes, and his wrath may be turned away from him. </span>
<span class='v PR24_19' data-id='PR24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not be troubled because of evil-doers, or have envy of sinners: </span>
<span class='v PR24_20' data-id='PR24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For there will be no future for the evil man; the light of sinners will be put out. </span>
<span class='v PR24_21' data-id='PR24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>My son, go in fear of the Lord and the king: have nothing to do with those who are in high positions: </span>
<span class='v PR24_22' data-id='PR24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For their downfall will come suddenly; and who has knowledge of the destruction of those in high positions? </span>
<span class='v PR24_23' data-id='PR24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>These are more sayings of the wise: To have respect for a person's position when judging is not good. </span>
<span class='v PR24_24' data-id='PR24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He who says to the evil-doer, You are upright, will be cursed by peoples and hated by nations. </span>
<span class='v PR24_25' data-id='PR24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But those who say sharp words to him will have delight, and a blessing of good will come on them. </span>
<span class='v PR24_26' data-id='PR24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He gives a kiss with his lips who gives a right answer. </span>
<span class='v PR24_27' data-id='PR24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Put your work in order outside, and make it ready in the field; and after that, see to the building of your house. </span>
<span class='v PR24_28' data-id='PR24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Do not be a violent witness against your neighbour, or let your lips say what is false. </span>
<span class='v PR24_29' data-id='PR24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Say not, I will do to him as he has done to me; I will give the man the reward of his work. </span>
<span class='v PR24_30' data-id='PR24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I went by the field of the hater of work, and by the vine-garden of the man without sense; </span>
<span class='v PR24_31' data-id='PR24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And it was all full of thorns, and covered with waste plants, and its stone wall was broken down. </span>
<span class='v PR24_32' data-id='PR24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then looking at it, I gave thought: I saw, and I got teaching from it. </span>
<span class='v PR24_33' data-id='PR24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep: </span>
<span class='v PR24_34' data-id='PR24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man. </span></div></div>
