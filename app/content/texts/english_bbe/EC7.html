<span class='v EC7_1' data-id='EC7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A good name is better than oil of great price, and the day of death than the day of birth. </span>
<span class='v EC7_2' data-id='EC7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It is better to go to the house of weeping, than to go to the house of feasting; because that is the end of every man, and the living will take it to their hearts. </span>
<span class='v EC7_3' data-id='EC7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Sorrow is better than joy; when the face is sad the mind gets better. </span>
<span class='v EC7_4' data-id='EC7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The hearts of the wise are in the house of weeping; but the hearts of the foolish are in the house of joy. </span>
<span class='v EC7_5' data-id='EC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is better to take note of the protest of the wise, than for a man to give ear to the song of the foolish. </span>
<span class='v EC7_6' data-id='EC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Like the cracking of thorns under a pot, so is the laugh of a foolish man; and this again is to no purpose. </span>
<span class='v EC7_7' data-id='EC7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The wise are troubled by the ways of the cruel, and the giving of money is the destruction of the heart. </span>
<span class='v EC7_8' data-id='EC7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The end of a thing is better than its start, and a gentle spirit is better than pride. </span>
<span class='v EC7_9' data-id='EC7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be not quick to let your spirit be angry; because wrath is in the heart of the foolish. </span>
<span class='v EC7_10' data-id='EC7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Say not, Why were the days which have gone by better than these? Such a question comes not from wisdom. </span>
<span class='v EC7_11' data-id='EC7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Wisdom together with a heritage is good, and a profit to those who see the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC7_12' data-id='EC7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Wisdom keeps a man from danger even as money does; but the value of knowledge is that wisdom gives life to its owner. </span>
<span class='v EC7_13' data-id='EC7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Give thought to the work of God. Who will make straight what he has made bent? </span>
<span class='v EC7_14' data-id='EC7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the day of wealth have joy, but in the day of evil take thought: God has put the one against the other, so that man may not be certain what will be after him. </span>
<span class='v EC7_15' data-id='EC7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>These two have I seen in my life which is to no purpose: a good man coming to his end in his righteousness, and an evil man whose days are long in his evil-doing. </span>
<span class='v EC7_16' data-id='EC7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be not given overmuch to righteousness and be not over-wise. Why let destruction come on you? </span>
<span class='v EC7_17' data-id='EC7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Be not evil overmuch, and be not foolish. Why come to your end before your time? </span>
<span class='v EC7_18' data-id='EC7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is good to take this in your hand and not to keep your hand from that; he who has the fear of God will be free of the two. </span>
<span class='v EC7_19' data-id='EC7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Wisdom makes a wise man stronger than ten rulers in a town. </span>
<span class='v EC7_20' data-id='EC7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>There is no man on earth of such righteousness that he does good and is free from sin all his days. </span>
<span class='v EC7_21' data-id='EC7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not give ear to all the words which men say, for fear of hearing the curses of your servant. </span>
<span class='v EC7_22' data-id='EC7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your heart has knowledge how frequently others have been cursed by you. </span>
<span class='v EC7_23' data-id='EC7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>All this I have put to the test by wisdom; I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me. </span>
<span class='v EC7_24' data-id='EC7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Far off is true existence, and very deep; who may have knowledge of it? </span>
<span class='v EC7_25' data-id='EC7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I gave my mind to knowledge and to searching for wisdom and the reason of things, and to the discovery that sin is foolish, and that to be foolish is to be without one's senses. </span>
<span class='v EC7_26' data-id='EC7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I saw a thing more bitter than death, even the woman whose heart is full of tricks and nets, and whose hands are as bands. He with whom God is pleased will get free from her, but the sinner will be taken by her. </span>
<span class='v EC7_27' data-id='EC7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Look! this I have seen, said the Preacher, taking one thing after another to get the true account, </span>
<span class='v EC7_28' data-id='EC7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For which my soul is still searching, but I have it not; one man among a thousand have I seen; but a woman among all these I have not seen. </span>
<span class='v EC7_29' data-id='EC7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>This only have I seen, that God made men upright, but they have been searching out all sorts of inventions. </span></div></div>
