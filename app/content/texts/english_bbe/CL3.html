<span class='v CL3_1' data-id='CL3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If then you have a new life with Christ, give your attention to the things of heaven, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. </span>
<span class='v CL3_2' data-id='CL3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Keep your mind on the higher things, not on the things of earth. </span>
<span class='v CL3_3' data-id='CL3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For your life on earth is done, and you have a secret life with Christ in God. </span>
<span class='v CL3_4' data-id='CL3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>At the coming of Christ who is our life, you will be seen with him in glory. </span>
<span class='v CL3_5' data-id='CL3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then put to death your bodies which are of the earth; wrong use of the flesh, unclean things, passion, evil desires and envy, which is the worship of strange gods; </span>
<span class='v CL3_6' data-id='CL3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because of which the wrath of God comes on those who go against his orders; </span>
<span class='v CL3_7' data-id='CL3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Among whom you were living in the past, when you did such things. </span>
<span class='v CL3_8' data-id='CL3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But now it is right for you to put away all these things; wrath, passion, bad feeling, curses, unclean talk; </span>
<span class='v CL3_9' data-id='CL3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not make false statements to one another; because you have put away the old man with all his doings, </span>
<span class='v CL3_10' data-id='CL3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And have put on the new man, which has become new in knowledge after the image of his maker; </span>
<span class='v CL3_11' data-id='CL3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Where there is no Greek or Jew, no one with circumcision or without circumcision, no division between nations, no servant or free man: but Christ is all and in all. </span>
<span class='v CL3_12' data-id='CL3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As saints of God, then, holy and dearly loved, let your behaviour be marked by pity and mercy, kind feeling, a low opinion of yourselves, gentle ways, and a power of undergoing all things; </span>
<span class='v CL3_13' data-id='CL3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Being gentle to one another and having forgiveness for one another, if anyone has done wrong to his brother, even as the Lord had forgiveness for you: </span>
<span class='v CL3_14' data-id='CL3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And more than all, have love; the only way in which you may be completely joined together. </span>
<span class='v CL3_15' data-id='CL3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And let the peace of Christ be ruling in your hearts, as it was the purpose of God for you to be one body; and give praise to God at all times. </span>
<span class='v CL3_16' data-id='CL3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let the word of Christ be in you in all wealth of wisdom; teaching and helping one another with songs of praise and holy words, making melody to God with grace in your hearts. </span>
<span class='v CL3_17' data-id='CL3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And whatever you do, in word or in act, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving praise to God the Father through him. </span>
<span class='v CL3_18' data-id='CL3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as is right in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v CL3_19' data-id='CL3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Husbands, have love for your wives, and be not bitter against them. </span>
<span class='v CL3_20' data-id='CL3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Children, do the orders of your fathers and mothers in all things, for this is pleasing to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v CL3_21' data-id='CL3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Fathers, do not be hard on your children, so that their spirit may not be broken. </span>
<span class='v CL3_22' data-id='CL3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Servants, in all things do the orders of your natural masters; not only when their eyes are on you, as pleasers of men, but with all your heart, fearing the Lord: </span>
<span class='v CL3_23' data-id='CL3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whatever you do, do it readily, as to the Lord and not to men; </span>
<span class='v CL3_24' data-id='CL3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Being certain that the Lord will give you the reward of the heritage: for you are the servants of the Lord Christ. </span>
<span class='v CL3_25' data-id='CL3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For the wrongdoer will have punishment for the wrong he has done, without respect for any man's position. </span></div></div>
