<span class='v PR26_8' data-id='PR26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Giving honour to a foolish man is like attempting to keep a stone fixed in a cord. </span>
<span class='v PR26_9' data-id='PR26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Like a thorn which goes up into the hand of a man overcome by drink, so is a wise saying in the mouth of a foolish man. </span>

<span class='v PR26_15' data-id='PR26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The hater of work puts his hand deep into the basin: lifting it again to his mouth is a weariness to him. </span>
<span class='v PR26_16' data-id='PR26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The hater of work seems to himself wiser than seven men who are able to give an answer with good sense. </span>
<span class='v PR26_17' data-id='PR26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He who gets mixed up in a fight which is not his business, is like one who takes a dog by the ears while it is going by. </span>

<span class='v PR26_22' data-id='PR26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The words of one who says evil of his neighbour secretly are like sweet food, they go down into the inner parts of the stomach. </span>
<span class='v PR26_23' data-id='PR26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Smooth lips and an evil heart are like a vessel of earth plated with silver waste. </span>
<span class='v PR26_24' data-id='PR26_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>With his lips the hater makes things seem what they are not, but deceit is stored up inside him; </span>
<span class='v PR26_25' data-id='PR26_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When he says fair words, have no belief in him; for in his heart are seven evils: </span>
