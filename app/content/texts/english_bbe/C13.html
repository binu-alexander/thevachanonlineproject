<span class='v C13_1' data-id='C13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the teaching I gave you, my brothers, was such as I was able to give, not to those who have the Spirit, but to those who are still in the flesh, even to children in Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_2' data-id='C13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I gave you milk and not meat, because you were, then, unable to take it, and even now you are not able; </span>
<span class='v C13_3' data-id='C13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Because you are still in the flesh: for when there is envy and division among you, are you not still walking after the way of the flesh, even as natural men? </span>
<span class='v C13_4' data-id='C13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For when one says, I am of Paul; and another says, I am of Apollos; are you not talking like natural men? </span>
<span class='v C13_5' data-id='C13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? They are but servants who gave you the good news as God gave it to them. </span>
<span class='v C13_6' data-id='C13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave the increase. </span>
<span class='v C13_7' data-id='C13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So then the planter is nothing, and the waterer is nothing; but God who gives the increase. </span>
<span class='v C13_8' data-id='C13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now the planter and the waterer are working for the same end: but they will have their separate rewards in the measure of their work. </span>
<span class='v C13_9' data-id='C13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we are workers with God: you are God's planting, God's building. </span>
<span class='v C13_10' data-id='C13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In the measure of the grace given to me, I, as a wise master-builder, have put the base in position, and another goes on building on it. But let every man take care what he puts on it. </span>
<span class='v C13_11' data-id='C13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For there is no other base for the building but that which has been put down, which is Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v C13_12' data-id='C13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But on the base a man may put gold, silver, stones of great price, wood, dry grass, cut stems; </span>
<span class='v C13_13' data-id='C13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Every man's work will be made clear in that day, because it will be tested by fire; and the fire itself will make clear the quality of every man's work. </span>
<span class='v C13_14' data-id='C13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If any man's work comes through the test, he will have a reward. </span>
<span class='v C13_15' data-id='C13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>If the fire puts an end to any man's work, it will be his loss: but he will get salvation himself, though as by fire. </span>
<span class='v C13_16' data-id='C13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Do you not see that you are God's holy house, and that the Spirit of God has his place in you? </span>
<span class='v C13_17' data-id='C13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If anyone makes the house of God unclean, God will put an end to him; for the house of God is holy, and you are his house. </span>
<span class='v C13_18' data-id='C13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Let no man have a false idea. If any man seems to himself to be wise among you, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise. </span>
<span class='v C13_19' data-id='C13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolish before God. As it is said in the holy Writings, He who takes the wise in their secret designs: </span>
<span class='v C13_20' data-id='C13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And again, The Lord has knowledge of the reasonings of the wise, that they are nothing. </span>
<span class='v C13_21' data-id='C13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So let no one take pride in men. For all things are yours; </span>
<span class='v C13_22' data-id='C13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; </span>
<span class='v C13_23' data-id='C13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's. </span></div></div>
