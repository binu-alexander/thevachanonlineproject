<span class='v PR8_1' data-id='PR8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Is not wisdom crying out, and the voice of knowledge sounding? </span>
<span class='v PR8_2' data-id='PR8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>At the top of the highways, at the meeting of the roads, she takes her place; </span>
<span class='v PR8_3' data-id='PR8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Where the roads go into the town her cry goes out, at the doorways her voice is loud: </span>
<span class='v PR8_4' data-id='PR8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I am crying out to you, O men; my voice comes to the sons of men. </span>
<span class='v PR8_5' data-id='PR8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Become expert in reason, O you simple ones; you foolish ones, take training to heart. </span>
<span class='v PR8_6' data-id='PR8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Give ear, for my words are true, and my lips are open to give out what is upright. </span>
<span class='v PR8_7' data-id='PR8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For good faith goes out of my mouth, and false lips are disgusting to me. </span>
<span class='v PR8_8' data-id='PR8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>All the words of my mouth are righteousness; there is nothing false or twisted in them. </span>
<span class='v PR8_9' data-id='PR8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They are all true to him whose mind is awake, and straightforward to those who get knowledge. </span>
<span class='v PR8_10' data-id='PR8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Take my teaching, and not silver; get knowledge in place of the best gold. </span>
<span class='v PR8_11' data-id='PR8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For wisdom is better than jewels, and all things which may be desired are nothing in comparison with her. </span>
<span class='v PR8_12' data-id='PR8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I, wisdom, have made wise behaviour my near relation; I am seen to be the special friend of wise purposes. </span>
<span class='v PR8_13' data-id='PR8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The fear of the Lord is seen in hating evil: pride, a high opinion of oneself, the evil way, and the false tongue, are unpleasing to me. </span>
<span class='v PR8_14' data-id='PR8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Wise design and good sense are mine; reason and strength are mine. </span>
<span class='v PR8_15' data-id='PR8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Through me kings have their power, and rulers give right decisions. </span>
<span class='v PR8_16' data-id='PR8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Through me chiefs have authority, and the noble ones are judging in righteousness. </span>
<span class='v PR8_17' data-id='PR8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Those who have given me their love are loved by me, and those who make search for me with care will get me. </span>
<span class='v PR8_18' data-id='PR8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Wealth and honour are in my hands, even wealth without equal and righteousness. </span>
<span class='v PR8_19' data-id='PR8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My fruit is better than gold, even than the best gold; and my increase is more to be desired than silver. </span>
<span class='v PR8_20' data-id='PR8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I go in the road of righteousness, in the way of right judging: </span>
<span class='v PR8_21' data-id='PR8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So that I may give my lovers wealth for their heritage, making their store-houses full. </span>
<span class='v PR8_22' data-id='PR8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Lord made me as the start of his way, the first of his works in the past. </span>
<span class='v PR8_23' data-id='PR8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>From eternal days I was given my place, from the birth of time, before the earth was. </span>
<span class='v PR8_24' data-id='PR8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>When there was no deep I was given birth, when there were no fountains flowing with water. </span>
<span class='v PR8_25' data-id='PR8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Before the mountains were put in their places, before the hills was my birth: </span>
<span class='v PR8_26' data-id='PR8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When he had not made the earth or the fields or the dust of the world. </span>
<span class='v PR8_27' data-id='PR8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When he made ready the heavens I was there: when he put an arch over the face of the deep: </span>
<span class='v PR8_28' data-id='PR8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he made strong the skies overhead: when the fountains of the deep were fixed: </span>
<span class='v PR8_29' data-id='PR8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>When he put a limit to the sea, so that the waters might not go against his word: when he put in position the bases of the earth: </span>
<span class='v PR8_30' data-id='PR8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then I was by his side, as a master workman: and I was his delight from day to day, playing before him at all times; </span>
<span class='v PR8_31' data-id='PR8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Playing in his earth; and my delight was with the sons of men. </span>
<span class='v PR8_32' data-id='PR8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me then, my sons: for happy are those who keep my ways. </span>
<span class='v PR8_33' data-id='PR8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Take my teaching and be wise; do not let it go. </span>
<span class='v PR8_34' data-id='PR8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Happy is the man who gives ear to me, watching at my doors day by day, keeping his place by the pillars of my house. </span>
<span class='v PR8_35' data-id='PR8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>For whoever gets me gets life, and grace from the Lord will come to him. </span>
<span class='v PR8_36' data-id='PR8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But he who does evil to me, does wrong to his soul: all my haters are in love with death. </span></div></div>
