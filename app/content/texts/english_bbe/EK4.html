<span class='v EK4_1' data-id='EK4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And you, son of man, take a back and put it before you and on it make a picture of a town, even Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v EK4_2' data-id='EK4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And make an attack on it, shutting it in, building strong places against it, and making high an earthwork against it; and put up tents against it, placing engines all round it for smashing down its walls. </span>
<span class='v EK4_3' data-id='EK4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And take a flat iron plate, and put it for a wall of iron between you and the town: and let your face be turned to it, and it will be shut in and you will make an attack on it. This will be a sign to the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK4_4' data-id='EK4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then, stretching yourself out on your left side, take the sin of the children of Israel on yourself: for as long as you are stretched out, so long will the sin of the children of Israel be on you. </span>
<span class='v EK4_5' data-id='EK4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For I have had the years of their sin measured for you by a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: and you will take on yourself the sin of the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK4_6' data-id='EK4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when these days are ended, turning on your right side, you are to take on yourself the sin of the children of Judah: forty days, a day for a year, I have had it fixed for you. </span>
<span class='v EK4_7' data-id='EK4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And let your face be turned to where Jerusalem is shut in, with your arm uncovered, and be a prophet against it. </span>
<span class='v EK4_8' data-id='EK4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And see, I will put bands on you; and you will be stretched out without turning from one side to the other till the days of your attack are ended. </span>
<span class='v EK4_9' data-id='EK4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And take for yourself wheat and barley and different sorts of grain, and put them in one vessel and make bread for yourself from them; all the days when you are stretched on your side it will be your food. </span>
<span class='v EK4_10' data-id='EK4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And you are to take your food by weight, twenty shekels a day: you are to take it at regular times. </span>
<span class='v EK4_11' data-id='EK4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And you are to take water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: you are to take it at regular times. </span>
<span class='v EK4_12' data-id='EK4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And let your food be barley cakes, cooking it before their eyes with the waste which comes out of a man. </span>
<span class='v EK4_13' data-id='EK4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, Even so the children of Israel will have unclean bread for their food among the nations where I am driving them. </span>
<span class='v EK4_14' data-id='EK4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then I said, Ah, Lord! see, my soul has never been unclean, and I have never taken as my food anything which has come to a natural death or has been broken by beasts, from the time when I was young even till now; no disgusting flesh has ever come into my mouth. </span>
<span class='v EK4_15' data-id='EK4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow's waste in place of man's waste, and you will make your bread ready on it. </span>
<span class='v EK4_16' data-id='EK4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, see, I will take away from Jerusalem her necessary bread: they will take their bread by weight and with care, measuring out their drinking-water with fear and wonder: </span>
<span class='v EK4_17' data-id='EK4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So that they may be in need of bread and water and be wondering at one another, wasting away in their sin. </span></div></div>
