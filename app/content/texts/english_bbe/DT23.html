<span class='v DT23_4' data-id='DT23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because they gave you no bread or water on your way, when you came out of Egypt: and they got Balaam, the son of Peor, from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to put curses on you. </span>
<span class='v DT23_5' data-id='DT23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the Lord your God would not give ear to Balaam, but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you, because of his love for you. </span>

<span class='v DT23_11' data-id='DT23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But when evening comes near, let him take a bath: and after sundown he may come back to the tents. </span>
<span class='v DT23_12' data-id='DT23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let there be a place outside the tent-circle to which you may go; </span>
<span class='v DT23_13' data-id='DT23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And have among your arms a spade; and when you have been to that place, let that which comes from you be covered up with earth: </span>

<span class='v DT23_18' data-id='DT23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Do not take into the house of the Lord your God, as an offering for an oath, the price of a loose woman or the money given to one used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: for these two things are disgusting to the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v DT23_19' data-id='DT23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not take interest from an Israelite on anything, money or food or any other goods, which you let him have: </span>

<span class='v DT23_21' data-id='DT23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When you take an oath to the Lord, do not be slow to give effect to it: for without doubt the Lord your God will make you responsible, and will put it to your account as sin. </span>
<span class='v DT23_22' data-id='DT23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But if you take no oath, there will be no sin. </span>
<span class='v DT23_23' data-id='DT23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whatever your lips have said, see that you do it; for you gave your word freely to the Lord your God. </span>
