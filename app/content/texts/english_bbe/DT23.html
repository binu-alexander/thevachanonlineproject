<span class='v DT23_4' data-id='DT23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because they gave you no bread or water on your way, when you came out of Egypt: and they got Balaam, the son of Peor, from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to put curses on you. </span>
<span class='v DT23_5' data-id='DT23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the Lord your God would not give ear to Balaam, but let the curse be changed into a blessing to you, because of his love for you. </span>
