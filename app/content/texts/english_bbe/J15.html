<span class='v J15_2' data-id='J15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In this way, we are certain that we have love for the children of God, when we have love for God and keep his laws. </span>
<span class='v J15_3' data-id='J15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For loving God is keeping his laws: and his laws are not hard. </span>
<span class='v J15_4' data-id='J15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Anything which comes from God is able to overcome the world: and the power by which we have overcome the world is our faith. </span>

<span class='v J15_7' data-id='J15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit is the witness, because the Spirit is true. </span>
<span class='v J15_8' data-id='J15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood: and all three are in agreement. </span>
<span class='v J15_9' data-id='J15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If we take the witness of men to be true, the witness of God is greater: because this is the witness which God has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_10' data-id='J15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He who has faith in the Son of God has the witness in himself: he who has not faith in God makes him false, because he has not faith in the witness which God has given about his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_11' data-id='J15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And his witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_12' data-id='J15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He who has the Son has the life; he who has not the Son of God has not the life. </span>
