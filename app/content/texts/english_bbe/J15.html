<span class='v J15_2' data-id='J15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In this way, we are certain that we have love for the children of God, when we have love for God and keep his laws. </span>
<span class='v J15_3' data-id='J15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For loving God is keeping his laws: and his laws are not hard. </span>
