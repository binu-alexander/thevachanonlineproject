<span class='v MK11_1' data-id='MK11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Beth-phage and Bethany, at the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, </span>
<span class='v MK11_2' data-id='MK11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And said to them, Go into the little town opposite: and when you come to it, you will see a young ass with a cord round his neck, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose, and come back with him. </span>
<span class='v MK11_3' data-id='MK11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And if anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of him and will send him back straight away. </span>
<span class='v MK11_4' data-id='MK11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they went away and saw a young ass by the door outside in the open street; and they were getting him loose. </span>
<span class='v MK11_5' data-id='MK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And some of those who were there said to them, What are you doing, taking the ass? </span>
<span class='v MK11_6' data-id='MK11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they said to them the words which Jesus had said; and they let them go. </span>
<span class='v MK11_7' data-id='MK11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they took the young ass to Jesus, and put their clothing on him, and he got on his back. </span>
<span class='v MK11_8' data-id='MK11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And a great number put down their clothing in the way; and others put down branches which they had taken from the fields. </span>
<span class='v MK11_9' data-id='MK11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And those who went in front, and those who came after, were crying, Glory: A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord: </span>
<span class='v MK11_10' data-id='MK11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>A blessing on the coming kingdom of our father David: Glory in the highest. </span>
<span class='v MK11_11' data-id='MK11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he went into Jerusalem into the Temple; and after looking round about on all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. </span>
<span class='v MK11_12' data-id='MK11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And on the day after, when they had come out from Bethany, he was in need of food. </span>
<span class='v MK11_13' data-id='MK11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And seeing a fig-tree in the distance with leaves, he went to see if by chance it had anything on it: and when he came to it, he saw nothing but leaves, for it was not the time for the fruit. </span>
<span class='v MK11_14' data-id='MK11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he said to it, Let no man take fruit from you for ever. And his disciples took note of his words. </span>
<span class='v MK11_15' data-id='MK11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they came to Jerusalem; and he went into the Temple, and sent out those who were trading there, overturning the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who were offering doves for money; </span>
<span class='v MK11_16' data-id='MK11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he would not let any man take a vessel through the Temple. </span>
<span class='v MK11_17' data-id='MK11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he gave them teaching, and said to them, Is it not in the Writings, My house is to be named a house of prayer for all the nations? but you have made it a hole of thieves. </span>
<span class='v MK11_18' data-id='MK11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And it came to the ears of the chief priests and scribes, and they took thought how they might put him to death; being in fear of him, because all the people were full of wonder at his teaching. </span>
<span class='v MK11_19' data-id='MK11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And every evening he went out of the town. </span>
<span class='v MK11_20' data-id='MK11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And when they were going by in the morning, they saw the fig-tree dead from the roots. </span>
<span class='v MK11_21' data-id='MK11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Peter, having a memory of it, said to him, Master, see, the tree which was cursed by you is dead. </span>
<span class='v MK11_22' data-id='MK11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, answering, said to them, Have God's faith. </span>
<span class='v MK11_23' data-id='MK11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Truly I say to you, Whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and be put into the sea; and has no doubt in his heart, but has faith that what he says will come about, he will have his desire. </span>
<span class='v MK11_24' data-id='MK11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For this reason I say to you, Whatever you make a request for in prayer, have faith that it has been given to you, and you will have it. </span>
<span class='v MK11_25' data-id='MK11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And whenever you make a prayer, let there be forgiveness in your hearts, if you have anything against anyone; so that you may have forgiveness for your sins from your Father who is in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MK11_26' data-id='MK11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>[] </span>
<span class='v MK11_27' data-id='MK11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And they came again to Jerusalem: and while he was walking in the Temple, there came to him the chief priests and the scribes and those in authority: </span>
<span class='v MK11_28' data-id='MK11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? or who gave you authority to do these things? </span>
<span class='v MK11_29' data-id='MK11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, I will put to you one question; give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things. </span>
<span class='v MK11_30' data-id='MK11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? give me an answer. </span>
<span class='v MK11_31' data-id='MK11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And they gave thought to it among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not have faith in him? </span>
<span class='v MK11_32' data-id='MK11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But if we say, From men — they were in fear of the people, because all took John to be truly a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MK11_33' data-id='MK11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And they said in answer to Jesus, We have no idea. And Jesus said to them, And I will not say to you by what authority I do these things. </span></div></div>
