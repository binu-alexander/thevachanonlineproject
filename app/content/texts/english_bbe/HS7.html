<span class='v HS7_1' data-id='HS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When my desire was for the fate of my people to be changed and to make Israel well, then the sin of Ephraim was made clear, and the evil-doing of Samaria; for their ways are false, and the thief comes into the house, while the band of outlaws takes property by force in the streets. </span>
<span class='v HS7_2' data-id='HS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they do not say to themselves that I keep in mind all their sin; now their evil acts come round them on every side; they are before my face. </span>
<span class='v HS7_3' data-id='HS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In their sin they make a king for themselves, and rulers in their deceit. </span>
<span class='v HS7_4' data-id='HS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They are all untrue; they are like a burning oven; the bread-maker does not make up the fire from the time when the paste is mixed till it is leavened. </span>
<span class='v HS7_5' data-id='HS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>On the day of our king, the rulers made him ill with the heat of wine; his hand was stretched out with the men of pride. </span>
<span class='v HS7_6' data-id='HS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For they have made their hearts ready like an oven, while they are waiting secretly; their wrath is sleeping all night; in the morning it is burning like a flaming fire. </span>
<span class='v HS7_7' data-id='HS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They are all heated like an oven, and they put an end to their judges; all their kings have been made low; not one among them makes prayer to me. </span>
<span class='v HS7_8' data-id='HS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is mixed with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned. </span>
<span class='v HS7_9' data-id='HS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Men from other lands have made waste his strength, and he is not conscious of it; grey hairs have come on him here and there, and he has no knowledge of it. </span>
<span class='v HS7_10' data-id='HS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; but for all this, they have not gone back to the Lord their God, or made search for him. </span>
<span class='v HS7_11' data-id='HS7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Ephraim is like a foolish dove, without wisdom; they send out their cry to Egypt, they go to Assyria. </span>
<span class='v HS7_12' data-id='HS7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When they go, my net will be stretched out over them; I will take them like the birds of heaven, I will give them punishment, I will take them away in the net for their sin. </span>
<span class='v HS7_13' data-id='HS7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>May trouble be theirs! for they have gone far away from me; and destruction, for they have been sinning against me; I was ready to be their saviour, but they said false words against me. </span>
<span class='v HS7_14' data-id='HS7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And they have not made prayer to me in their hearts, but they make loud cries on their beds; they are cutting themselves for food and wine, they are turned against me. </span>
<span class='v HS7_15' data-id='HS7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Though I have given training and strength to their arms, they have evil designs against me. </span>
<span class='v HS7_16' data-id='HS7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They have gone to what is of no value; they are like a false bow; their captains will come to destruction by the sword, and their ruler by my wrath; for this, the land of Egypt will make sport of them. </span></div></div>
