<span class='v AM7_1' data-id='AM7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord God let me see: and I saw that, when the growth of the late grass was starting, he made locusts; it was the late growth after the king's cutting was done. </span>
<span class='v AM7_2' data-id='AM7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And it came about that after they had taken all the grass of the land, I said, O Lord God, have mercy: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small. </span>
<span class='v AM7_3' data-id='AM7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, It will not be. </span>
<span class='v AM7_4' data-id='AM7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord let me see: and I saw that the Lord God sent for a great fire to be the instrument of his punishment; and, after burning up the great deep, it was about to put an end to the Lord's heritage. </span>
<span class='v AM7_5' data-id='AM7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then said I, O Lord God, let there be an end: how will Jacob be able to keep his place? for he is small. </span>
<span class='v AM7_6' data-id='AM7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The Lord, changing his purpose about this, said, And this will not be. </span>
<span class='v AM7_7' data-id='AM7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>This is what he let me see: and I saw the Lord stationed by a wall made straight by a weighted line, and he had a weighted line in his hand. </span>
<span class='v AM7_8' data-id='AM7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A weighted line. Then the Lord said, See, I will let down a weighted line among my people Israel; never again will my eyes be shut to their sin: </span>
<span class='v AM7_9' data-id='AM7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the high places of Isaac will be unpeopled, and the holy places of Israel will be made waste; and I will come up against the family of Jeroboam with the sword. </span>
<span class='v AM7_10' data-id='AM7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Amaziah, the priest of Beth-el, sent to Jeroboam, king of Israel, saying, Amos has made designs against you among the people of Israel: the land is troubled by his words. </span>
<span class='v AM7_11' data-id='AM7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For Amos has said, Jeroboam will be put to the sword, and Israel will certainly be taken away as a prisoner out of his land. </span>
<span class='v AM7_12' data-id='AM7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go in flight into the land of Judah, and there get your living by working as a prophet: </span>
<span class='v AM7_13' data-id='AM7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But be a prophet no longer at Beth-el: for it is the holy place of the king, and the king's house. </span>
<span class='v AM7_14' data-id='AM7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Amos in answer said to Amaziah, I am no prophet, or one of the sons of the prophets; I am a herdman and one who takes care of sycamore-trees: </span>
<span class='v AM7_15' data-id='AM7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the Lord took me from the flock, and the Lord said to me, Go, be a prophet to my people Israel. </span>
<span class='v AM7_16' data-id='AM7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now then, give ear to the word of the Lord: You say, Be no prophet to Israel, and say not a word against the people of Isaac. </span>
<span class='v AM7_17' data-id='AM7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So this is what the Lord has said: Your wife will be a loose woman in the town, and your sons and your daughters will be put to the sword, and your land will be cut up into parts by a line; and you yourself will come to your end in an unclean land, and Israel will certainly be taken away a prisoner out of his land. </span></div></div>
