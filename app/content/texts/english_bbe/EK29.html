<span class='v EK29_1' data-id='EK29_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK29_2' data-id='EK29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, let your face be turned against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and be a prophet against him and against all Egypt: </span>
<span class='v EK29_3' data-id='EK29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Say to them, These are the words of the Lord: See, I am against you, Pharaoh, king of Egypt, the great river-beast stretched out among his Nile streams, who has said, The Nile is mine, and I have made it for myself. </span>
<span class='v EK29_4' data-id='EK29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will put hooks in your mouth, and the fish of your streams will be hanging from your skin; and I will make you come up out of your streams, with all the fish of your streams hanging from your skin. </span>
<span class='v EK29_5' data-id='EK29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I will let you be in the waste land, you and all the fish of your streams: you will go down on the face of the land; you will not be taken up or put to rest in the earth; I have given you for food to the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven. </span>
<span class='v EK29_6' data-id='EK29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And it will be clear to all the people of Egypt that I am the Lord, because you have been a false support to the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK29_7' data-id='EK29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When they took a grip of you in their hands, you were crushed so that their arms were broken: and when they put their weight on you for support, you were broken and all their muscles gave way. </span>
<span class='v EK29_8' data-id='EK29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For this cause the Lord has said: See, I am sending a sword on you, cutting off from you man and beast. </span>
<span class='v EK29_9' data-id='EK29_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the land of Egypt will be an unpeopled waste; and they will be certain that I am the Lord: because he has said, The Nile is mine, and I made it. </span>
<span class='v EK29_10' data-id='EK29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>See, then, I am against you and against your streams, and I will make the land of Egypt an unpeopled waste, from Migdol to Syene, even as far as the edge of Ethiopia. </span>
<span class='v EK29_11' data-id='EK29_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No foot of man will go through it and no foot of beast, and it will be unpeopled for forty years. </span>
<span class='v EK29_12' data-id='EK29_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I will make the land of Egypt a waste among the countries which are made waste, and her towns will be unpeopled among the towns which have been made waste, for forty years: and I will send the Egyptians in flight among the nations and wandering through the countries. </span>
<span class='v EK29_13' data-id='EK29_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said: At the end of forty years I will get the Egyptians together from the peoples where they have gone in flight: </span>
<span class='v EK29_14' data-id='EK29_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will let the fate of Egypt be changed, and will make them come back into the land of Pathros, into the land from which they came; and there they will be an unimportant kingdom. </span>
<span class='v EK29_15' data-id='EK29_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and never again will it be lifted up over the nations: I will make them small, so that they may not have rule over the nations. </span>
<span class='v EK29_16' data-id='EK29_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Egypt will no longer be the hope of the children of Israel, causing sin to come to mind when their eyes are turned to them: and they will be certain that I am the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK29_17' data-id='EK29_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK29_18' data-id='EK29_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, made his army do hard work against Tyre, and the hair came off every head and every arm was rubbed smooth: but he and his army got no payment out of Tyre for the hard work which he had done against it. </span>
<span class='v EK29_19' data-id='EK29_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For this cause the Lord has said: See, I am giving the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon: he will take away her wealth, and take her goods by force and everything which is there; and this will be the payment for his army. </span>
<span class='v EK29_20' data-id='EK29_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I have given him the land of Egypt as the reward for his hard work, because they were working for me, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK29_21' data-id='EK29_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In that day I will make a horn put out buds for the children of Israel, and I will let your words come freely among them, and they will be certain that I am the Lord. </span></div></div>
