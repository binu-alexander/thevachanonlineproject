<span class='v LV8_28' data-id='LV8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Moses took them from their hands, and they were burned on the altar on the burned offering, as a priest's offering for a sweet smell, an offering made by fire to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV8_29' data-id='LV8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Moses took the breast, waving it for a wave offering before the Lord; it was Moses' part of the sheep of the priest's offering, as the Lord gave orders to Moses. </span>
