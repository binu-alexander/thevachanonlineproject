<span class='v HK1_1' data-id='HK1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which Habakkuk the prophet saw. </span>
<span class='v HK1_2' data-id='HK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>How long, O Lord, will your ears be shut to my voice? I make an outcry to you about violent behaviour, but you do not send salvation. </span>
<span class='v HK1_3' data-id='HK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Why do you make me see evil-doing, and why are my eyes fixed on wrong? for wasting and violent acts are before me: and there is fighting and bitter argument. </span>
<span class='v HK1_4' data-id='HK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For this reason the law is feeble and decisions are not effected: for the upright man is circled round by evil-doers; because of which right is twisted. </span>
<span class='v HK1_5' data-id='HK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>See among the nations, and take note, and be full of wonder: for in your days I am doing a work in which you will have no belief, even if news of it is given to you. </span>
<span class='v HK1_6' data-id='HK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For see, I am sending the Chaldaeans, that bitter and quick-moving nation; who go through the wide spaces of the earth to get for themselves living-places which are not theirs. </span>
<span class='v HK1_7' data-id='HK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They are greatly to be feared: their right comes from themselves. </span>
<span class='v HK1_8' data-id='HK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And their horses are quicker than leopards and their horsemen more cruel than evening wolves; they come from far away, like an eagle in flight rushing on its food. </span>
<span class='v HK1_9' data-id='HK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They are coming all of them with force; the direction of their faces is forward, the number of their prisoners is like the sands of the sea. </span>
<span class='v HK1_10' data-id='HK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He makes little of kings, rulers are a sport to him; all the strong places are to be laughed at; for he makes earthworks and takes them. </span>
<span class='v HK1_11' data-id='HK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then his purpose will be changed, over-stepping the limit; he will make his strength his god. </span>
<span class='v HK1_12' data-id='HK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Are you not eternal, O Lord my God, my Holy One? for you there is no death. O Lord, he has been ordered by you for our punishment; and by you, O Rock, he has been marked out to put us right. </span>
<span class='v HK1_13' data-id='HK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Before your holy eyes sin may not be seen, and you are unable to put up with wrong; why, then, are your eyes on the false? why do you say nothing when the evil-doer puts an end to one who is more upright than himself? </span>
<span class='v HK1_14' data-id='HK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He has made men like the fishes of the sea, like the worms which have no ruler over them. </span>
<span class='v HK1_15' data-id='HK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He takes them all up with his hook, he takes them in his net, getting them together in his fishing-net: for which cause he is glad and full of joy. </span>
<span class='v HK1_16' data-id='HK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For this reason he makes an offering to his net, burning perfume to his fishing-net; because by them he gets much food and his meat is fat. </span>
<span class='v HK1_17' data-id='HK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this cause his net is ever open, and there is no end to his destruction of the nations. </span></div></div>
