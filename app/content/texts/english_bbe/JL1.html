<span class='v JL1_1' data-id='JL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word of the Lord which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel. </span>
<span class='v JL1_2' data-id='JL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give ear to this, you old men, and take note, you people of the land. Has this ever been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? </span>
<span class='v JL1_3' data-id='JL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Give the story of it to your children, and let them give it to their children, and their children to another generation. </span>
<span class='v JL1_4' data-id='JL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>What the worm did not make a meal of, has been taken by the locust; and what the locust did not take, has been food for the plant-worm; and what the plant-worm did not take, has been food for the field-fly. </span>
<span class='v JL1_5' data-id='JL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Come out of your sleep, you who are overcome with wine, and give yourselves to weeping; give cries of sorrow, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it has been cut off from your mouths. </span>
<span class='v JL1_6' data-id='JL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For a nation has come up over my land, strong and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the back teeth of a great lion. </span>
<span class='v JL1_7' data-id='JL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>By him my vine is made waste and my fig-tree broken: he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth; its branches are made white. </span>
<span class='v JL1_8' data-id='JL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed in haircloth for the husband of her early years. </span>
<span class='v JL1_9' data-id='JL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's servants, are sorrowing. </span>
<span class='v JL1_10' data-id='JL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The fields are wasted, the land has become dry; for the grain is wasted, the new wine is kept back, the oil is poor. </span>
<span class='v JL1_11' data-id='JL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The farmers are shamed, the workers in the vine-gardens give cries of grief, for the wheat and the barley; for the produce of the fields has come to destruction. </span>
<span class='v JL1_12' data-id='JL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The vine has become dry and the fig-tree is feeble; the pomegranate and the palm-tree and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are dry: because joy has gone from the sons of men. </span>
<span class='v JL1_13' data-id='JL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow, you priests; give cries of grief, you servants of the altar: come in, and, clothed in haircloth, let the night go past, you servants of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your God. </span>
<span class='v JL1_14' data-id='JL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting, let the old men, even all the people of the land, come together to the house of the Lord your God, crying out to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JL1_15' data-id='JL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Sorrow for the day! for the day of the Lord is near, and as destruction from the Ruler of all it will come. </span>
<span class='v JL1_16' data-id='JL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Is not food cut off before our eyes? joy and delight from the house of our God? </span>
<span class='v JL1_17' data-id='JL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The grains have become small and dry under the spade; the store-houses are made waste, the grain-stores are broken down; for the grain is dry and dead. </span>
<span class='v JL1_18' data-id='JL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>What sounds of pain come from the beasts! the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them; even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen. </span>
<span class='v JL1_19' data-id='JL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame. </span>
<span class='v JL1_20' data-id='JL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The beasts of the field are turning to you with desire: for the water-streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste. </span></div></div>
