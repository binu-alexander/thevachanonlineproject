<span class='v GN16_1' data-id='GN16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had given him no children; and she had a servant, a woman of Egypt whose name was Hagar. </span>
<span class='v GN16_2' data-id='GN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Sarai said to Abram, See, the Lord has not let me have children; go in to my servant, for I may get a family through her. And Abram did as Sarai said. </span>
<span class='v GN16_3' data-id='GN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So after Abram had been living for ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian servant, and gave her to Abram for his wife. </span>
<span class='v GN16_4' data-id='GN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he went in to Hagar and she became with child, and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for her master's wife. </span>
<span class='v GN16_5' data-id='GN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Sarai said to Abram, May my wrong be on you: I gave you my servant for your wife and when she saw that she was with child, she no longer had any respect for me: may the Lord be judge between you and me. </span>
<span class='v GN16_6' data-id='GN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Abram said, The woman is in your power; do with her whatever seems good to you. And Sarai was cruel to her, so that she went running away from her. </span>
<span class='v GN16_7' data-id='GN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord came to her by a fountain of water in the waste land, by the fountain on the way to Shur. </span>
<span class='v GN16_8' data-id='GN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said, Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from and where are you going? And she said, I am running away from Sarai, my master's wife. </span>
<span class='v GN16_9' data-id='GN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to her, Go back, and put yourself under her authority. </span>
<span class='v GN16_10' data-id='GN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the Lord said, Your seed will be greatly increased so that it may not be numbered. </span>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the Lord said, See, you are with child and will give birth to a son, to whom you will give the name Ishmael, because the ears of the Lord were open to your sorrow. </span>
<span class='v GN16_12' data-id='GN16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he will be like a mountain ass among men; his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him, and he will keep his place against all his brothers. </span>
<span class='v GN16_13' data-id='GN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And to the Lord who was talking with her she gave this name, You are a God who is seen; for she said, Have I not even here in the waste land had a vision of God and am still living? </span>
<span class='v GN16_14' data-id='GN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So that fountain was named, Fountain of Life and Vision: it is between Kadesh and Bered. </span>
<span class='v GN16_15' data-id='GN16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Hagar gave birth to a child, the son of Abram, to whom Abram gave the name of Ishmael. </span>
<span class='v GN16_16' data-id='GN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael. </span></div></div>
