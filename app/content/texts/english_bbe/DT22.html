<span class='v DT22_2' data-id='DT22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If their owner is not near, or if you are not certain who he is, then take the beast to your house and keep it till its owner comes in search of it, and then you are to give it back to him. </span>
<span class='v DT22_3' data-id='DT22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do the same with his ass or his robe or anything which has gone from your brother's keeping and which you have come across: do not keep it to yourself. </span>
<span class='v DT22_4' data-id='DT22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If you see your brother's ox or his ass falling down on the road, do not go by without giving him help in lifting it up again. </span>

<span class='v DT22_6' data-id='DT22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If by chance you see a place which a bird has made for itself in a tree or on the earth, with young ones or eggs, and the mother bird seated on the young ones or on the eggs, do not take the mother bird with the young: </span>
<span class='v DT22_7' data-id='DT22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>See that you let the mother bird go, but the young ones you may take; so it will be well for you and your life will be long. </span>
<span class='v DT22_8' data-id='DT22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you are building a house, make a railing for the roof, so that the blood of any man falling from it will not come on your house. </span>
<span class='v DT22_9' data-id='DT22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not have your vine-garden planted with two sorts of seed: or all of it may become a loss, the seed you have put in as well as the increase. </span>
<span class='v DT22_10' data-id='DT22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do not do your ploughing with an ox and an ass yoked together. </span>

<span class='v DT22_14' data-id='DT22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And says evil things about her and gives her a bad name, saying, I took this woman, and when I had connection with her it was clear to me that she was not a virgin: </span>
<span class='v DT22_15' data-id='DT22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then let the girl's father and mother put before the responsible men of the town, in the public place, signs that the girl was a virgin: </span>

<span class='v DT22_20' data-id='DT22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if what he has said is true, and she is seen to be not a virgin, </span>
<span class='v DT22_21' data-id='DT22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then they are to make the girl come to the door of her father's house and she will be stoned to death by the men of the town, because she has done evil and put shame on Israel, by acting as a loose woman in her father's house: so you are to put away evil from among you. </span>
<span class='v DT22_22' data-id='DT22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If a man is taken in the act of going in to a married woman, the two of them, the man as well as the woman, are to be put to death: so you are to put away the evil from Israel. </span>
<span class='v DT22_23' data-id='DT22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If a young virgin has given her word to be married to a man, and another man meeting her in the town, has connection with her; </span>

<span class='v DT22_25' data-id='DT22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But if the man, meeting such a virgin in the open country, takes her by force, then only the man is to be put to death; </span>
<span class='v DT22_26' data-id='DT22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Nothing is to be done to the virgin, because there is no cause of death in her: it is the same as if a man made an attack on his neighbour and put him to death: </span>
<span class='v DT22_27' data-id='DT22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For he came across her in the open country, and there was no one to come to the help of the virgin in answer to her cry. </span>
<span class='v DT22_28' data-id='DT22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>If a man sees a young virgin, who has not given her word to be married to anyone, and he takes her by force and has connection with her, and discovery is made of it; </span>
<span class='v DT22_29' data-id='DT22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then the man will have to give the virgin's father fifty shekels of silver and make her his wife, because he has put shame on her; he may never put her away all his life. </span>
