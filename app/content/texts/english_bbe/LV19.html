<span class='v LV19_8' data-id='LV19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And as for anyone who takes it for food, his sin will be on him, for he has put shame on the holy thing of the Lord: he will be cut off from his people. </span>

<span class='v LV19_10' data-id='LV19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And do not take all the grapes from your vine-garden, or the fruit dropped on the earth; let the poor man, and the man from another country, have these: I am the Lord your God. </span>
