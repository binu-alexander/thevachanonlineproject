<span class='v LV19_6' data-id='LV19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let it be used for food on the same day on which it is offered, or on the day after; and whatever is over on the third day is to be burned with fire. </span>
<span class='v LV19_7' data-id='LV19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If any of it is used for food on the third day, it is a disgusting thing and will not be pleasing to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV19_8' data-id='LV19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And as for anyone who takes it for food, his sin will be on him, for he has put shame on the holy thing of the Lord: he will be cut off from his people. </span>

<span class='v LV19_10' data-id='LV19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And do not take all the grapes from your vine-garden, or the fruit dropped on the earth; let the poor man, and the man from another country, have these: I am the Lord your God. </span>

<span class='v LV19_31' data-id='LV19_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Do not go after those who make use of spirits, or wonder-workers; do not go in their ways or become unclean through them: I am the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v LV19_32' data-id='LV19_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Get up from your seats before the white-haired, and give honour to the old, and let the fear of your God be before you: I am the Lord. </span>
