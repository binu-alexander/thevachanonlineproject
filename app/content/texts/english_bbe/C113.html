<span class='v C113_1' data-id='C113_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If I make use of the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am like sounding brass, or a loud-tongued bell. </span>
<span class='v C113_2' data-id='C113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And if I have a prophet's power, and have knowledge of all secret things; and if I have all faith, by which mountains may be moved from their place, but have not love, I am nothing. </span>
<span class='v C113_3' data-id='C113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And if I give all my goods to the poor, and if I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it is of no profit to me. </span>
<span class='v C113_4' data-id='C113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Love is never tired of waiting; love is kind; love has no envy; love has no high opinion of itself, love has no pride; </span>
<span class='v C113_5' data-id='C113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Love's ways are ever fair, it takes no thought for itself; it is not quickly made angry, it takes no account of evil; </span>
<span class='v C113_6' data-id='C113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It takes no pleasure in wrongdoing, but has joy in what is true; </span>
<span class='v C113_7' data-id='C113_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Love has the power of undergoing all things, having faith in all things, hoping all things. </span>
<span class='v C113_8' data-id='C113_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Though the prophet's word may come to an end, tongues come to nothing, and knowledge have no more value, love has no end. </span>
<span class='v C113_9' data-id='C113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For our knowledge is only in part, and the prophet's word gives only a part of what is true: </span>
<span class='v C113_10' data-id='C113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But when that which is complete is come, then that which is in part will be no longer necessary. </span>
<span class='v C113_11' data-id='C113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I made use of a child's language, I had a child's feelings and a child's thoughts: now that I am a man, I have put away the things of a child. </span>
<span class='v C113_12' data-id='C113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For now we see things in a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now my knowledge is in part; then it will be complete, even as God's knowledge of me. </span>
<span class='v C113_13' data-id='C113_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But now we still have faith, hope, love, these three; and the greatest of these is love. </span></div></div>
