<span class='v LV24_2' data-id='LV24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give orders to the children of Israel to give you clean olive oil for the light, so that a light may be burning at all times, </span>
<span class='v LV24_3' data-id='LV24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Outside the veil of the ark in the Tent of meeting; let Aaron see that it is burning from evening till morning at all times before the Lord: it is a rule for ever through all your generations. </span>
<span class='v LV24_4' data-id='LV24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let Aaron put the lights in order on the support before the Lord at all times. </span>

<span class='v LV24_6' data-id='LV24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And put them in two lines, six in a line, on the holy table before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV24_7' data-id='LV24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And on the lines of cakes put clean sweet-smelling spices, for a sign on the bread, an offering made by fire to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV24_8' data-id='LV24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Every Sabbath day regularly, the priest is to put it in order before the Lord: it is offered for the children of Israel, an agreement made for ever. </span>
<span class='v LV24_9' data-id='LV24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And it will be for Aaron and his sons; they are to take it for food in a holy place: it is the most holy of all the offerings made by fire to the Lord, a rule for ever. </span>
<span class='v LV24_10' data-id='LV24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And a son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel and had a fight with a man of Israel by the tents; </span>
<span class='v LV24_11' data-id='LV24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the son of the Israelite woman said evil against the holy Name, with curses; and they took him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. </span>
<span class='v LV24_12' data-id='LV24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they kept him shut up, till a decision might be given by the mouth of the Lord. </span>

<span class='v LV24_15' data-id='LV24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And say to the children of Israel, As for any man cursing God, his sin will be on his head. </span>
<span class='v LV24_16' data-id='LV24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he who says evil against the name of the Lord will certainly be put to death; he will be stoned by all the people; the man who is not of your nation and one who is an Israelite by birth, whoever says evil against the holy Name is to be put to death. </span>
<span class='v LV24_17' data-id='LV24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And anyone who takes another's life is certainly to be put to death. </span>

<span class='v LV24_21' data-id='LV24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He who puts a beast to death will have to make payment for it; he who puts a man to death will himself be put to death. </span>
<span class='v LV24_22' data-id='LV24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You are to have the same law for a man of another nation living among you as for an Israelite; for I am the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v LV24_23' data-id='LV24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Moses said these words to the children of Israel, and they took the man who had been cursing outside the tent-circle and had him stoned. The children of Israel did as the Lord gave orders to Moses. </span></div></div>
