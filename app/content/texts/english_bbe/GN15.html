<span class='v GN15_1' data-id='GN15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Have no fear, Abram: I will keep you safe, and great will be your reward. </span>
<span class='v GN15_2' data-id='GN15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Abram said, What will you give me? for I have no child and this Eliezer of Damascus will have all my wealth after me. </span>
<span class='v GN15_3' data-id='GN15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Abram said, You have given me no child, and a servant in my house will get the heritage. </span>
<span class='v GN15_4' data-id='GN15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then said the Lord, This man will not get the heritage, but a son of your body will have your property after you. </span>
<span class='v GN15_5' data-id='GN15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he took him out into the open air, and said to him, Let your eyes be lifted to heaven, and see if the stars may be numbered; even so will your seed be. </span>
<span class='v GN15_6' data-id='GN15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he had faith in the Lord, and it was put to his account as righteousness. </span>
<span class='v GN15_7' data-id='GN15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, I am the Lord, who took you from Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land for your heritage. </span>
<span class='v GN15_8' data-id='GN15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said, O Lord God, how may I be certain that it will be mine? </span>
<span class='v GN15_9' data-id='GN15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said, Take a young cow of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a sheep of three years old, and a dove and a young pigeon. </span>
<span class='v GN15_10' data-id='GN15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>All these he took, cutting them in two and putting one half opposite the other, but not cutting the birds in two. </span>
<span class='v GN15_11' data-id='GN15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And evil birds came down on the bodies, but Abram sent them away. </span>
<span class='v GN15_12' data-id='GN15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep came on Abram, and a dark cloud of fear. </span>
<span class='v GN15_13' data-id='GN15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he said to Abram, Truly, your seed will be living in a land which is not theirs, as servants to a people who will be cruel to them for four hundred years; </span>
<span class='v GN15_14' data-id='GN15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I will be the judge of that nation whose servants they are, and they will come out from among them with great wealth. </span>
<span class='v GN15_15' data-id='GN15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As for you, you will go to your fathers in peace; at the end of a long life you will be put in your last resting-place. </span>
<span class='v GN15_16' data-id='GN15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And in the fourth generation they will come back here; for at present the sin of the Amorite is not full. </span>
<span class='v GN15_17' data-id='GN15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then when the sun went down and it was dark, he saw a smoking fire and a flaming light which went between the parts of the bodies. </span>
<span class='v GN15_18' data-id='GN15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In that day the Lord made an agreement with Abram, and said, To your seed have I given this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates: </span>
<span class='v GN15_19' data-id='GN15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Kenite, the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, </span>
<span class='v GN15_20' data-id='GN15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, </span>
<span class='v GN15_21' data-id='GN15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite. </span></div></div>
