<span class='v JN10_1' data-id='JN10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Truly I say to you, He who does not go through the door into the place where the sheep are kept, but gets in by some other way, is a thief and an outlaw. </span>
<span class='v JN10_2' data-id='JN10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He who goes in by the door is the keeper of the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_3' data-id='JN10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The porter lets him in; and the sheep give ear to his voice; he says over the names of the sheep, and takes them out. </span>
<span class='v JN10_4' data-id='JN10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When he has got them all out, he goes before them, and the sheep go after him, for they have knowledge of his voice. </span>
<span class='v JN10_5' data-id='JN10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They will not go after another who is not their keeper, but will go from him in flight, because his voice is strange to them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_6' data-id='JN10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In this Jesus was teaching them in the form of a story: but what he said was not clear to them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_7' data-id='JN10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said again, Truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_8' data-id='JN10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>All who came before me are thieves and outlaws: but the sheep did not give ear to them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_9' data-id='JN10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I am the door: if any man goes in through me he will have salvation, and will go in and go out, and will get food. </span>
<span class='v JN10_10' data-id='JN10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The thief comes only to take the sheep and to put them to death: he comes for their destruction: I have come so that they may have life and have it in greater measure. </span>
<span class='v JN10_11' data-id='JN10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am the good keeper of sheep: the good keeper gives his life for the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_12' data-id='JN10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He who is a servant, and not the keeper or the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming and goes in flight, away from the sheep; and the wolf comes down on them and sends them in all directions: </span>
<span class='v JN10_13' data-id='JN10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Because he is a servant he has no interest in the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_14' data-id='JN10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am the good keeper; I have knowledge of my sheep, and they have knowledge of me, </span>
<span class='v JN10_15' data-id='JN10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Even as the Father has knowledge of me and I of the Father; and I am giving my life for the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_16' data-id='JN10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I have other sheep which are not of this field: I will be their guide in the same way, and they will give ear to my voice, so there will be one flock and one keeper. </span>
<span class='v JN10_17' data-id='JN10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this reason am I loved by the Father, because I give up my life so that I may take it again. </span>
<span class='v JN10_18' data-id='JN10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>No one takes it away from me; I give it up of myself. I have power to give it up, and I have power to take it again. These orders I have from my Father. </span>
<span class='v JN10_19' data-id='JN10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>There was a division again among the Jews because of these words. </span>
<span class='v JN10_20' data-id='JN10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And a number of them said, He has an evil spirit and is out of his mind; why do you give ear to him? </span>
<span class='v JN10_21' data-id='JN10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Others said, These are not the words of one who has an evil spirit. Is it possible for an evil spirit to make blind people see? </span>
<span class='v JN10_22' data-id='JN10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then came the feast of the opening of the Temple in Jerusalem: it was winter; </span>
<span class='v JN10_23' data-id='JN10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus was walking in the Temple, in Solomon's covered way. </span>
<span class='v JN10_24' data-id='JN10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews came round him, saying, how long are you going to keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ, say so clearly. </span>
<span class='v JN10_25' data-id='JN10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus said in answer, I have said it and you have no belief: the works which I do in my Father's name, these give witness about me. </span>
<span class='v JN10_26' data-id='JN10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But you have no belief because you are not of my sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_27' data-id='JN10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>My sheep give ear to my voice, and I have knowledge of them, and they come after me: </span>
<span class='v JN10_28' data-id='JN10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And I give them eternal life; they will never come to destruction, and no one will ever take them out of my hand. </span>
<span class='v JN10_29' data-id='JN10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>That which my Father has given to me has more value than all; and no one is able to take anything out of the Father's hand. </span>
<span class='v JN10_30' data-id='JN10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I and my Father are one. </span>
<span class='v JN10_31' data-id='JN10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then the Jews took up stones again to send at him. </span>
<span class='v JN10_32' data-id='JN10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them in answer, I have let you see a number of good works from the Father; for which of those works are you stoning me? </span>
<span class='v JN10_33' data-id='JN10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>This was their answer: We are not stoning you for a good work but for evil words; because being a man you make yourself God. </span>
<span class='v JN10_34' data-id='JN10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>In answer, Jesus said, Is there not a saying in your law, I said, You are gods? </span>
<span class='v JN10_35' data-id='JN10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>If he said they were gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Writings may not be broken), </span>
<span class='v JN10_36' data-id='JN10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Do you say of him whom the Father made holy and sent into the world, Your words are evil; because I said, I am God's Son? </span>
<span class='v JN10_37' data-id='JN10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not have belief in me; </span>
<span class='v JN10_38' data-id='JN10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But if I am doing them, then have belief in the works even if you have no belief in me; so that you may see clearly and be certain that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. </span>
<span class='v JN10_39' data-id='JN10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then again they made an attempt to take him; but he got away from them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_40' data-id='JN10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And he went again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John first gave baptism; and he was there for a time. </span>
<span class='v JN10_41' data-id='JN10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And a great number of people came to him, saying, John did no sign: but everything John said of this man was true. </span>
<span class='v JN10_42' data-id='JN10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And a number came to have faith in him there. </span></div></div>
