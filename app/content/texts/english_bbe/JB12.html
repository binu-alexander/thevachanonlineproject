<span class='v JB12_2' data-id='JB12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>No doubt you have knowledge, and wisdom will come to an end with you. </span>
<span class='v JB12_3' data-id='JB12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I have a mind as well as you; I am equal to you: yes, who has not knowledge of such things as these? </span>
<span class='v JB12_4' data-id='JB12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It seems that I am to be as one who is a cause of laughing to his neighbour, one who makes his prayer to God and is answered! the upright man who has done no wrong is to be made sport of! </span>
<span class='v JB12_5' data-id='JB12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the thought of him who is in comfort there is no respect for one who is in trouble; such is the fate of those whose feet are slipping. </span>
<span class='v JB12_6' data-id='JB12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There is wealth in the tents of those who make destruction, and those by whom God is moved to wrath are safe; even those whose god is their strength. </span>
<span class='v JB12_7' data-id='JB12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But put now a question to the beasts, and get teaching from them; or to the birds of the heaven, and they will make it clear to you; </span>
<span class='v JB12_8' data-id='JB12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Or to the things which go flat on the earth, and they will give you wisdom; and the fishes of the sea will give you news of it. </span>
<span class='v JB12_9' data-id='JB12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Who does not see by all these that the hand of the Lord has done this? </span>
<span class='v JB12_10' data-id='JB12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all flesh of man. </span>
<span class='v JB12_11' data-id='JB12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Are not words tested by the ear, even as food is tasted by the mouth? </span>
<span class='v JB12_12' data-id='JB12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Old men have wisdom, and a long life gives knowledge. </span>
<span class='v JB12_13' data-id='JB12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>With him there is wisdom and strength; power and knowledge are his. </span>
<span class='v JB12_14' data-id='JB12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Truly, there is no building up of what is pulled down by him; when a man is shut up by him, no one may let him loose. </span>
<span class='v JB12_15' data-id='JB12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Truly, he keeps back the waters and they are dry; he sends them out and the earth is overturned. </span>
<span class='v JB12_16' data-id='JB12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>With him are strength and wise designs; he who is guided into error, together with his guide, are in his hands; </span>
<span class='v JB12_17' data-id='JB12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He takes away the wisdom of the wise guides, and makes judges foolish; </span>
<span class='v JB12_18' data-id='JB12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He undoes the chains of kings, and puts his band on them; </span>
<span class='v JB12_19' data-id='JB12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He makes priests prisoners, overturning those in safe positions; </span>
<span class='v JB12_20' data-id='JB12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He makes the words of responsible persons without effect, and takes away the good sense of the old; </span>
<span class='v JB12_21' data-id='JB12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He puts shame on chiefs, and takes away the power of the strong; </span>
<span class='v JB12_22' data-id='JB12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Uncovering deep things out of the dark, and making the deep shade bright; </span>
<span class='v JB12_23' data-id='JB12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Increasing nations, and sending destruction on them; making wide the lands of peoples, and then giving them up. </span>
<span class='v JB12_24' data-id='JB12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He takes away the wisdom of the rulers of the earth, and sends them wandering in a waste where there is no way. </span>
<span class='v JB12_25' data-id='JB12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They go feeling about in the dark without light, wandering without help like those overcome with wine. </span></div></div>
