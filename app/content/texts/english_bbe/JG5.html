<span class='v JG5_1' data-id='JG5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, made this song, saying: </span>
<span class='v JG5_2' data-id='JG5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Because of the flowing hair of the fighters in Israel, because the people gave themselves freely, give praise to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JG5_3' data-id='JG5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Give attention, O kings; give ear, O rulers; I, even I, will make a song to the Lord; I will make melody to the Lord, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG5_4' data-id='JG5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Lord, when you went out from Seir, moving like an army from the field of Edom, the earth was shaking and the heavens were troubled, and the clouds were dropping water. </span>
<span class='v JG5_5' data-id='JG5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The mountains were shaking before the Lord, before the Lord, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG5_6' data-id='JG5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were not used, and travellers went by side roads. </span>
<span class='v JG5_7' data-id='JG5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Country towns were no more in Israel, ***were no more, till you, Deborah, came up, till you came up as a mother in Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG5_8' data-id='JG5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They had no one to make arms, there were no more armed men in the towns; was there a body-cover or a spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel? </span>
<span class='v JG5_9' data-id='JG5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Come, you rulers of Israel, you who gave yourselves freely among the people: give praise to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JG5_10' data-id='JG5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let them give thought to it, who go on white asses, and those who are walking on the road. </span>
<span class='v JG5_11' data-id='JG5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Give ear to the women laughing by the water-springs; there they will give again the story of the upright acts of the Lord, all the upright acts of his arm in Israel. </span>
<span class='v JG5_12' data-id='JG5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Awake! awake! Deborah: awake! awake! give a song: Up! Barak, and take prisoner those who took you prisoner, O son of Abinoam. </span>
<span class='v JG5_13' data-id='JG5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the chiefs went down to the doors; the Lord's people went down among the strong ones. </span>
<span class='v JG5_14' data-id='JG5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Out of Ephraim they came down into the valley; after you, Benjamin, among your tribesmen; from Machir came down the captains, and from Zebulun those in whose hand is the ruler's rod. </span>
<span class='v JG5_15' data-id='JG5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Your chiefs, Issachar, were with Deborah; and Naphtali was true to Barak; into the valley they went rushing out at his feet. In Reuben there were divisions, and great searchings of heart. </span>
<span class='v JG5_16' data-id='JG5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Why did you keep quiet among the sheep, hearing nothing but the watchers piping to the flocks? </span>
<span class='v JG5_17' data-id='JG5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Gilead was living over Jordan; and Dan was waiting in his ships; Asher kept in his place by the sea's edge, living by his inlets. </span>
<span class='v JG5_18' data-id='JG5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It was the people of Zebulun who put their lives in danger, even to death, with Naphtali on the high places of the field. </span>
<span class='v JG5_19' data-id='JG5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The kings came on to the fight, the kings of Canaan were warring; in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they took no profit in money. </span>
<span class='v JG5_20' data-id='JG5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The stars from heaven were fighting; from their highways they were fighting against Sisera. </span>
<span class='v JG5_21' data-id='JG5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The river Kishon took them violently away, stopping their flight, the river Kishon. Give praise, O my soul, to the strength of the Lord! </span>
<span class='v JG5_22' data-id='JG5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then loudly the feet of the horses were sounding with the stamping, the stamping of their war-horses. </span>
<span class='v JG5_23' data-id='JG5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>A curse, a curse on Meroz! said the angel of the Lord. A bitter curse on her townspeople! Because they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord among the strong ones. </span>
<span class='v JG5_24' data-id='JG5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Blessings be on Jael, more than on all women! Blessings greater than on any in the tents! </span>
<span class='v JG5_25' data-id='JG5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>His request was for water, she gave him milk; she put butter before him on a fair plate. </span>
<span class='v JG5_26' data-id='JG5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>She put out her hand to the tent-pin, and her right hand to the workman's hammer; and she gave Sisera a blow, crushing his head, wounding and driving through his brow. </span>
<span class='v JG5_27' data-id='JG5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Bent at her feet he went down, he was stretched out; bent at her feet he went down; where he was bent down, there he went down in death. </span>
<span class='v JG5_28' data-id='JG5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Looking out from the window she gave a cry, the mother of Sisera was crying out through the window, Why is his carriage so long in coming? When will the noise of his wheels be sounding? </span>
<span class='v JG5_29' data-id='JG5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Her wise women gave answer to her, yes, she made answer again to herself, </span>
<span class='v JG5_30' data-id='JG5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Are they not getting, are they not parting the goods among them: a young girl or two to every man; and to Sisera robes of coloured needlework, worked in fair colours on this side and on that, for the neck of the queen? </span>
<span class='v JG5_31' data-id='JG5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So may destruction come on all your haters, O Lord; but let your lovers be like the sun going out in his strength. And for forty years the land had peace. </span></div></div>
