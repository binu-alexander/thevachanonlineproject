<span class='v K19_1' data-id='K19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when Solomon came to the end of building the house of the Lord and the king's house, and all Solomon's desires, which he had in mind were effected; </span>
<span class='v K19_2' data-id='K19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Lord came to him again in a vision, as he had done at Gibeon; </span>
<span class='v K19_3' data-id='K19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to him, Your prayers and your requests for grace have come to my ears: I have made holy this house which you have made, and I have put my name there for ever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times. </span>
<span class='v K19_4' data-id='K19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As for you, if you will go on your way before me, as David your father did, uprightly and with a true heart, doing what I have given you orders to do, keeping my laws and my decisions; </span>
<span class='v K19_5' data-id='K19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then I will make the seat of your rule over Israel certain for ever, as I gave my word to David your father, saying, You will never be without a man to be king in Israel. </span>
<span class='v K19_6' data-id='K19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if you are turned from my ways, you or your children, and do not keep my orders and my laws which I have put before you, but go and make yourselves servants to other gods and give them worship: </span>
<span class='v K19_7' data-id='K19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I will have Israel cut off from the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have made holy for myself, I will put away from before my eyes; and Israel will be a public example, and a word of shame among all peoples. </span>
<span class='v K19_8' data-id='K19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And this house will become a mass of broken walls, and everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder at it and make whistling sounds; and they will say, Why has the Lord done so to this land and to this house? </span>
<span class='v K19_9' data-id='K19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And their answer will be, Because they were turned away from the Lord their God, who took their fathers out of the land of Egypt; they took for themselves other gods and gave them worship and became their servants: that is why the Lord has sent all this evil on them. </span>
<span class='v K19_10' data-id='K19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now at the end of twenty years, in which time Solomon had put up the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's house, </span>
<span class='v K19_11' data-id='K19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>(Hiram, king of Tyre, had given Solomon cedar-trees and cypress-trees and gold, as much as he had need of,) King Solomon gave Hiram twenty towns in the land of Galilee. </span>
<span class='v K19_12' data-id='K19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns which Solomon had given him, he was not pleased with them. </span>
<span class='v K19_13' data-id='K19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he said, What sort of towns are these which you have given me, my brother? So they were named the land of Cabul, to this day. </span>
<span class='v K19_14' data-id='K19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Hiram sent the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold. </span>
<span class='v K19_15' data-id='K19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now, this was the way of Solomon's system of forced work for the building of the Lord's house and of the king's house, and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Megiddo and Gezer. ... </span>
<span class='v K19_16' data-id='K19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Pharaoh, king of Egypt, came and took Gezer, burning it down and putting to death the Canaanites living in the town, and he gave it for a bride-offering to his daughter, Solomon's wife. ... </span>
<span class='v K19_17' data-id='K19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> ... and Solomon was the builder of Gezer and Beth-horon the lower, </span>
<span class='v K19_18' data-id='K19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Baalath and Tamar in the waste land, in that land; </span>
<span class='v K19_19' data-id='K19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And all the store-towns and the towns which Solomon had for his war-carriages and for his horsemen, and everything which it was his pleasure to put up in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land under his rule. </span>
<span class='v K19_20' data-id='K19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As for the rest of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not children of Israel; </span>
<span class='v K19_21' data-id='K19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Their children who were still in the land, and whom the children of Israel had not been able to put to complete destruction, them did Solomon put to forced work, to this day. </span>
<span class='v K19_22' data-id='K19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Solomon did not put the children of Israel to forced work; they were the men of war, his servants, his captains, and his chiefs, captains of his war-carriages and of his horsemen. </span>
<span class='v K19_23' data-id='K19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>These were the chiefs of the overseers of Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, in authority over the people who did the work. </span>
<span class='v K19_24' data-id='K19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>At that time Solomon made Pharaoh's daughter come up from the town of David to the house which he had made for her: then he made the Millo. </span>
<span class='v K19_25' data-id='K19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Three times in the year it was Solomon's way to give burned offerings and peace-offerings on the altar he had made to the Lord, causing his fire-offering to go up on the altar before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v K19_26' data-id='K19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon made a sea-force of ships in Ezion-geber, by Eloth, on the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. </span>
<span class='v K19_27' data-id='K19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Hiram sent his servants, who were experienced seamen, in the sea-force with Solomon's men. </span>
<span class='v K19_28' data-id='K19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they came to Ophir, where they got four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and took it back to King Solomon. </span></div></div>
