<span class='v AC9_1' data-id='AC9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But Saul, still burning with desire to put to death the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest, </span>
<span class='v AC9_2' data-id='AC9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And made a request for letters from him to the Synagogues of Damascus, so that if there were any of the Way there, men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v AC9_3' data-id='AC9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And while he was journeying, he came near Damascus; and suddenly he saw a light from heaven shining round him; </span>
<span class='v AC9_4' data-id='AC9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he went down on the earth, and a voice said to him, Saul, Saul, why are you attacking me so cruelly? </span>
<span class='v AC9_5' data-id='AC9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are attacking: </span>
<span class='v AC9_6' data-id='AC9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But get up, and go into the town, and it will be made clear to you what you have to do. </span>
<span class='v AC9_7' data-id='AC9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the men who were with him were not able to say anything; hearing the voice, but seeing no one. </span>
<span class='v AC9_8' data-id='AC9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Saul got up from the earth, and when his eyes were open, he saw nothing; and he was guided by the hand into Damascus. </span>
<span class='v AC9_9' data-id='AC9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And for three days he was not able to see, and he took no food or drink. </span>
<span class='v AC9_10' data-id='AC9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! and he said, Here I am, Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC9_11' data-id='AC9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to him, Get up, and go to the street which is named Straight, and make search at the house of Judas for one named Saul of Tarsus: for he is at prayer; </span>
<span class='v AC9_12' data-id='AC9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hands on him, so that he may be able to see. </span>
<span class='v AC9_13' data-id='AC9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But Ananias said, Lord, I have had accounts of this man from a number of people, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem: </span>
<span class='v AC9_14' data-id='AC9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And here he has authority from the chief priests to make prisoners all who give worship to your name. </span>
<span class='v AC9_15' data-id='AC9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the Lord said, Go without fear: for he is a special vessel for me, to give to the Gentiles and kings and to the children of Israel the knowledge of my name: </span>
<span class='v AC9_16' data-id='AC9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For I will make clear to him what troubles he will have to undergo for me. </span>
<span class='v AC9_17' data-id='AC9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Ananias went out and came to the house, and putting his hands on him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, whom you saw when you were on your journey, has sent me, so that you may be able to see, and be full of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC9_18' data-id='AC9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And straight away it seemed as if a veil was taken from his eyes, and he was able to see; and he got up, and had baptism; </span>
<span class='v AC9_19' data-id='AC9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken food his strength came back. And for some days he kept with the disciples who were in Damascus. </span>
<span class='v AC9_20' data-id='AC9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And straight away, in the Synagogues, he was preaching Jesus as the Son of God. </span>
<span class='v AC9_21' data-id='AC9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And all those hearing him were full of wonder and said, Is not this the man who in Jerusalem was attacking all the worshippers of this name? and he had come here so that he might take them as prisoners before the chief priests. </span>
<span class='v AC9_22' data-id='AC9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Saul went on increasing in power, and the Jews in Damascus were not able to give answers to the arguments by which he made it clear that Jesus was the Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC9_23' data-id='AC9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then, after some days, the Jews made an agreement together to put him to death: </span>
<span class='v AC9_24' data-id='AC9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But Saul got knowledge of their design. And they kept watch day and night on the roads out of the town, so that they might put him to death: </span>
<span class='v AC9_25' data-id='AC9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But his disciples took him by night and let him down from the wall in a basket. </span>
<span class='v AC9_26' data-id='AC9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And when he came to Jerusalem, he made an attempt to be joined to the disciples, but they were all in fear of him, not taking him for a disciple. </span>
<span class='v AC9_27' data-id='AC9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But Barnabas took him to the Apostles and gave them an account of how he had seen the Lord on the road, and had given hearing to his words, and how at Damascus he had been preaching in the name of Jesus without fear. </span>
<span class='v AC9_28' data-id='AC9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he was with them, going in and out at Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v AC9_29' data-id='AC9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Preaching in the name of the Lord without fear; and he had discussions with the Greek Jews; but they were working for his death. </span>
<span class='v AC9_30' data-id='AC9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And when the brothers had knowledge of it, they took him to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus. </span>
<span class='v AC9_31' data-id='AC9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And so the church through all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was made strong; and, living in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was increased greatly. </span>
<span class='v AC9_32' data-id='AC9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And it came about that while Peter was going through all parts of the country he came to the saints who were living at Lydda. </span>
<span class='v AC9_33' data-id='AC9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And there was a certain man there, named Aeneas, who for eight years had been in bed, without power of moving. </span>
<span class='v AC9_34' data-id='AC9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ makes you well: get up and make your bed. And straight away he got up. </span>
<span class='v AC9_35' data-id='AC9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And all those living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and were turned to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC9_36' data-id='AC9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, that is, Dorcas: this woman was given to good works and acts of mercy at all times. </span>
<span class='v AC9_37' data-id='AC9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And it came about, in those days, that she got ill and came to her death: and when she had been washed, they put her in a room which was high up. </span>
<span class='v AC9_38' data-id='AC9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having knowledge that Peter was there, sent two men to him, requesting him to come to them straight away. </span>
<span class='v AC9_39' data-id='AC9_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And Peter went with them. And when he had come, they took him into the room: and all the widows were there, weeping and putting before him the coats and clothing which Dorcas had made while she was with them. </span>
<span class='v AC9_40' data-id='AC9_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But Peter made them all go outside, and went down on his knees in prayer; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, get up. And, opening her eyes, she saw Peter and got up. </span>
<span class='v AC9_41' data-id='AC9_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And he took her hand, lifting her up; and, sending for the saints and widows, he gave her to them, living. </span>
<span class='v AC9_42' data-id='AC9_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And news of it went all through Joppa, and a number of people had faith in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC9_43' data-id='AC9_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And he was living in Joppa for some time with Simon, a leather-worker. </span></div></div>
