<span class='v EK45_7' data-id='EK45_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And for the ruler there is to be a part on one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the property of the town, in front of the holy offering and in front of the property of the town on the west of it and on the east: measured in the same line as one of the parts of the land, from its limit on the west to its limit on the east of the land. </span>
<span class='v EK45_8' data-id='EK45_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And this will be his heritage in Israel: and my rulers will no longer be cruel masters to my people; but they will give the land as a heritage to the children of Israel by their tribes. </span>
