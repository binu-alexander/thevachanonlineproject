<span class='v IS22_2' data-id='IS22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You, who are full of loud voices, a town of outcries, given up to joy; your dead men have not been put to the sword, or come to their death in war. </span>
<span class='v IS22_3' data-id='IS22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All your rulers ... have gone in flight; all your strong ones have gone far away. </span>
<span class='v IS22_4' data-id='IS22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For this cause I have said, Let your eyes be turned away from me in my bitter weeping; I will not be comforted for the wasting of the daughter of my people. </span>
<span class='v IS22_5' data-id='IS22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For it is a day of trouble and of crushing down and of destruction from the Lord, the Lord of armies, in the valley of vision; ... </span>
<span class='v IS22_6' data-id='IS22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Elam was armed with arrows, and Aram came on horseback; and the breastplate of Kir was uncovered. </span>
<span class='v IS22_7' data-id='IS22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And your most fertile valleys were full of war-carriages, and the horsemen took up their positions in front of the town. </span>
<span class='v IS22_8' data-id='IS22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He took away the cover of Judah; and in that day you were looking with care at the store of arms in the house of the woods. </span>
<span class='v IS22_9' data-id='IS22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And you saw all the broken places in the wall of the town of David: and you got together the waters of the lower pool. </span>
<span class='v IS22_10' data-id='IS22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And you had the houses of Jerusalem numbered, pulling down the houses to make the wall stronger. </span>
<span class='v IS22_11' data-id='IS22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And you made a place between the two walls for storing the waters of the old pool: but you gave no thought to him who had done this, and were not looking to him by whom it had been purposed long before. </span>
<span class='v IS22_12' data-id='IS22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And in that day the Lord, the Lord of armies, was looking for weeping, and cries of sorrow, cutting off of the hair, and putting on the clothing of grief: </span>
<span class='v IS22_13' data-id='IS22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But in place of these there was joy and delight, oxen and sheep were being made ready for food, there was feasting and drinking: men said, Now is the time for food and wine, for tomorrow death comes. </span>
<span class='v IS22_14' data-id='IS22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the Lord of armies said to me secretly, Truly, this sin will not be taken from you till your death, says the Lord, the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v IS22_15' data-id='IS22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The Lord, the Lord of armies, says, Go to this person in authority, this Shebna, who is over the house; who has made himself a resting-place on high, cutting out a place for himself in the rock, and say, </span>
<span class='v IS22_16' data-id='IS22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Who are you, and by what right have you made for yourself a resting-place here? </span>
<span class='v IS22_17' data-id='IS22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>See, O strong man, the Lord will send you violently away, gripping you with force, </span>
<span class='v IS22_18' data-id='IS22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Twisting you round and round like a ball he will send you out into a wide country: there you will come to your end, and there will be the carriages of your pride, O shame of your lord's house! </span>
<span class='v IS22_19' data-id='IS22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I will have you forced out of your place of authority, and pulled down from your position. </span>
<span class='v IS22_20' data-id='IS22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And in that day I will send for my servant, Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah: </span>
<span class='v IS22_21' data-id='IS22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And I will put your robe on him, and put your band about him, and I will give your authority into his hand: and he will be a father to the men of Jerusalem, and to the family of Judah. </span>
<span class='v IS22_22' data-id='IS22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I will give the key of the family of David into his care; and what he keeps open will be shut by no one, and what he keeps shut no one will make open. </span>
<span class='v IS22_23' data-id='IS22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And I will put him like a nail in a safe place; and he will be for a seat of glory to his father's family. </span>
<span class='v IS22_24' data-id='IS22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And all the glory of his father's family will be hanging on him, all their offspring, every small vessel, even the cups and the basins. </span>
<span class='v IS22_25' data-id='IS22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In that day, says the Lord of armies, will the nail fixed in a safe place give way; and it will be cut down, and in its fall the weight hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has said it. </span></div></div>
