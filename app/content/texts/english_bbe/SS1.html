<span class='v SS1_1' data-id='SS1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The song of Songs, which is Solomon's. </span>
<span class='v SS1_2' data-id='SS1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Let him give me the kisses of his mouth: for his love is better than wine. </span>
<span class='v SS1_3' data-id='SS1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Sweet is the smell of your perfumes; your name is as perfume running out; so the young girls give you their love. </span>
<span class='v SS1_4' data-id='SS1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Take me to you, and we will go after you: the king has taken me into his house. We will be glad and full of joy in you, we will give more thought to your love than to wine: rightly are they your lovers. </span>
<span class='v SS1_5' data-id='SS1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I am dark, but fair of form, O daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon. </span>
<span class='v SS1_6' data-id='SS1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let not your eyes be turned on me, because I am dark, because I was looked on by the sun; my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vine-gardens; but my vine-garden I have not kept. </span>
<span class='v SS1_7' data-id='SS1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Say, O love of my soul, where you give food to your flock, and where you make them take their rest in the heat of the day; why have I to be as one wandering by the flocks of your friends? </span>
<span class='v SS1_8' data-id='SS1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you have not knowledge, O most beautiful among women, go on your way in the footsteps of the flock, and give your young goats food by the tents of the keepers. </span>
<span class='v SS1_9' data-id='SS1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I have made a comparison of you, O my love, to a horse in Pharaoh's carriages. </span>
<span class='v SS1_10' data-id='SS1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Your face is a delight with rings of hair, your neck with chains of jewels. </span>
<span class='v SS1_11' data-id='SS1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>We will make you chains of gold with ornaments of silver. </span>
<span class='v SS1_12' data-id='SS1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>While the king is seated at his table, my spices send out their perfume. </span>
<span class='v SS1_13' data-id='SS1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As a bag of myrrh is my well-loved one to me, when he is at rest all night between my breasts. </span>
<span class='v SS1_14' data-id='SS1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>My love is to me as a branch of the cypress-tree in the vine-gardens of En-gedi. </span>
<span class='v SS1_15' data-id='SS1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>See, you are fair, my love, you are fair; you have the eyes of a dove. </span>
<span class='v SS1_16' data-id='SS1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>See, you are fair, my loved one, and a pleasure; our bed is green. </span>
<span class='v SS1_17' data-id='SS1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Cedar-trees are the pillars of our house; and our boards are made of fir-trees. </span></div></div>
