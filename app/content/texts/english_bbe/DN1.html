<span class='v DN1_1' data-id='DN1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the third year of the rule of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem, shutting it in with his forces. </span>
<span class='v DN1_2' data-id='DN1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord gave into his hands Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with some of the vessels of the house of God; and he took them away into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he put the vessels into the store-house of his god. </span>
<span class='v DN1_3' data-id='DN1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the king gave orders to Ashpenaz, the captain of his unsexed servants, to take in some of the children of Israel, certain of the king's family, and those of high birth; </span>
<span class='v DN1_4' data-id='DN1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Young men who were strong and healthy, good-looking, and trained in all wisdom, having a good education and much knowledge, and able to take positions in the king's house; and to have them trained in the writing and language of the Chaldaeans. </span>
<span class='v DN1_5' data-id='DN1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And a regular amount of food and wine every day from the king's table was ordered for them by the king; and they were to be cared for for three years so that at the end of that time they might take their places before the king. </span>
<span class='v DN1_6' data-id='DN1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And among these there were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. </span>
<span class='v DN1_7' data-id='DN1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the captain of the unsexed servants gave them names; to Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar, to Hananiah the name of Shadrach, to Mishael the name of Meshach, and to Azariah the name of Abed-nego. </span>
<span class='v DN1_8' data-id='DN1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Daniel had come to the decision that he would not make himself unclean with the king's food or wine; so he made a request to the captain of the unsexed servants that he might not make himself unclean. </span>
<span class='v DN1_9' data-id='DN1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And God put into the heart of the captain of the unsexed servants kind feelings and pity for Daniel. </span>
<span class='v DN1_10' data-id='DN1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the captain of the unsexed servants said to Daniel, I am in fear of my lord the king, who has given orders about your food and your drink; what if he sees you looking less happy than the other young men of your generation? then you would have put my head in danger from the king. </span>
<span class='v DN1_11' data-id='DN1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Daniel said to the keeper in whose care the captain of the unsexed servants had put Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: </span>
<span class='v DN1_12' data-id='DN1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Put your servants to the test for ten days; let them give us grain for our food and water for our drink. </span>
<span class='v DN1_13' data-id='DN1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then take a look at our faces and the faces of the young men who have food from the king's table; and, having seen them, do to your servants as it seems right to you. </span>
<span class='v DN1_14' data-id='DN1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So he gave ear to them in this thing and put them to the test for ten days. </span>
<span class='v DN1_15' data-id='DN1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And at the end of ten days their faces seemed fairer and they were fatter in flesh than all the young men who had their food from the king's table. </span>
<span class='v DN1_16' data-id='DN1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So the keeper regularly took away their meat and the wine which was to have been their drink, and gave them grain. </span>
<span class='v DN1_17' data-id='DN1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now as for these four young men, God gave them knowledge and made them expert in all book-learning and wisdom: and Daniel was wise in all visions and dreams. </span>
<span class='v DN1_18' data-id='DN1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now at the end of the time fixed by the king for them to go in, the captain of the unsexed servants took them in to Nebuchadnezzar. </span>
<span class='v DN1_19' data-id='DN1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the king had talk with them; and among them all there was no one like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they were given places before the king. </span>
<span class='v DN1_20' data-id='DN1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And in any business needing wisdom and good sense, about which the king put questions to them, he saw that they were ten times better than all the wonder-workers and users of secret arts in all his kingdom. </span>
<span class='v DN1_21' data-id='DN1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Daniel went on till the first year of King Cyrus. </span></div></div>
