<span class='v JB27_1' data-id='JB27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job again took up the word and said, </span>
<span class='v JB27_2' data-id='JB27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By the life of God, who has taken away my right; and of the Ruler of all, who has made my soul bitter; </span>
<span class='v JB27_3' data-id='JB27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>(For all my breath is still in me, and the spirit of God is my life;) </span>
<span class='v JB27_4' data-id='JB27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Truly, there is no deceit in my lips, and my tongue does not say what is false. </span>
<span class='v JB27_5' data-id='JB27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let it be far from me! I will certainly not say that you are right! I will come to death before I give up my righteousness. </span>
<span class='v JB27_6' data-id='JB27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will keep it safe, and will not let it go: my heart has nothing to say against any part of my life. </span>
<span class='v JB27_7' data-id='JB27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Let my hater be like the evil man, and let him who comes against me be as the sinner. </span>
<span class='v JB27_8' data-id='JB27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For what is the hope of the sinner when he is cut off, when God takes back his soul? </span>
<span class='v JB27_9' data-id='JB27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Will his cry come to the ears of God when he is in trouble? </span>
<span class='v JB27_10' data-id='JB27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Will he take delight in the Ruler of all, and make his prayer to God at all times? </span>
<span class='v JB27_11' data-id='JB27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I will give you teaching about the hand of God; I will not keep secret from you what is in the mind of the Ruler of all. </span>
<span class='v JB27_12' data-id='JB27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Truly, you have all seen it yourselves; why then have you become completely foolish? </span>
<span class='v JB27_13' data-id='JB27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is the punishment of the evil-doer from God, and the heritage given to the cruel by the Ruler of all. </span>
<span class='v JB27_14' data-id='JB27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If his children are increased, it is for the sword; and his offspring have not enough bread. </span>
<span class='v JB27_15' data-id='JB27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When those of his house who are still living come to their end by disease, they are not put into the earth, and their widows are not weeping for them. </span>
<span class='v JB27_16' data-id='JB27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Though he may get silver together like dust, and make ready great stores of clothing; </span>
<span class='v JB27_17' data-id='JB27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He may get them ready, but the upright will put them on, and he who is free from sin will take the silver for a heritage. </span>
<span class='v JB27_18' data-id='JB27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>His house has no more strength than a spider's thread, or a watchman's tent. </span>
<span class='v JB27_19' data-id='JB27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He goes to rest full of wealth, but does so for the last time: on opening his eyes, he sees it there no longer. </span>
<span class='v JB27_20' data-id='JB27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Fears overtake him like rushing waters; in the night the storm-wind takes him away. </span>
<span class='v JB27_21' data-id='JB27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The east wind takes him up and he is gone; he is forced violently out of his place. </span>
<span class='v JB27_22' data-id='JB27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>God sends his arrows against him without mercy; he goes in flight before his hand. </span>
<span class='v JB27_23' data-id='JB27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Men make signs of joy because of him, driving him from his place with sounds of hissing. </span></div></div>
