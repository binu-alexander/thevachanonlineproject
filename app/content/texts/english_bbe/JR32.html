<span class='v JR32_1' data-id='JR32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. </span>
<span class='v JR32_2' data-id='JR32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was round Jerusalem, shutting it in: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, in the house of the king of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR32_3' data-id='JR32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Zedekiah, king of Judah, had had him shut up, saying, Why have you, as a prophet, been saying, The Lord has said, See, I will give this town into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will take it; </span>
<span class='v JR32_4' data-id='JR32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah, king of Judah, will not get away from the hands of the Chaldaeans, but will certainly be given up into the hands of the king of Babylon, and will have talk with him, mouth to mouth, and see him, eye to eye. </span>
<span class='v JR32_5' data-id='JR32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he will take Zedekiah away to Babylon, where he will be till I have pity on him, says the Lord: though you are fighting with the Chaldaeans, things will not go well for you? </span>
<span class='v JR32_6' data-id='JR32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Jeremiah said, The word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR32_7' data-id='JR32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>See, Hanamel, the son of Shallum, your father's brother, will come to you and say, Give the price and get for yourself my property in Anathoth: for you have the right of the nearest relation. </span>
<span class='v JR32_8' data-id='JR32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, came to me, as the Lord had said, to the place of the armed watchmen, and said to me, Give the price and get my property which is in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: for you have the nearest relation's right to the heritage; so get it for yourself. Then it was clear to me that this was the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR32_9' data-id='JR32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So I got for a price the property in Anathoth from Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and gave him the money, seventeen shekels of silver; </span>
<span class='v JR32_10' data-id='JR32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I put it in writing, stamping it with my stamp, and I took witnesses and put the money into the scales. </span>
<span class='v JR32_11' data-id='JR32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So I took the paper witnessing the business, one copy rolled up and stamped, and one copy open: </span>
<span class='v JR32_12' data-id='JR32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I gave the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, before the eyes of Hanamel, the son of my father's brother, and of the witnesses who had put their names to the paper, and before all the Jews who were seated in the place of the armed watchmen. </span>
<span class='v JR32_13' data-id='JR32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I gave orders to Baruch in front of them, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR32_14' data-id='JR32_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Take these papers, the witness of this business, the one which is rolled up and stamped, and the one which is open; and put them in a vessel of earth so that they may be kept for a long time. </span>
<span class='v JR32_15' data-id='JR32_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said, There will again be trading in houses and fields and vine-gardens in this land. </span>
<span class='v JR32_16' data-id='JR32_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now after I had given the paper to Baruch, the son of Neriah, I made my prayer to the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR32_17' data-id='JR32_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Ah Lord God! see, you have made the heaven and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm, and there is nothing you are not able to do: </span>
<span class='v JR32_18' data-id='JR32_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>You have mercy on thousands, and send punishment for the evil-doing of the fathers on their children after them: the great, the strong God, the Lord of armies is his name: </span>
<span class='v JR32_19' data-id='JR32_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Great in wisdom and strong in act: whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men, giving to everyone the reward of his ways and the fruit of his doings: </span>
<span class='v JR32_20' data-id='JR32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You have done signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, and even to this day, in Israel and among other men; and have made a name for yourself as at this day; </span>
<span class='v JR32_21' data-id='JR32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And have taken your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, causing great fear; </span>
<span class='v JR32_22' data-id='JR32_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And have given them this land, which you gave your word to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; </span>
<span class='v JR32_23' data-id='JR32_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And they came in and took it for their heritage, but they did not give ear to your voice, and were not ruled by your law; they have done nothing of all you gave them orders to do: so you have made all this evil come on them: </span>
<span class='v JR32_24' data-id='JR32_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>See, they have made earthworks against the town to take it; and the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans who are fighting against it, because of the sword and need of food and disease: and what you have said has taken place, and truly you see it. </span>
<span class='v JR32_25' data-id='JR32_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And you have said to me, Give the money to get yourself a property, and have the business witnessed; though the town is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans. </span>
<span class='v JR32_26' data-id='JR32_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR32_27' data-id='JR32_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>See, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything so hard that I am unable to do it? </span>
<span class='v JR32_28' data-id='JR32_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So this is what the Lord has said: See, I am giving this town into the hands of the Chaldaeans and into the hands of Nebuchadrezzar, the king of Babylon, and he will take it: </span>
<span class='v JR32_29' data-id='JR32_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the Chaldaeans, who are fighting against this town, will come and put the town on fire, burning it together with the houses, on the roofs of which perfumes have been burned to the Baal, and drink offerings have been drained out to other gods, moving me to wrath. </span>
<span class='v JR32_30' data-id='JR32_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done nothing but evil in my eyes from their earliest years: the children of Israel have only made me angry with the work of their hands, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR32_31' data-id='JR32_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For this town has been to me a cause of wrath and of burning passion from the day of its building till this day, so that I put it away from before my face: </span>
<span class='v JR32_32' data-id='JR32_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to make me angry, they and their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR32_33' data-id='JR32_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And they have been turning their backs and not their faces to me: and though I was their teacher, getting up early and teaching them, their ears were not open to teaching. </span>
<span class='v JR32_34' data-id='JR32_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But they put their disgusting images into the house which is named by my name, making it unclean. </span>
<span class='v JR32_35' data-id='JR32_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And they put up the high places of the Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, making their sons and their daughters go through the fire to Molech; which I did not give them orders to do, and it never came into my mind that they would do this disgusting thing, causing Judah to be turned out of the way. </span>
<span class='v JR32_36' data-id='JR32_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And now the Lord, the God of Israel, has said of this town, about which you say, It is given into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword and by need of food and by disease: </span>
<span class='v JR32_37' data-id='JR32_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>See, I will get them together from all the countries where I have sent them in my wrath and in the heat of my passion and in my bitter feeling; and I will let them come back into this place where they may take their rest safely. </span>
<span class='v JR32_38' data-id='JR32_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And they will be my people, and I will be their God: </span>
<span class='v JR32_39' data-id='JR32_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And I will give them one heart and one way, so that they may go on in the worship of me for ever, for their good and the good of their children after them: </span>
<span class='v JR32_40' data-id='JR32_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And I will make an eternal agreement with them, that I will never give them up, but ever do them good; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, so that they will not go away from me. </span>
<span class='v JR32_41' data-id='JR32_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And truly, I will take pleasure in doing them good, and all my heart and soul will be given to planting them in this land in good faith. </span>
<span class='v JR32_42' data-id='JR32_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For the Lord has said: As I have made all this great evil come on this people, so I will send on them all the good which I said about them. </span>
<span class='v JR32_43' data-id='JR32_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And there will be trading in fields in this land of which you say, It is a waste, without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldaeans. </span>
<span class='v JR32_44' data-id='JR32_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Men will get fields for money, and put the business in writing, stamping the papers and having them witnessed, in the land of Benjamin and in the country round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah and in the towns of the hill-country and in the towns of the lowland and in the towns of the South: for I will let their fate be changed, says the Lord. </span></div></div>
