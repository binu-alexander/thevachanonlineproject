<span class='v GL5_1' data-id='GL5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again. </span>
<span class='v GL5_2' data-id='GL5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you. </span>
<span class='v GL5_3' data-id='GL5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_4' data-id='GL5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace. </span>
<span class='v GL5_5' data-id='GL5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness. </span>
<span class='v GL5_6' data-id='GL5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love. </span>
<span class='v GL5_7' data-id='GL5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true? </span>
<span class='v GL5_8' data-id='GL5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his. </span>
<span class='v GL5_9' data-id='GL5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>A little leaven makes a change in all the mass. </span>
<span class='v GL5_10' data-id='GL5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is. </span>
<span class='v GL5_11' data-id='GL5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away. </span>
<span class='v GL5_12' data-id='GL5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves. </span>
<span class='v GL5_13' data-id='GL5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another. </span>
<span class='v GL5_14' data-id='GL5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. </span>
<span class='v GL5_15' data-id='GL5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another. </span>
<span class='v GL5_16' data-id='GL5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh. </span>
<span class='v GL5_17' data-id='GL5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do. </span>
<span class='v GL5_18' data-id='GL5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_19' data-id='GL5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses, </span>
<span class='v GL5_20' data-id='GL5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings, </span>
<span class='v GL5_21' data-id='GL5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v GL5_22' data-id='GL5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith, </span>
<span class='v GL5_23' data-id='GL5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law. </span>
<span class='v GL5_24' data-id='GL5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And those who are Christ's have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires. </span>
<span class='v GL5_25' data-id='GL5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided. </span>
<span class='v GL5_26' data-id='GL5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another. </span></div></div>
