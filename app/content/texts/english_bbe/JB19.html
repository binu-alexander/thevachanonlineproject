<span class='v JB19_3' data-id='JB19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Ten times now you have made sport of me; it gives you no sense of shame to do me wrong. </span>
<span class='v JB19_4' data-id='JB19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And, truly, if I have been in error, the effect of my error is only on myself. </span>
<span class='v JB19_5' data-id='JB19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If you make yourselves great against me, using my punishment as an argument against me, </span>

<span class='v JB19_7' data-id='JB19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Truly, I make an outcry against the violent man, but there is no answer: I give a cry for help, but no one takes up my cause. </span>
<span class='v JB19_8' data-id='JB19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>My way is walled up by him so that I may not go by: he has made my roads dark. </span>
<span class='v JB19_9' data-id='JB19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He has put off my glory from me, and taken the crown from my head. </span>
