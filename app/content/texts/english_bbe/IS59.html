<span class='v IS59_1' data-id='IS59_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Truly, the Lord's hand has not become short, so that he is unable to give salvation; and his ear is not shut from hearing: </span>
<span class='v IS59_2' data-id='IS59_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But your sins have come between you and your God, and by your evil doings his face has been veiled from you, so that he will give you no answer. </span>
<span class='v IS59_3' data-id='IS59_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For your hands are unclean with blood, and your fingers with sin; your lips have said false things, and your tongue gives out deceit. </span>
<span class='v IS59_4' data-id='IS59_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>No one puts forward an upright cause, or gives a true decision: their hope is in deceit, and their words are false; they are with child with sin, and give birth to evil. </span>
<span class='v IS59_5' data-id='IS59_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They give birth to snake's eggs, and make spider's threads: whoever takes their eggs for food comes to his death, and the egg which is crushed becomes a poison-snake. </span>
<span class='v IS59_6' data-id='IS59_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Their twisted threads will not make clothing, and their works will give them nothing for covering themselves: their works are works of sin, and violent acts are in their hands. </span>
<span class='v IS59_7' data-id='IS59_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Their feet go quickly to evil, and they take delight in the death of the upright; their thoughts are thoughts of sin; wasting and destruction are in their ways. </span>
<span class='v IS59_8' data-id='IS59_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They have no knowledge of the way of peace, and there is no sense of what is right in their behaviour: they have made for themselves ways which are not straight; whoever goes in them has no knowledge of peace. </span>
<span class='v IS59_9' data-id='IS59_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this cause our right is far from us, and righteousness does not overtake us: we are looking for light, but there is only the dark; for the shining of the sun, but our way is in the night. </span>
<span class='v IS59_10' data-id='IS59_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>We go on our way, like blind men feeling for the wall, even like those who have no eyes: we are running against things in daylight as if it was evening; our place is in the dark like dead men. </span>
<span class='v IS59_11' data-id='IS59_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>We make noises of grief, like bears, and sad sounds like doves: we are looking for our right, but it is not there; for salvation, but it is far from us. </span>
<span class='v IS59_12' data-id='IS59_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For our evil doings are increased before you, and our sins give witness against us: for our evil doings are with us, and we have knowledge of our sins: </span>
<span class='v IS59_13' data-id='IS59_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>We have gone against the Lord, and been false to him, turning away from our God, our words have been uncontrolled, and in our hearts are thoughts of deceit. </span>
<span class='v IS59_14' data-id='IS59_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the right is turned back, and righteousness is far away: for good faith is not to be seen in the public places, and upright behaviour may not come into the town. </span>
<span class='v IS59_15' data-id='IS59_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yes, faith is gone; and he whose heart is turned from evil comes into the power of the cruel: and the Lord saw it, and he was angry that there was no one to take up their cause. </span>
<span class='v IS59_16' data-id='IS59_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he saw that there was no man, and was surprised that there was no one to take up their cause: so his arm gave salvation, and he made righteousness his support. </span>
<span class='v IS59_17' data-id='IS59_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Yes, he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and salvation as a head-dress; and he put on punishment as clothing, and wrath as a robe. </span>
<span class='v IS59_18' data-id='IS59_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He will give them the right reward of their doings, wrath to his attackers, punishment to his haters, and even on the sea-lands he will send punishment. </span>
<span class='v IS59_19' data-id='IS59_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So they will see the name of the Lord from the west, and his glory from the east: for he will come like a rushing stream, forced on by a wind of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS59_20' data-id='IS59_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And as a saviour he will come to Zion, turning away sin from Jacob, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS59_21' data-id='IS59_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And as for me, this is my agreement with them, says the Lord: my spirit which is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not go away from your mouth, or from the mouth of your seed, or from the mouth of your seed's seed, says the Lord, from now and for ever. </span></div></div>
