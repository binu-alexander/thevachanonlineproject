<span class='v JB7_1' data-id='JB7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Has not man his ordered time of trouble on the earth? and are not his days like the days of a servant working for payment? </span>
<span class='v JB7_2' data-id='JB7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As a servant desiring the shades of evening, and a workman looking for his payment: </span>
<span class='v JB7_3' data-id='JB7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I have for my heritage months of pain to no purpose, and nights of weariness are given to me. </span>
<span class='v JB7_4' data-id='JB7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When I go to my bed, I say, When will it be time to get up? but the night is long, and I am turning from side to side till morning light. </span>
<span class='v JB7_5' data-id='JB7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My flesh is covered with worms and dust; my skin gets hard and then is cracked again. </span>
<span class='v JB7_6' data-id='JB7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>My days go quicker than the cloth-worker's thread, and come to an end without hope. </span>
<span class='v JB7_7' data-id='JB7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>O, keep in mind that my life is wind: my eye will never again see good. </span>
<span class='v JB7_8' data-id='JB7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The eye of him who sees me will see me no longer: your eyes will be looking for me, but I will be gone. </span>
<span class='v JB7_9' data-id='JB7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>A cloud comes to an end and is gone; so he who goes down into the underworld comes not up again. </span>
<span class='v JB7_10' data-id='JB7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He will not come back to his house, and his place will have no more knowledge of him. </span>
<span class='v JB7_11' data-id='JB7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So I will not keep my mouth shut; I will let the words come from it in the pain of my spirit, my soul will make a bitter outcry. </span>
<span class='v JB7_12' data-id='JB7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Am I a sea, or a sea-beast, that you put a watch over me? </span>
<span class='v JB7_13' data-id='JB7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When I say, In my bed I will have comfort, there I will get rest from my disease; </span>
<span class='v JB7_14' data-id='JB7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then you send dreams to me, and visions of fear; </span>
<span class='v JB7_15' data-id='JB7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So that a hard death seems better to my soul than my pains. </span>
<span class='v JB7_16' data-id='JB7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I have no desire for life, I would not be living for ever! Keep away from me, for my days are as a breath. </span>
<span class='v JB7_17' data-id='JB7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>What is man, that you have made him great, and that your attention is fixed on him, </span>
<span class='v JB7_18' data-id='JB7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And that your hand is on him every morning, and that you are testing him every minute? </span>
<span class='v JB7_19' data-id='JB7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>How long will it be before your eyes are turned away from me, so that I may have a minute's breathing-space? </span>
<span class='v JB7_20' data-id='JB7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>If I have done wrong, what have I done to you, O keeper of men? why have you made me a mark for your blows, so that I am a weariness to myself? </span>
<span class='v JB7_21' data-id='JB7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And why do you not take away my sin, and let my wrongdoing be ended? for now I go down to the dust, and you will be searching for me with care, but I will be gone. </span></div></div>
