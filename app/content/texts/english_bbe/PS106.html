<span class='v PS106_6' data-id='PS106_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We are sinners like our fathers, we have done wrong, our acts are evil. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_7' data-id='PS106_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Our fathers did not give thought to your wonders in Egypt; they did not keep in memory the great number of your mercies, but gave you cause for wrath at the sea, even at the Red Sea. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_8' data-id='PS106_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But he was their saviour because of his name, so that men might see his great power. </span></div>

<span class='v PS106_19' data-id='PS106_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They made a young ox in Horeb, and gave worship to an image of gold. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_20' data-id='PS106_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And their glory was changed into the image of an ox, whose food is grass. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_21' data-id='PS106_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They had no memory of God their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_22' data-id='PS106_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Works of wonder in the land of Ham, and things of fear by the Red Sea. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_23' data-id='PS106_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he was purposing to put an end to them if Moses, his special servant, had not gone up before him, between him and his people, turning back his wrath, to keep them from destruction. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_24' data-id='PS106_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>They were disgusted with the good land; they had no belief in his word; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_25' data-id='PS106_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Talking against him secretly in their tents, they did not give ear to the voice of the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_26' data-id='PS106_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So he made an oath against them, to put an end to them in the waste land: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_27' data-id='PS106_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>That their children might be mixed among the nations, and sent away into other lands. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_28' data-id='PS106_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they were joined to Baal-peor, and took part in the offerings to the dead. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_29' data-id='PS106_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So they made him angry by their behaviour; and he sent disease on them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_30' data-id='PS106_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then Phinehas got up, and made prayer for them; and the disease went no farther. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_31' data-id='PS106_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And all the generations coming after him kept the memory of his righteousness for ever. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_32' data-id='PS106_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>They made God angry again at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses was troubled because of them; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_33' data-id='PS106_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>For they made his spirit bitter, and he said unwise things. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_34' data-id='PS106_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>They did not put an end to the peoples, as the Lord had said; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_35' data-id='PS106_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But they were joined to the nations, learning their works. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_36' data-id='PS106_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And they gave worship to images; which were a danger to them: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_37' data-id='PS106_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They even made offerings of their sons and their daughters to evil spirits, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_38' data-id='PS106_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And gave the blood of their sons and their daughters who had done no wrong, offering them to the images of Canaan; and the land was made unclean with blood. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_39' data-id='PS106_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So they became unclean through their works, going after their evil desires. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_40' data-id='PS106_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then the wrath of the Lord was burning against his people, and he was angry with his heritage. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_41' data-id='PS106_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And he gave them into the hands of the nations; and they were ruled by their haters. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_42' data-id='PS106_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>By them they were crushed, and made low under their hands. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_43' data-id='PS106_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Again and again he made them free; but their hearts were turned against his purpose, and they were overcome by their sins. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_44' data-id='PS106_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>But when their cry came to his ears, he had pity on their trouble: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_45' data-id='PS106_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And kept in mind his agreement with them, and in his great mercy gave them forgiveness. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_46' data-id='PS106_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>He put pity into the hearts of those who made them prisoners. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_47' data-id='PS106_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Be our saviour, O Lord our God, and let us come back together from among the nations, so that we may give honour to your holy name, and have glory in your praise. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS106_48' data-id='PS106_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the Lord God of Israel for ever and for ever; and let all the people say, So be it. Give praise to the Lord. </span></div></div>
