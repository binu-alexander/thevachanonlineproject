<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_2' data-id='PS49_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>High and low together, the poor, and those who have wealth. </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_4' data-id='PS49_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will put my teaching into a story; I will make my dark sayings clear with music. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_5' data-id='PS49_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>What cause have I for fear in the days of evil, when the evil-doing of those who are working for my downfall is round about me? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_6' data-id='PS49_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Even of those whose faith is in their wealth, and whose hearts are lifted up because of their stores. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_7' data-id='PS49_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Truly, no man may get back his soul for a price, or give to God the payment for himself; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_8' data-id='PS49_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>(Because it takes a great price to keep his soul from death, and man is not able to give it.) </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_10' data-id='PS49_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he sees that wise men come to their end, and foolish persons of low behaviour come to destruction together, letting their wealth go to others. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_11' data-id='PS49_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The place of the dead is their house for ever, and their resting-place through all generations; those who come after them give their names to their lands. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_12' data-id='PS49_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But man, like the animals, does not go on for ever; he comes to an end like the beasts. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_13' data-id='PS49_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is the way of the foolish; their silver is for those who come after them, and their children get the pleasure of their gold. (Selah.) </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_14' data-id='PS49_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Death will give them their food like sheep; the underworld is their fate and they will go down into it; their flesh is food for worms; their form is wasted away; the underworld is their resting-place for ever. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_15' data-id='PS49_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But God will get back my soul; for he will take me from the power of death. (Selah.) </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_17' data-id='PS49_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For at his death, he will take nothing away; his glory will not go down after him. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS49_18' data-id='PS49_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Though he might have pride in his soul in his life-time, and men will give you praise if you do well for yourself, </span></div>
