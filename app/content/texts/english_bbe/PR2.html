<span class='v PR2_1' data-id='PR2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My son, if you will take my words to your heart, storing up my laws in your mind; </span>
<span class='v PR2_2' data-id='PR2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So that your ear gives attention to wisdom, and your heart is turned to knowledge; </span>
<span class='v PR2_3' data-id='PR2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Truly, if you are crying out for good sense, and your request is for knowledge; </span>
<span class='v PR2_4' data-id='PR2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If you are looking for her as for silver, and searching for her as for stored-up wealth; </span>
<span class='v PR2_5' data-id='PR2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the fear of the Lord will be clear to you, and knowledge of God will be yours. </span>
<span class='v PR2_6' data-id='PR2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For the Lord gives wisdom; out of his mouth come knowledge and reason: </span>
<span class='v PR2_7' data-id='PR2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He has salvation stored up for the upright, he is a breastplate to those in whom there is no evil; </span>
<span class='v PR2_8' data-id='PR2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He keeps watch on the ways which are right, and takes care of those who have the fear of him. </span>
<span class='v PR2_9' data-id='PR2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then you will have knowledge of righteousness and right acting, and upright behaviour, even of every good way. </span>
<span class='v PR2_10' data-id='PR2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasing to your soul; </span>
<span class='v PR2_11' data-id='PR2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Wise purposes will be watching over you, and knowledge will keep you; </span>
<span class='v PR2_12' data-id='PR2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Giving you salvation from the evil man, from those whose words are false; </span>
<span class='v PR2_13' data-id='PR2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who give up the way of righteousness, to go by dark roads; </span>
<span class='v PR2_14' data-id='PR2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Who take pleasure in wrongdoing, and have joy in the evil designs of the sinner; </span>
<span class='v PR2_15' data-id='PR2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whose ways are not straight, and whose footsteps are turned to evil: </span>
<span class='v PR2_16' data-id='PR2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To take you out of the power of the strange woman, who says smooth words with her tongue; </span>
<span class='v PR2_17' data-id='PR2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Who is false to the husband of her early years, and does not keep the agreement of her God in mind: </span>
<span class='v PR2_18' data-id='PR2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For her house is on the way down to death; her footsteps go down to the shades: </span>
<span class='v PR2_19' data-id='PR2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Those who go to her do not come back again; their feet do not keep in the ways of life: </span>
<span class='v PR2_20' data-id='PR2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So that you may go in the way of good men, and keep in the footsteps of the upright. </span>
