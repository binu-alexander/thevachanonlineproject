<span class='v JB42_1' data-id='JB42_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job said in answer to the Lord, </span>
<span class='v JB42_2' data-id='JB42_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I see that you are able to do every thing, and to give effect to all your designs. </span>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Who is this who makes dark the purpose of God by words without knowledge? For I have been talking without knowledge about wonders not to be searched out. </span>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me, and I will say what is in my mind; I will put questions to you, and you will give me the answers. </span>
<span class='v JB42_5' data-id='JB42_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Word of you had come to my ears, but now my eye has seen you. </span>
<span class='v JB42_6' data-id='JB42_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause I give witness that what I said is false, and in sorrow I take my seat in the dust. </span>
<span class='v JB42_7' data-id='JB42_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And it came about, after he had said these words to Job, that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite, I am very angry with you and your two friends, because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has. </span>
<span class='v JB42_8' data-id='JB42_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And now, take seven oxen and seven sheep, and go to my servant Job, and give a burned offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will make prayer for you, that I may not send punishment on you; because you have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job has. </span>
<span class='v JB42_9' data-id='JB42_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, went and did as the Lord had said. And the Lord gave ear to Job. </span>
<span class='v JB42_10' data-id='JB42_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the Lord made up to Job for all his losses, after he had made prayer for his friends: and all Job had before was increased by the Lord twice as much. </span>
<span class='v JB42_11' data-id='JB42_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And all his brothers and sisters, and his friends of earlier days, came and took food with him in his house; and made clear their grief for him, and gave him comfort for all the evil which the Lord had sent on him; and they all gave him a bit of money and a gold ring. </span>
<span class='v JB42_12' data-id='JB42_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the Lord's blessing was greater on the end of Job's life than on its start: and so he came to have fourteen thousand sheep and goats, and six thousand camels, and two thousand oxen, and a thousand she-asses. </span>
<span class='v JB42_13' data-id='JB42_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he had seven sons and three daughters. </span>
<span class='v JB42_14' data-id='JB42_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he gave the first the name of Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch; </span>
<span class='v JB42_15' data-id='JB42_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And there were no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job in all the earth: and their father gave them a heritage among their brothers. </span>
<span class='v JB42_16' data-id='JB42_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And after this Job had a hundred and forty years of life, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. </span>
<span class='v JB42_17' data-id='JB42_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Job came to his end, old and full of days. </span></div></div>
