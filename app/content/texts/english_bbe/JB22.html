<span class='v JB22_1' data-id='JB22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Eliphaz the Temanite made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB22_2' data-id='JB22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Is it possible for a man to be of profit to God? No, for a man's wisdom is only of profit to himself. </span>
<span class='v JB22_3' data-id='JB22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Is it of any interest to the Ruler of all that you are upright? or is it of use to him that your ways are without sin? </span>
<span class='v JB22_4' data-id='JB22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Is it because you give him honour that he is sending punishment on you and is judging you? </span>
<span class='v JB22_5' data-id='JB22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Is not your evil-doing great? and there is no end to your sins. </span>
<span class='v JB22_6' data-id='JB22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For you have taken your brother's goods when he was not in your debt, and have taken away the clothing of those who have need of it. </span>
<span class='v JB22_7' data-id='JB22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You do not give water to the tired traveller, and from him who has no food you keep back bread. </span>
<span class='v JB22_8' data-id='JB22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For it was the man with power who had the land, and the man with an honoured name who was living in it. </span>
<span class='v JB22_9' data-id='JB22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You have sent widows away without hearing their cause, and you have taken away the support of the child who has no father. </span>
<span class='v JB22_10' data-id='JB22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this cause nets are round your feet, and you are overcome with sudden fear. </span>
<span class='v JB22_11' data-id='JB22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Your light is made dark so that you are unable to see, and you are covered by a mass of waters. </span>
<span class='v JB22_12' data-id='JB22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Is not God as high as heaven? and see the stars, how high they are! </span>
<span class='v JB22_13' data-id='JB22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And you say, What knowledge has God? is he able to give decisions through the deep dark? </span>
<span class='v JB22_14' data-id='JB22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Thick clouds are covering him, so that he is unable to see; and he is walking on the arch of heaven. </span>
<span class='v JB22_15' data-id='JB22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Will you keep the old way by which evil men went? </span>
<span class='v JB22_16' data-id='JB22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Who were violently taken away before their time, who were overcome by the rush of waters: </span>
<span class='v JB22_17' data-id='JB22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Who said to God, Go away from us; and, What is the Ruler of all able to do to us? </span>
<span class='v JB22_18' data-id='JB22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Though he made their houses full of good things: but the purpose of the evil-doers is far from me! </span>
<span class='v JB22_19' data-id='JB22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The upright saw it and were glad: and those who had done no wrong made sport of them, </span>
<span class='v JB22_20' data-id='JB22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Saying, Truly, their substance is cut off, and their wealth is food for the fire. </span>
<span class='v JB22_21' data-id='JB22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Put yourself now in a right relation with him and be at peace: so will you do well in your undertakings. </span>
<span class='v JB22_22' data-id='JB22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Be pleased to take teaching from his mouth, and let his words be stored up in your heart. </span>
<span class='v JB22_23' data-id='JB22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If you come back to the Ruler of all, making yourself low before him; if you put evil far away from your tents; </span>
<span class='v JB22_24' data-id='JB22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And put your gold in the dust, even your gold of Ophir among the rocks of the valleys; </span>
<span class='v JB22_25' data-id='JB22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then the Ruler of all will be your gold, and his teaching will be your silver; </span>
<span class='v JB22_26' data-id='JB22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For then you will have delight in the Ruler of all, and your face will be lifted up to God. </span>
<span class='v JB22_27' data-id='JB22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>You will make your prayer to him, and be answered; and you will give effect to your oaths. </span>
<span class='v JB22_28' data-id='JB22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Your purposes will come about, and light will be shining on your ways. </span>
<span class='v JB22_29' data-id='JB22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For God makes low those whose hearts are lifted up, but he is a saviour to the poor in spirit. </span>
<span class='v JB22_30' data-id='JB22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He makes safe the man who is free from sin, and if your hands are clean, salvation will be yours. </span></div></div>
