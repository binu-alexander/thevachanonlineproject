<span class='v NM2_1' data-id='NM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A crusher has come up before your face: keep a good look-out, let the way be watched, make yourself strong, let your power be greatly increased. </span>
<span class='v NM2_2' data-id='NM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For the Lord will make good the vine of Jacob, as well as the vine of Israel: for the wasters have made them waste and sent destruction on the branches of their vine. </span>
<span class='v NM2_3' data-id='NM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The body-covers of his fighting men have been made red, the men of war are clothed in bright red: the war-carriages are like flames of fire in the day when he gets ready, the horses are shaking. </span>
<span class='v NM2_4' data-id='NM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The war-carriages are rushing through the streets, pushing against one another in the wide ways, looking like burning lights, running like thunder-flames. </span>
<span class='v NM2_5' data-id='NM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He takes the record of his great men: they go falling on their way; they go quickly to the wall, the cover is made ready. </span>
<span class='v NM2_6' data-id='NM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The river doorways are forced open, and the king's house is flowing away. </span>
<span class='v NM2_7' data-id='NM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the queen is uncovered, she is taken away and her servant-girls are weeping like the sound of doves, hammering on their breasts. </span>
<span class='v NM2_8' data-id='NM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Nineveh is like a pool of water whose waters are flowing away; Keep your place, they say; but no one is turning back. </span>
<span class='v NM2_9' data-id='NM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Take silver, take gold; for there is no end to the store; take for yourselves a weight of things to be desired. </span>
<span class='v NM2_10' data-id='NM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Everything has been taken from her, all is gone, she has nothing more: the heart is turned to water, the knees are shaking, all are twisted in pain, and colour has gone from all faces. </span>
<span class='v NM2_11' data-id='NM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Where is the lions' hole, the place where the young lions got their food, where the lion and the she-lion were walking with their young, without cause for fear? </span>
<span class='v NM2_12' data-id='NM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Food enough for his young and for his she-lions was pulled down by the lion; his hole was full of flesh and his resting-place stored with meat. </span>
<span class='v NM2_13' data-id='NM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>See, I am against you, says the Lord of armies, and I will have your war-carriages burned in the smoke, and your young lions will be food for the sword: you will no longer get your food by force on the earth, and the voice of your she-lions will be stopped for ever. </span></div></div>
