<span class='v IS46_1' data-id='IS46_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Bel is bent down, Nebo is falling; their images are on the beasts and on the cattle: the things which you took about have become a weight to the tired beast. </span>
<span class='v IS46_2' data-id='IS46_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They are bent down, they are falling together: they were not able to keep their images safe, but they themselves have been taken prisoner. </span>
<span class='v IS46_3' data-id='IS46_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me, O family of Jacob, and all the rest of the people of Israel, who have been supported by me from their birth, and have been my care from their earliest days: </span>
<span class='v IS46_4' data-id='IS46_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Even when you are old I will be the same, and when you are grey-haired I will take care of you: I will still be responsible for what I made; yes, I will take you and keep you safe. </span>
<span class='v IS46_5' data-id='IS46_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Who in your eyes is my equal? or what comparison will you make with me? </span>
<span class='v IS46_6' data-id='IS46_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>As for those who take gold out of a bag, and put silver in the scales, they give payment to a gold-worker, to make it into a god; they go down on their faces and give it worship. </span>
<span class='v IS46_7' data-id='IS46_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They put him on their backs, and take him up, and put him in his fixed place, from which he may not be moved; if a man gives a cry for help to him, he is unable to give an answer, or get him out of his trouble. </span>
<span class='v IS46_8' data-id='IS46_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Keep this in mind and be shamed; let it come back to your memory, you sinners. </span>
<span class='v IS46_9' data-id='IS46_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let the things which are past come to your memory: for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no one like me; </span>
<span class='v IS46_10' data-id='IS46_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Making clear from the first what is to come, and from past times the things which have not so far come about; saying, My purpose is fixed, and I will do all my pleasure; </span>
<span class='v IS46_11' data-id='IS46_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Sending for a bird of strong flight from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country; I have said it, and I will give effect to it; the thing designed by me will certainly be done. </span>
<span class='v IS46_12' data-id='IS46_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me, you feeble-hearted, who have no faith in my righteousness: </span>
<span class='v IS46_13' data-id='IS46_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>My righteousness is near, it is not far off; salvation will come quickly; and I will make Zion free, and give Israel my glory. </span></div></div>
