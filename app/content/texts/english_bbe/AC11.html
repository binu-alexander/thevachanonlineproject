<span class='v AC11_1' data-id='AC11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the Apostles and the brothers who were in Judaea had news that the word of God had been given to the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v AC11_2' data-id='AC11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And when Peter came to Jerusalem, those who kept the rule of circumcision had an argument with him, </span>
<span class='v AC11_3' data-id='AC11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Saying, You went to men without circumcision, and took food with them. </span>
<span class='v AC11_4' data-id='AC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Peter gave them an account of it all in order, saying to them, </span>
<span class='v AC11_5' data-id='AC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I was in the town of Joppa, at prayer: and falling into a deep sleep, I saw in a vision a vessel like a great cloth let down from heaven, and it came down to me: </span>
<span class='v AC11_6' data-id='AC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And looking on it with attention I saw in it all sorts of beasts and birds. </span>
<span class='v AC11_7' data-id='AC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And a voice came to my ears saying, Come, Peter; take them for food. </span>
<span class='v AC11_8' data-id='AC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But I said, No, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever come into my mouth. </span>
<span class='v AC11_9' data-id='AC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the voice, coming a second time from heaven, said, What God has made clean, do not you make common. </span>
<span class='v AC11_10' data-id='AC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And this was done three times, and they were all taken up again into heaven. </span>
<span class='v AC11_11' data-id='AC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And at that minute, three men, sent from Caesarea, came to the house where we were. </span>
<span class='v AC11_12' data-id='AC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit gave me orders to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers came with me; and we went into that man's house: </span>
<span class='v AC11_13' data-id='AC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he gave us an account of how he had seen the angel in his house, saying, Send to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you; </span>
<span class='v AC11_14' data-id='AC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Who will say words to you through which you and all your family may get salvation. </span>
<span class='v AC11_15' data-id='AC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And, while I was talking to them, the Holy Spirit came on them, as on us at first. </span>
<span class='v AC11_16' data-id='AC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the words of the Lord came into my mind, how he said, The baptism of John was with water, but you will have baptism with the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC11_17' data-id='AC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If then God gave them, when they had faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the same as he gave to us, who was I to go against God? </span>
<span class='v AC11_18' data-id='AC11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And hearing these things they said nothing more, but gave glory to God, saying, Then to the Gentiles as to us has God given a change of heart, so that they may have life. </span>
<span class='v AC11_19' data-id='AC11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then those who had gone away at the time of the trouble about Stephen, went as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus, preaching to the Jews only. </span>
<span class='v AC11_20' data-id='AC11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, when they came to Antioch, gave the good news about the Lord Jesus to the Greeks. </span>
<span class='v AC11_21' data-id='AC11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the power of the Lord was with them, and a great number had faith and were turned to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC11_22' data-id='AC11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And news of them came to the ears of the church at Jerusalem: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch: </span>
<span class='v AC11_23' data-id='AC11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Who, when he came and saw the grace of God, was glad; and he made clear to them the need of keeping near the Lord with all the strength of their hearts: </span>
<span class='v AC11_24' data-id='AC11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and a great number were joined to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC11_25' data-id='AC11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then he went on to Tarsus, looking for Saul; </span>
<span class='v AC11_26' data-id='AC11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And when he had come across him, he took him to Antioch. And they were with the church there for a year, teaching the people; and the disciples were first given the name of Christians in Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_27' data-id='AC11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Now in those days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_28' data-id='AC11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And one of them, named Agabus, said publicly through the Spirit that there would be serious need of food all over the earth: which came about in the time of Claudius. </span>
<span class='v AC11_29' data-id='AC11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the disciples, everyone as he was able, made a decision to send help to the brothers living in Judaea: </span>
<span class='v AC11_30' data-id='AC11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Which they did, sending it to the rulers of the church by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. </span></div></div>
