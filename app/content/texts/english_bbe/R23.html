<span class='v R23_2' data-id='R23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The building was started in the second month in the fourth year of his rule. </span>
<span class='v R23_3' data-id='R23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Solomon put the base of the house of God in position; by the older measure it was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide. </span>
<span class='v R23_4' data-id='R23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the covered way in front of the house was twenty cubits long, as wide as the house, and a hundred and twenty cubits high, all plated inside with the best gold. </span>
<span class='v R23_5' data-id='R23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the greater house was roofed with cypress-wood, plated with the best gold and ornamented with designs of palm-trees and chains. </span>
<span class='v R23_6' data-id='R23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the house was made beautiful with stones of great value, and the gold was gold of Parvaim. </span>
<span class='v R23_7' data-id='R23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>All the house was plated with gold, the supports, the steps, the walls and the doors; and the walls were ornamented with designs of winged ones. </span>
<span class='v R23_8' data-id='R23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he made the most holy place; it was twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, like the greater house, and was plated all over with the best gold; six hundred talents were used for it. </span>
<span class='v R23_9' data-id='R23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And fifty shekels weight of gold was used for the nails. He had all the higher rooms plated with gold. </span>
<span class='v R23_10' data-id='R23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And in the most holy place he made images of two winged beings, covering them with gold. </span>
<span class='v R23_11' data-id='R23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across; one wing, five cubits long, touching the wall of the house, and the other, of the same size, meeting the wing of the other winged one. </span>
<span class='v R23_12' data-id='R23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And in the same way, the wings of the other, five cubits long, were stretched out, one touching the wall and the other meeting the wing of the first winged one. </span>
<span class='v R23_13' data-id='R23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Their outstretched wings were twenty cubits across; they were placed upright on their feet, facing the inner part of the house. </span>
<span class='v R23_14' data-id='R23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he made the veil of blue and purple and red, of the best linen, worked with winged ones. </span>
<span class='v R23_15' data-id='R23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And in front of the house he made two pillars, thirty-five cubits high, with crowns on the tops of them, five cubits high. </span>
<span class='v R23_16' data-id='R23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he made chains, like neck ornaments, and put them on the tops of the pillars, and a hundred apples on the chains. </span>
<span class='v R23_17' data-id='R23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He put up the pillars in front of the Temple, one on the right side and one on the left, naming the one on the right Jachin and that on the left Boaz. </span></div></div>
