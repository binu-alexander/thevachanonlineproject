<span class='v LK1_1' data-id='LK1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As a number of attempts have been made to put together in order an account of those events which took place among us, </span>
<span class='v LK1_2' data-id='LK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As they were handed down to us by those who saw them from the first and were preachers of the word, </span>
<span class='v LK1_3' data-id='LK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It seemed good to me, having made observation, with great care, of the direction of events in their order, to put the facts in writing for you, most noble Theophilus; </span>
<span class='v LK1_4' data-id='LK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So that you might have certain knowledge of those things about which you were given teaching. </span>
<span class='v LK1_5' data-id='LK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the days of Herod, king of Judaea, there was a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the order of Abijah; and he had a wife of the family of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_6' data-id='LK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They were upright in the eyes of God, keeping all the rules and orders of God, and doing no wrong. </span>
<span class='v LK1_7' data-id='LK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they were without children, because Elisabeth had never given birth, and they were at that time very old. </span>
<span class='v LK1_8' data-id='LK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now it came about that in his turn he was acting as priest before God, </span>
<span class='v LK1_9' data-id='LK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And as was the way of the priests, he had to go into the Temple to see to the burning of perfumes. </span>
<span class='v LK1_10' data-id='LK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And all the people were offering prayers outside, at the time of the burning of perfumes. </span>
<span class='v LK1_11' data-id='LK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he saw an angel of the Lord in his place on the right side of the altar. </span>
<span class='v LK1_12' data-id='LK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear came on him. </span>
<span class='v LK1_13' data-id='LK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said, Have no fear, Zacharias, for your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your wife Elisabeth will have a son, and his name will be John. </span>
<span class='v LK1_14' data-id='LK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And you will be glad and have great delight; and numbers of people will have joy at his birth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_15' data-id='LK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For he will be great in the eyes of the Lord; he will not take wine or strong drink; and he will be full of the Spirit of God from his birth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_16' data-id='LK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And through him great numbers of the children of Israel will be turned to the Lord their God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_17' data-id='LK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he will go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah, turning the hearts of fathers to their children, and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness; to make ready a people whose hearts have been turned to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK1_18' data-id='LK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Zacharias said to the angel, How may I be certain of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far on in years. </span>
<span class='v LK1_19' data-id='LK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the angel, answering, said, I am Gabriel, whose place is before God; I have been sent to say these words to you and to give you this good news. </span>
<span class='v LK1_20' data-id='LK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now, see, you will be without voice or language till the day when these things come about, because you had not faith in my words, which will have effect at the right time. </span>
<span class='v LK1_21' data-id='LK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the people were waiting for Zacharias and were surprised because he was in the Temple for such a long time. </span>
<span class='v LK1_22' data-id='LK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And when he came out he was not able to say anything, and they saw that he had seen a vision in the Temple; and he was making signs to them without words. </span>
<span class='v LK1_23' data-id='LK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when the days of his work in the Temple were ended, he went back to his house. </span>
<span class='v LK1_24' data-id='LK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After that time, Elisabeth, being certain that she was to become a mother, kept herself from men's eyes for five months, saying, </span>
<span class='v LK1_25' data-id='LK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The Lord has done this to me, for his eyes were on me, to take away my shame in the eyes of men. </span>
<span class='v LK1_26' data-id='LK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee, named Nazareth, </span>
<span class='v LK1_27' data-id='LK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>To a virgin who was to be married to a man named Joseph, of the family of David; and the name of the virgin was Mary. </span>
<span class='v LK1_28' data-id='LK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And the angel came in to her and said, Peace be with you, to whom special grace has been given; the Lord is with you. </span>
<span class='v LK1_29' data-id='LK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But she was greatly troubled at his words, and said to herself, What may be the purpose of these words? </span>
<span class='v LK1_30' data-id='LK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to her, Have no fear, Mary, for you have God's approval. </span>
<span class='v LK1_31' data-id='LK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And see, you will give birth to a son, and his name will be Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK1_32' data-id='LK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He will be great, and will be named the Son of the Most High: and the Lord God will give him the kingdom of David, his father: </span>
<span class='v LK1_33' data-id='LK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He will have rule over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end. </span>
<span class='v LK1_34' data-id='LK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Mary said to the angel, How may this be, because I have had no knowledge of a man? </span>
<span class='v LK1_35' data-id='LK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And the angel in answer said to her, The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will come to rest on you, and so that which will come to birth will be named holy, Son of God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_36' data-id='LK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Even now Elisabeth, who is of your family, is to be a mother, though she is old: and this is the sixth month with her who was without children. </span>
<span class='v LK1_37' data-id='LK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>For there is nothing which God is not able to do. </span>
<span class='v LK1_38' data-id='LK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And Mary said: I am the servant of the Lord; may it be to me as you say. And the angel went away. </span>
<span class='v LK1_39' data-id='LK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then Mary got up and went quickly into the high lands, to a town of Judah; </span>
<span class='v LK1_40' data-id='LK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And went into the house of Zacharias and took Elisabeth in her arms. </span>
<span class='v LK1_41' data-id='LK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And when the voice of Mary came to the ears of Elisabeth, the baby made a sudden move inside her; then Elisabeth was full of the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v LK1_42' data-id='LK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And she said with a loud voice: May blessing be on you among women, and a blessing on the child of your body. </span>
<span class='v LK1_43' data-id='LK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>How is it that the mother of my Lord comes to me? </span>
<span class='v LK1_44' data-id='LK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>For, truly, when the sound of your voice came to my ears, the baby in my body made a sudden move for joy. </span>
<span class='v LK1_45' data-id='LK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Happy will she be who had faith that the things which the Lord has said to her will be done. </span>
<span class='v LK1_46' data-id='LK1_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And Mary said: My soul gives glory to God; </span>
<span class='v LK1_47' data-id='LK1_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>My spirit is glad in God my Saviour. </span>
<span class='v LK1_48' data-id='LK1_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>For he has had pity on his servant, though she is poor and lowly placed: and from this hour will all generations give witness to the blessing which has come to me. </span>
<span class='v LK1_49' data-id='LK1_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>For he who is strong has done great things for me; and holy is his name. </span>
<span class='v LK1_50' data-id='LK1_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>His mercy is for all generations in whom is the fear of him. </span>
<span class='v LK1_51' data-id='LK1_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>With his arm he has done acts of power; he has put to flight those who have pride in their hearts. </span>
<span class='v LK1_52' data-id='LK1_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>He has put down kings from their seats, lifting up on high the men of low degree. </span>
<span class='v LK1_53' data-id='LK1_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Those who had no food he made full of good things; the men of wealth he sent away with nothing in their hands; </span>
<span class='v LK1_54' data-id='LK1_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>His help he has given to Israel, his servant, so that he might keep in mind his mercy to Abraham and his seed for ever, </span>
<span class='v LK1_55' data-id='LK1_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>As he gave his word to our fathers. </span>
<span class='v LK1_56' data-id='LK1_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And Mary was with her for about three months and then went back to her house. </span>
<span class='v LK1_57' data-id='LK1_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth, and she had a son. </span>
<span class='v LK1_58' data-id='LK1_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>And it came to the ears of her neighbours and relations that the Lord had been very good to her, and they took part in her joy. </span>
<span class='v LK1_59' data-id='LK1_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day they came to see to the circumcision of the child, and they would have given him the name of Zacharias, his father's name; </span>
<span class='v LK1_60' data-id='LK1_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>But his mother made answer and said, No, his name is John. </span>
<span class='v LK1_61' data-id='LK1_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>And they said, Not one of your relations has that name. </span>
<span class='v LK1_62' data-id='LK1_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>And they made signs to his father, to say what name was to be given to him. </span>
<span class='v LK1_63' data-id='LK1_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>And he sent for writing materials and put down: His name is John; and they were all surprised. </span>
<span class='v LK1_64' data-id='LK1_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>And straight away his mouth was open and his tongue was free and he gave praise to God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_65' data-id='LK1_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And fear came on all those who were living round about them: and there was much talk about all these things in all the hill-country of Judaea. </span>
<span class='v LK1_66' data-id='LK1_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>And all who had word of them kept them in their minds and said, What will this child be? For the hand of the Lord was with him. </span>
<span class='v LK1_67' data-id='LK1_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>And his father, Zacharias, was full of the Holy Spirit, and with the voice of a prophet said these words: </span>
<span class='v LK1_68' data-id='LK1_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has come to his people and made them free, </span>
<span class='v LK1_69' data-id='LK1_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span>Lifting up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, </span>
<span class='v LK1_70' data-id='LK1_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>(As he said, by the mouth of his holy prophets, from the earliest times,) </span>
<span class='v LK1_71' data-id='LK1_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&nbsp;</span>Salvation from those who are against us, and from the hands of those who have hate for us; </span>
<span class='v LK1_72' data-id='LK1_72'><span class='v-num v-72'>72&nbsp;</span>To do acts of mercy to our fathers and to keep in mind his holy word, </span>
<span class='v LK1_73' data-id='LK1_73'><span class='v-num v-73'>73&nbsp;</span>The oath which he made to Abraham, our father, </span>
<span class='v LK1_74' data-id='LK1_74'><span class='v-num v-74'>74&nbsp;</span>That we, being made free from the fear of those who are against us, might give him worship, </span>
<span class='v LK1_75' data-id='LK1_75'><span class='v-num v-75'>75&nbsp;</span>In righteousness and holy living before him all our days. </span>
<span class='v LK1_76' data-id='LK1_76'><span class='v-num v-76'>76&nbsp;</span>And you, child, will be named the prophet of the Most High: you will go before the face of the Lord, to make ready his ways; </span>
<span class='v LK1_77' data-id='LK1_77'><span class='v-num v-77'>77&nbsp;</span>To give knowledge of salvation to his people, through the forgiveness of sins, </span>
<span class='v LK1_78' data-id='LK1_78'><span class='v-num v-78'>78&nbsp;</span>Because of the loving mercies of our God, by which the dawn from heaven has come to us, </span>
<span class='v LK1_79' data-id='LK1_79'><span class='v-num v-79'>79&nbsp;</span>To give light to those in dark places, and in the shade of death, so that our feet may be guided into the way of peace. </span>
<span class='v LK1_80' data-id='LK1_80'><span class='v-num v-80'>80&nbsp;</span>And the child became tall, and strong in spirit; and he was living in the waste land till the day when he came before the eyes of Israel. </span></div></div>
