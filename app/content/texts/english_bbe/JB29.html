<span class='v JB29_1' data-id='JB29_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job again took up the word and said, </span>
<span class='v JB29_2' data-id='JB29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If only I might again be as I was in the months which are past, in the days when God was watching over me! </span>
<span class='v JB29_3' data-id='JB29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When his light was shining over my head, and when I went through the dark by his light. </span>
<span class='v JB29_4' data-id='JB29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As I was in my flowering years, when my tent was covered by the hand of God; </span>
<span class='v JB29_5' data-id='JB29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>While the Ruler of all was still with me, and my children were round me; </span>
<span class='v JB29_6' data-id='JB29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When my steps were washed with milk, and rivers of oil were flowing out of the rock for me. </span>
<span class='v JB29_7' data-id='JB29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When I went out of my door to go up to the town, and took my seat in the public place, </span>
<span class='v JB29_8' data-id='JB29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The young men saw me, and went away, and the old men got up from their seats; </span>
<span class='v JB29_9' data-id='JB29_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The rulers kept quiet, and put their hands on their mouths; </span>
<span class='v JB29_10' data-id='JB29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The chiefs kept back their words, and their tongues were joined to the roofs of their mouths. </span>
<span class='v JB29_11' data-id='JB29_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For when it came to their ears, men said that I was truly happy; and when their eyes saw, they gave witness to me; </span>
<span class='v JB29_12' data-id='JB29_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I was a saviour to the poor when he was crying for help, to the child with no father, and to him who had no supporter. </span>
<span class='v JB29_13' data-id='JB29_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The blessing of him who was near to destruction came on me, and I put a song of joy into the widow's heart. </span>
<span class='v JB29_14' data-id='JB29_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I put on righteousness as my clothing, and was full of it; right decisions were to me a robe and a head-dress. </span>
<span class='v JB29_15' data-id='JB29_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I was eyes to the blind, and feet to him who had no power of walking. </span>
<span class='v JB29_16' data-id='JB29_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I was a father to the poor, searching out the cause of him who was strange to me. </span>
<span class='v JB29_17' data-id='JB29_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>By me the great teeth of the evil-doer were broken, and I made him give up what he had violently taken away. </span>
<span class='v JB29_18' data-id='JB29_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then I said, I will come to my end with my children round me, my days will be as the sand in number; </span>
<span class='v JB29_19' data-id='JB29_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My root will be open to the waters, and the night mist will be on my branches, </span>

<span class='v JB29_24' data-id='JB29_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>I was laughing at them when they had no hope, and the light of my face was never clouded by their fear. </span>
<span class='v JB29_25' data-id='JB29_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I took my place as a chief, guiding them on their way, and I was as a king among his army. ... </span></div></div>
