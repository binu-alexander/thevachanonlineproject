<span class='v JB28_2' data-id='JB28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone is changed into brass by the fire. </span>
<span class='v JB28_3' data-id='JB28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Man puts an end to the dark, searching out to the farthest limit the stones of the deep places of the dark. </span>
<span class='v JB28_4' data-id='JB28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He makes a deep mine far away from those living in the light of day; when they go about on the earth, they have no knowledge of those who are under them, who are hanging far from men, twisting from side to side on a cord. </span>
<span class='v JB28_5' data-id='JB28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As for the earth, bread comes out of it; but under its face it is turned up as if by fire. </span>
<span class='v JB28_6' data-id='JB28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. </span>

<span class='v JB28_8' data-id='JB28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The great beasts have not gone over it, and the cruel lion has not taken that way. </span>
<span class='v JB28_9' data-id='JB28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Man puts out his hand on the hard rock, overturning mountains by the roots. </span>
<span class='v JB28_10' data-id='JB28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He makes deep ways, cut through the rock, and his eye sees everything of value. </span>

<span class='v JB28_12' data-id='JB28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But where may wisdom be seen? and where is the resting-place of knowledge? </span>

<span class='v JB28_20' data-id='JB28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>From where then does wisdom come, and where is the resting-place of knowledge? </span>
<span class='v JB28_21' data-id='JB28_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For it is kept secret from the eyes of all living, unseen by the birds of the air. </span>
<span class='v JB28_22' data-id='JB28_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Destruction and Death say, We have only had word of it with our ears. </span>

<span class='v JB28_24' data-id='JB28_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For his eyes go to the ends of the earth, and he sees everything under heaven. </span>
<span class='v JB28_25' data-id='JB28_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When he made a weight for the wind, measuring out the waters; </span>
<span class='v JB28_26' data-id='JB28_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>When he made a law for the rain, and a way for the thunder-flames; </span>
<span class='v JB28_27' data-id='JB28_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he saw it, and put it on record; he gave it its fixed form, searching it out completely. </span>
<span class='v JB28_28' data-id='JB28_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he said to man, Truly the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to keep from evil is the way to knowledge. </span></div></div>
