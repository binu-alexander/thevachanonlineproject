<span class='v JG1_1' data-id='JG1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel made request to the Lord, saying, Who is to go up first to make war for us against the Canaanites? </span>
<span class='v JG1_2' data-id='JG1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, Judah is to go up: see, I have given the land into his hands. </span>
<span class='v JG1_3' data-id='JG1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my heritage, so that we may make war against the Canaanites; and I will then go with you into your heritage. So Simeon went with him. </span>
<span class='v JG1_4' data-id='JG1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Judah went up; and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hands; and they overcame ten thousand of them in Bezek. </span>
<span class='v JG1_5' data-id='JG1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they came across Adoni-zedek, and made war on him; and they overcame the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </span>
<span class='v JG1_6' data-id='JG1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Adoni-zedek went in flight; and they went after him and overtook him, and had his thumbs and his great toes cut off. </span>
<span class='v JG1_7' data-id='JG1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Adoni-zedek said, Seventy kings, whose thumbs and great toes had been cut off, got broken meat under my table: as I have done, so has God done to me in full. And they took him to Jerusalem, and he came to his end there. </span>
<span class='v JG1_8' data-id='JG1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the children of Judah made an attack on Jerusalem, and took it, burning down the town after they had put its people to the sword without mercy. </span>
<span class='v JG1_9' data-id='JG1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After that the children of Judah went down to make war on the Canaanites living in the hill-country and in the south and in the lowlands. </span>
<span class='v JG1_10' data-id='JG1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Caleb went against the Canaanites of Hebron: (now in earlier times Hebron was named Kiriath-arba:) and he put Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai to the sword. </span>
<span class='v JG1_11' data-id='JG1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And from there he went up against the people of Debir. (Now the name of Debir in earlier times was Kiriath-sepher.) </span>
<span class='v JG1_12' data-id='JG1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Caleb said, I will give Achsah, my daughter, as wife to the man who overcomes Kiriath-sepher and takes it. </span>
<span class='v JG1_13' data-id='JG1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah for his wife. </span>
<span class='v JG1_14' data-id='JG1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now when she came to him, he put into her mind the idea of requesting a field from her father: and she got down from her ass; and Caleb said to her, What is it? </span>
<span class='v JG1_15' data-id='JG1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, Give me a blessing; because you have put me in a dry south-land, now give me springs of water. So Caleb gave her the higher spring and the lower spring. </span>
<span class='v JG1_16' data-id='JG1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now Hobab the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, had come up out of the town of palm-trees, with the children of Judah, into the waste land of Arad; and he went and was living among the Amalekites; </span>
<span class='v JG1_17' data-id='JG1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Judah went with Simeon, his brother, and overcame the Canaanites living in Zephath, and put it under the curse; and he gave the town the name of Hormah. </span>
<span class='v JG1_18' data-id='JG1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Judah took Gaza and its limit, and Ashkelon and its limit, and Ekron and its limit. </span>
<span class='v JG1_19' data-id='JG1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the Lord was with Judah; and he took the hill-country for his heritage; but he was unable to make the people of the valley go out, for they had war-carriages of iron. </span>
<span class='v JG1_20' data-id='JG1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he took the land of the three sons of Anak, driving them out from there. </span>
<span class='v JG1_21' data-id='JG1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the children of Judah did not make the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem go out; the Jebusites are still living with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JG1_22' data-id='JG1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the family of Joseph went up against Beth-el, and the Lord was with them. </span>
<span class='v JG1_23' data-id='JG1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So they sent men to make a search round Beth-el. (Now the name of the town in earlier times was Luz.) </span>
<span class='v JG1_24' data-id='JG1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the watchers saw a man coming out of the town, and said to him, If you will make clear to us the way into the town, we will be kind to you. </span>
<span class='v JG1_25' data-id='JG1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So he made clear to them the way into the town, and they put it to the sword; but they let the man and all his family get away safe. </span>
<span class='v JG1_26' data-id='JG1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he went into the land of the Hittites, building a town there and naming it Luz: which is its name to this day. </span>
<span class='v JG1_27' data-id='JG1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Manasseh did not take away the land of the people of Beth-shean and its daughter-towns, or of Taanach and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Dor and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Ibleam and its daughter-towns, or of the people of Megiddo and its daughter-towns, driving them out; but the Canaanites would go on living in that land. </span>
<span class='v JG1_28' data-id='JG1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And whenever Israel became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced work, without driving them out completely. </span>
<span class='v JG1_29' data-id='JG1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Ephraim did not make the Canaanites who were living in Gezer go out; but the Canaanites went on living in Gezer among them. </span>
<span class='v JG1_30' data-id='JG1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Zebulun did not make the people of Kitron or the people of Nahalol go out; but the Canaanites went on living among them and were put to forced work. </span>
<span class='v JG1_31' data-id='JG1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And Asher did not take the land of the people of Acco, or Zidon, or Ahlab, or Achzib, or Helbah, or Aphik, or Rehob, driving them out; </span>
<span class='v JG1_32' data-id='JG1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But the Asherites went on living among the Canaanites, the people of the land, without driving them out. </span>
<span class='v JG1_33' data-id='JG1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Naphtali did not take the land of the people of Beth-shemesh or of Beth-anath, driving them out; but he was living among the Canaanites in the land; however, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were put to forced work. </span>
<span class='v JG1_34' data-id='JG1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And the children of Dan were forced into the hill-country by the Amorites, who would not let them come down into the valley; </span>
<span class='v JG1_35' data-id='JG1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>For the Amorites would go on living in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but the children of Joseph became stronger than they, and put them to forced work. </span>
<span class='v JG1_36' data-id='JG1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And the limit of the Edomites went from the slope of Akrabbim from Sela and up. </span></div></div>
