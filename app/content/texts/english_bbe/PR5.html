<span class='v PR5_1' data-id='PR5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My son, give attention to my wisdom; let your ear be turned to my teaching: </span>
<span class='v PR5_2' data-id='PR5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So that you may be ruled by a wise purpose, and your lips may keep knowledge. </span>
<span class='v PR5_3' data-id='PR5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For honey is dropping from the lips of the strange woman, and her mouth is smoother than oil; </span>
<span class='v PR5_4' data-id='PR5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword; </span>
<span class='v PR5_5' data-id='PR5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Her feet go down to death, and her steps to the underworld; </span>
<span class='v PR5_6' data-id='PR5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>She never keeps her mind on the road of life; her ways are uncertain, she has no knowledge. </span>
<span class='v PR5_7' data-id='PR5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me then, my sons, and do not put away my words from you. </span>
<span class='v PR5_8' data-id='PR5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Go far away from her, do not come near the door of her house; </span>
<span class='v PR5_9' data-id='PR5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For fear that you may give your honour to others, and your wealth to strange men: </span>
<span class='v PR5_10' data-id='PR5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And strange men may be full of your wealth, and the fruit of your work go to the house of others; </span>
<span class='v PR5_11' data-id='PR5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And you will be full of grief at the end of your life, when your flesh and your body are wasted; </span>
<span class='v PR5_12' data-id='PR5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And you will say, How was teaching hated by me, and my heart put no value on training; </span>
<span class='v PR5_13' data-id='PR5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I did not give attention to the voice of my teachers, my ear was not turned to those who were guiding me! </span>
<span class='v PR5_14' data-id='PR5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I was in almost all evil in the company of the people. </span>
<span class='v PR5_15' data-id='PR5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let water from your store and not that of others be your drink, and running water from your fountain. </span>
<span class='v PR5_16' data-id='PR5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let not your springs be flowing in the streets, or your streams of water in the open places. </span>
<span class='v PR5_17' data-id='PR5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let them be for yourself only, not for other men with you. </span>
<span class='v PR5_18' data-id='PR5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Let blessing be on your fountain; have joy in the wife of your early years. </span>
<span class='v PR5_19' data-id='PR5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>As a loving hind and a gentle doe, let her breasts ever give you rapture; let your passion at all times be moved by her love. </span>
<span class='v PR5_20' data-id='PR5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Why let yourself, my son, go out of the way with a strange woman, and take another woman in your arms? </span>
<span class='v PR5_21' data-id='PR5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For a man's ways are before the eyes of the Lord, and he puts all his goings in the scales. </span>
<span class='v PR5_22' data-id='PR5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The evil-doer will be taken in the net of his crimes, and prisoned in the cords of his sin. </span>
<span class='v PR5_23' data-id='PR5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He will come to his end for need of teaching; he is so foolish that he will go wandering from the right way. </span></div></div>
