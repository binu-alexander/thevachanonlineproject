<span class='v PR6_1' data-id='PR6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My son, if you have made yourself responsible for your neighbour, or given your word for another, </span>
<span class='v PR6_2' data-id='PR6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You are taken as in a net by the words of your mouth, the sayings of your lips have overcome you. </span>
<span class='v PR6_3' data-id='PR6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do this, my son, and make yourself free, because you have come into the power of your neighbour; go without waiting, and make a strong request to your neighbour. </span>
<span class='v PR6_4' data-id='PR6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Give no sleep to your eyes, or rest to them; </span>
<span class='v PR6_5' data-id='PR6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Make yourself free, like the roe from the hand of the archer, and the bird from him who puts a net for her. </span>
<span class='v PR6_6' data-id='PR6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Go to the ant, you hater of work; give thought to her ways and be wise: </span>
<span class='v PR6_7' data-id='PR6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Having no chief, overseer, or ruler, </span>
<span class='v PR6_8' data-id='PR6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>She gets her meat in the summer, storing up food at the time of the grain-cutting. </span>
<span class='v PR6_9' data-id='PR6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>How long will you be sleeping, O hater of work? when will you get up from your sleep? </span>
<span class='v PR6_10' data-id='PR6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>A little sleep, a little rest, a little folding of the hands in sleep: </span>
<span class='v PR6_11' data-id='PR6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then loss will come on you like an outlaw, and your need like an armed man </span>
<span class='v PR6_12' data-id='PR6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>A good-for-nothing man is an evil-doer; he goes on his way causing trouble with false words; </span>
<span class='v PR6_13' data-id='PR6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Making signs with his eyes, rubbing with his feet, and giving news with his fingers; </span>
<span class='v PR6_14' data-id='PR6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>His mind is ever designing evil: he lets loose violent acts. </span>
<span class='v PR6_15' data-id='PR6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this cause his downfall will be sudden; quickly he will be broken, and there will be no help for him. </span>
<span class='v PR6_16' data-id='PR6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Six things are hated by the Lord; seven things are disgusting to him: </span>
<span class='v PR6_17' data-id='PR6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Eyes of pride, a false tongue, hands which take life without cause; </span>
<span class='v PR6_18' data-id='PR6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>A heart full of evil designs, feet which are quick in running after sin; </span>
<span class='v PR6_19' data-id='PR6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>A false witness, breathing out untrue words, and one who lets loose violent acts among brothers. </span>
<span class='v PR6_20' data-id='PR6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>My son, keep the rule of your father, and have in memory the teaching of your mother: </span>
<span class='v PR6_21' data-id='PR6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Keep them ever folded in your heart, and have them hanging round your neck. </span>
<span class='v PR6_22' data-id='PR6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In your walking, it will be your guide; when you are sleeping, it will keep watch over you; when you are awake, it will have talk with you. </span>
<span class='v PR6_23' data-id='PR6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For the rule is a light, and the teaching a shining light; and the guiding words of training are the way of life. </span>
<span class='v PR6_24' data-id='PR6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>They will keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. </span>
<span class='v PR6_25' data-id='PR6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Let not your heart's desire go after her fair body; let not her eyes take you prisoner. </span>
<span class='v PR6_26' data-id='PR6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For a loose woman is looking for a cake of bread, but another man's wife goes after one's very life. </span>
<span class='v PR6_27' data-id='PR6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>May a man take fire to his breast without burning his clothing? </span>
<span class='v PR6_28' data-id='PR6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Or may one go on lighted coals, and his feet not be burned? </span>
<span class='v PR6_29' data-id='PR6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So it is with him who goes in to his neighbour's wife; he who has anything to do with her will not go free from punishment. </span>
<span class='v PR6_30' data-id='PR6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Men do not have a low opinion of a thief who takes food when he is in need of it: </span>
<span class='v PR6_31' data-id='PR6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But if he is taken in the act he will have to give back seven times as much, giving up all his property which is in his house. </span>
<span class='v PR6_32' data-id='PR6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He who takes another man's wife is without all sense: he who does it is the cause of destruction to his soul. </span>
<span class='v PR6_33' data-id='PR6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Wounds will be his and loss of honour, and his shame may not be washed away. </span>
<span class='v PR6_34' data-id='PR6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For bitter is the wrath of an angry husband; in the day of punishment he will have no mercy. </span>
<span class='v PR6_35' data-id='PR6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He will not take any payment; and he will not make peace with you though your money offerings are increased. </span></div></div>
