<span class='v DT16_3' data-id='DT16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Take no leavened bread with it; for seven days let your food be unleavened bread, that is, the bread of sorrow; for you came out of the land of Egypt quickly: so the memory of that day, when you came out of the land of Egypt, will be with you all your life. </span>
<span class='v DT16_4' data-id='DT16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For seven days let no leaven be used through all your land; and nothing of the flesh which is put to death in the evening of the first day is to be kept through the night till morning. </span>
