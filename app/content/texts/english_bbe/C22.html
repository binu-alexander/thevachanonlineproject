<span class='v C22_1' data-id='C22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But it was my decision for myself, not to come again to you with sorrow. </span>
<span class='v C22_2' data-id='C22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For if I give you sorrow, who then will make me glad, but he who is made sad by me? </span>
<span class='v C22_3' data-id='C22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I said this very thing in my letter, for fear that when I came I might have sorrow from those from whom it was right for me to have joy; being certain of this, that my joy is the joy of you all. </span>
<span class='v C22_4' data-id='C22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For out of much trouble and pain of heart and much weeping I sent my letter to you; not to give you sorrow, but so that you might see how great is the love which I have to you. </span>
<span class='v C22_5' data-id='C22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if anyone has been a cause of sorrow, he has been so, not to me only, but in some measure to all of you (I say this that I may not be over-hard on you). </span>
<span class='v C22_6' data-id='C22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let it be enough for such a man to have undergone the punishment which the church put on him; </span>
<span class='v C22_7' data-id='C22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So that now, on the other hand, it is right for him to have forgiveness and comfort from you, for fear that his sorrow may be over-great. </span>
<span class='v C22_8' data-id='C22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For which cause my desire is that you will make your love to him clear by your acts. </span>
<span class='v C22_9' data-id='C22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And for the same reason I sent you a letter so that I might be certain of your desire to do my orders in all things. </span>
<span class='v C22_10' data-id='C22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But if you give forgiveness to anyone, I do the same: for if I have given forgiveness for anything, I have done it because of you, in the person of Christ; </span>
<span class='v C22_11' data-id='C22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So that Satan may not get the better of us: for we are not without knowledge of his designs. </span>
<span class='v C22_12' data-id='C22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now when I came to Troas for the good news of Christ, and there was an open door for me in the Lord, </span>
<span class='v C22_13' data-id='C22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I had no rest in my spirit because Titus my brother was not there: so I went away from them, and came into Macedonia. </span>
<span class='v C22_14' data-id='C22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But praise be to God who makes us strong to overcome in Christ, and makes clear through us in every place the value of the knowledge of him. </span>
<span class='v C22_15' data-id='C22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we are a sweet perfume of Christ to God in those who are getting salvation and in those who are going to destruction; </span>
<span class='v C22_16' data-id='C22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To the one it is a perfume of death to death; to the other a perfume of life to life. And who is enough for such things? </span>
<span class='v C22_17' data-id='C22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For we are not like the great number who make use of the word of God for profit: but our words are true, as from God, being said as before God in Christ. </span></div></div>
