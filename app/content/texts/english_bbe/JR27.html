<span class='v JR27_1' data-id='JR27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, first became king this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR27_2' data-id='JR27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord has said to me: Make for yourself bands and yokes and put them on your neck; </span>
<span class='v JR27_3' data-id='JR27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by their servants who come to Jerusalem, to Zedekiah, king of Judah; </span>
<span class='v JR27_4' data-id='JR27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And give them orders to say to their masters, This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: Say to your masters, </span>
<span class='v JR27_5' data-id='JR27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I have made the earth, and man and beast on the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I will give it to anyone at my pleasure. </span>
<span class='v JR27_6' data-id='JR27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And now I have given all these lands into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant; and I have given the beasts of the field to him for his use. </span>
<span class='v JR27_7' data-id='JR27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And all the nations will be servants to him and to his son and to his son's son, till the time comes for his land to be overcome: and then a number of nations and great kings will take it for their use. </span>
<span class='v JR27_8' data-id='JR27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And it will come about, that if any nation does not become a servant to this same Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, then I will send punishment on that nation, says the Lord, by the sword and need of food and by disease, till I have given them into his hands. </span>
<span class='v JR27_9' data-id='JR27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And you are not to give attention to your prophets or your readers of signs or your dreamers or those who see into the future or those who make use of secret arts, who say to you, You will not become servants of the king of Babylon: </span>
<span class='v JR27_10' data-id='JR27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For they say false words to you, so that you may be sent away far from your land, and so that you may be forced out by me and come to destruction. </span>
<span class='v JR27_11' data-id='JR27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But as for that nation which puts its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and becomes his servant, I will let that nation keep on in its land, farming it and living in it, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR27_12' data-id='JR27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I said all this to Zedekiah, king of Judah, saying, Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and become his servants and his people, so that you may keep your lives. </span>
<span class='v JR27_13' data-id='JR27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Why are you desiring death, you and your people, by the sword, and because food is gone, and by disease, as the Lord has said of the nation which does not become the servant of the king of Babylon? </span>
<span class='v JR27_14' data-id='JR27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And you are not to give ear to the prophets who say to you, You will not become servants of the king of Babylon: for what they say is not true. </span>
<span class='v JR27_15' data-id='JR27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For I have not sent them, says the Lord, but they are saying what is false in my name, so that I might send you out by force, causing destruction to come on you and on your prophets. </span>
<span class='v JR27_16' data-id='JR27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I said to the priests and to all the people, This is what the Lord has said: Give no attention to the words of your prophets who say to you, See, in a very little time now the vessels of the Lord's house will come back again from Babylon: for what they say to you is false. </span>
<span class='v JR27_17' data-id='JR27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Give no attention to them; become servants of the king of Babylon and keep yourselves from death: why let this town become a waste? </span>
<span class='v JR27_18' data-id='JR27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But if they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them, let them now make request to the Lord of armies that the vessels which are still in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem, may not go to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR27_19' data-id='JR27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said about the rest of the vessels which are still in this town, </span>
<span class='v JR27_20' data-id='JR27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Which Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, did not take away, when he took Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylon, with all the great men of Judah and Jerusalem; </span>
<span class='v JR27_21' data-id='JR27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said about the rest of the vessels in the house of the Lord and in the house of the king of Judah and at Jerusalem: </span>
<span class='v JR27_22' data-id='JR27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They will be taken away to Babylon, and there they will be till the day when I send their punishment on them, says the Lord. Then I will take them up and put them back in their place. </span></div></div>
