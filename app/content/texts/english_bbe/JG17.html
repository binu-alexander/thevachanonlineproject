<span class='v JG17_1' data-id='JG17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim named Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_2' data-id='JG17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you, about which you took an oath and said in my hearing, I have given this silver to the Lord from my hand for myself, to make a pictured image and a metal image: see, I have the silver, for I took it: so now I will give it back to you. And his mother said, May the blessing of the Lord be on my son. </span>
<span class='v JG17_3' data-id='JG17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, and his mother said, I have made the silver holy to the Lord from me for my son, to make a pictured image and a metal image. </span>
<span class='v JG17_4' data-id='JG17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So he gave the silver back to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal-worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them: and it was in the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_5' data-id='JG17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest. </span>
<span class='v JG17_6' data-id='JG17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did as seemed right to him. </span>
<span class='v JG17_7' data-id='JG17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now there was a young man living in Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah and a Levite, who was not a townsman of the place. </span>
<span class='v JG17_8' data-id='JG17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he went away from the town of Beth-lehem-judah, looking for somewhere to make his living-place; and on his journey he came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_9' data-id='JG17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Beth-lehem-judah, and I am looking for a living-place. </span>
<span class='v JG17_10' data-id='JG17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Micah said to him, Make your living-place with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food. </span>
<span class='v JG17_11' data-id='JG17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the Levite said he would make his living-place with the man, and he became to him as one of his sons. </span>
<span class='v JG17_12' data-id='JG17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Micah gave the position to the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_13' data-id='JG17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Micah said, Now I am certain that the Lord will do me good, seeing that the Levite has become my priest. </span></div></div>
