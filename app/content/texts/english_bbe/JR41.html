<span class='v JR41_1' data-id='JR41_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now it came about in the seventh month that Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the king's seed, having with him ten men, came to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, in Mizpah; and they had a meal together in Mizpah. </span>
<span class='v JR41_2' data-id='JR41_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men who were with him, got up, and attacking Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, put to death him whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land. </span>
<span class='v JR41_3' data-id='JR41_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Ishmael put to death all the Jews who were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldaean men of war. </span>
<span class='v JR41_4' data-id='JR41_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now on the second day after he had put Gedaliah to death, when no one had knowledge of it, </span>
<span class='v JR41_5' data-id='JR41_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Some people came from Shechem, from Shiloh and Samaria, eighty men, with the hair of their faces cut off and their clothing out of order, and with cuts on their bodies, and in their hands meal offerings and perfumes which they were taking to the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR41_6' data-id='JR41_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, went out from Mizpah with the purpose of meeting them, weeping on his way: and it came about that when he was face to face with them he said, Come to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam. </span>
<span class='v JR41_7' data-id='JR41_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when they came inside the town, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and the men who were with him, put them to death and put their bodies into a deep hole. </span>
<span class='v JR41_8' data-id='JR41_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, Do not put us to death, for we have secret stores, in the country, of grain and oil and honey. So he did not put them to death with their countrymen. </span>
<span class='v JR41_9' data-id='JR41_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now the hole into which Ishmael had put the dead bodies of the men whom he had put to death, was the great hole which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha, king of Israel: and Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, made it full of the bodies of those who had been put to death. </span>
<span class='v JR41_10' data-id='JR41_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Ishmael took away as prisoners all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, the king's daughters and all the people still in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, had put under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam: Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, took them away prisoners with the purpose of going over to the children of Ammon. </span>
<span class='v JR41_11' data-id='JR41_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But when Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the armed forces who were with him, had news of all the evil which Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had done, </span>
<span class='v JR41_12' data-id='JR41_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They took their men and went out to make war on Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and they came face to face with him by the great waters in Gibeon. </span>
<span class='v JR41_13' data-id='JR41_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces with him, then they were glad. </span>
<span class='v JR41_14' data-id='JR41_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And all the people whom Ishmael had taken away prisoners from Mizpah, turning round, came back and went to Johanan, the son of Kareah. </span>
<span class='v JR41_15' data-id='JR41_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, got away from Johanan, with eight men, and went to the children of Ammon. </span>
<span class='v JR41_16' data-id='JR41_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Johanan, the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, took all the rest of the people whom Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had made prisoners, after he had put to death Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the people from Mizpah, that is, the men of war and the women and the children and the unsexed servants, whom he had taken back with him from Gibeon: </span>
<span class='v JR41_17' data-id='JR41_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they went and were living in the resting-place of Chimham, which is near Beth-lehem on the way into Egypt, </span>
<span class='v JR41_18' data-id='JR41_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Because of the Chaldaeans: for they were in fear of them because Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, had put to death Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land. </span></div></div>
