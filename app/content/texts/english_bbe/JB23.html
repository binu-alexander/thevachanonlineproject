<span class='v JB23_1' data-id='JB23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB23_2' data-id='JB23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Even today my outcry is bitter; his hand is hard on my sorrow. </span>
<span class='v JB23_3' data-id='JB23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If only I had knowledge of where he might be seen, so that I might come even to his seat! </span>
<span class='v JB23_4' data-id='JB23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I would put my cause in order before him, and my mouth would be full of arguments. </span>
<span class='v JB23_5' data-id='JB23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I would see what his answers would be, and have knowledge of what he would say to me. </span>
<span class='v JB23_6' data-id='JB23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Would he make use of his great power to overcome me? No, but he would give attention to me. </span>
<span class='v JB23_7' data-id='JB23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There an upright man might put his cause before him; and I would be free for ever from my judge. </span>
<span class='v JB23_8' data-id='JB23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>See, I go forward, but he is not there; and back, but I do not see him; </span>
<span class='v JB23_9' data-id='JB23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I am looking for him on the left hand, but there is no sign of him; and turning to the right, I am not able to see him. </span>
<span class='v JB23_10' data-id='JB23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he has knowledge of the way I take; after I have been tested I will come out like gold. </span>
<span class='v JB23_11' data-id='JB23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My feet have gone in his steps; I have kept in his way, without turning to one side or to the other. </span>
<span class='v JB23_12' data-id='JB23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I have never gone against the orders of his lips; the words of his mouth have been stored up in my heart. </span>
<span class='v JB23_13' data-id='JB23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But his purpose is fixed and there is no changing it; and he gives effect to the desire of his soul. </span>
<span class='v JB23_14' data-id='JB23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For what has been ordered for me by him will be gone through to the end: and his mind is full of such designs. </span>
<span class='v JB23_15' data-id='JB23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this cause I am in fear before him, my thoughts of him overcome me. </span>
<span class='v JB23_16' data-id='JB23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For God has made my heart feeble, and my mind is troubled before the Ruler of all. </span>
<span class='v JB23_17' data-id='JB23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For I am overcome by the dark, and by the black night which is covering my face. </span></div></div>
