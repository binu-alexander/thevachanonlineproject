<span class='v JB13_1' data-id='JB13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Truly, my eye has seen all this, word of it has come to my ear, and I have knowledge of it. </span>
<span class='v JB13_2' data-id='JB13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The same things are in my mind as in yours; I am equal to you. </span>
<span class='v JB13_3' data-id='JB13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I would have talk with the Ruler of all, and my desire is to have an argument with God. </span>
<span class='v JB13_4' data-id='JB13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you put a false face on things; all your attempts to put things right are of no value. </span>
<span class='v JB13_5' data-id='JB13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If only you would keep quiet, it would be a sign of wisdom! </span>
<span class='v JB13_6' data-id='JB13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Give ear to the argument of my mouth, and take note of the words of my lips. </span>
<span class='v JB13_7' data-id='JB13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Will you say in God's name what is not right, and put false words into his mouth? </span>
<span class='v JB13_8' data-id='JB13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Will you have respect for God's person in this cause, and put yourselves forward as his supporters? </span>
<span class='v JB13_9' data-id='JB13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Will it be good for you to be searched out by him, or have you the thought that he may be guided into error like a man? </span>
<span class='v JB13_10' data-id='JB13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He will certainly put you right, if you have respect for persons in secret. </span>
<span class='v JB13_11' data-id='JB13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Will not his glory put you in fear, so that your hearts will be overcome before him? </span>
<span class='v JB13_12' data-id='JB13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Your wise sayings are only dust, and your strong places are only earth. </span>
<span class='v JB13_13' data-id='JB13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Keep quiet, and let me say what is in my mind, whatever may come to me. </span>
<span class='v JB13_14' data-id='JB13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand. </span>
<span class='v JB13_15' data-id='JB13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Truly, he will put an end to me; I have no hope; but I will not give way in argument before him; </span>
<span class='v JB13_16' data-id='JB13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And that will be my salvation, for an evil-doer would not come before him, </span>
<span class='v JB13_17' data-id='JB13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Give ear with care to my words, and keep what I say in your minds. </span>
<span class='v JB13_18' data-id='JB13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>See now, I have put my cause in order, and I am certain that I will be seen to be right. </span>
<span class='v JB13_19' data-id='JB13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Is any one able to take up the argument against me? If so, I would keep quiet and give up my breath. </span>
<span class='v JB13_20' data-id='JB13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Only two things do not do to me, then I will come before your face: </span>
<span class='v JB13_21' data-id='JB13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Take your hand far away from me; and let me not be overcome by fear of you. </span>
<span class='v JB13_22' data-id='JB13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then at the sound of your voice I will give answer; or let me put forward my cause for you to give me an answer. </span>
<span class='v JB13_23' data-id='JB13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>What is the number of my evil-doings and my sins? give me knowledge of them. </span>
<span class='v JB13_24' data-id='JB13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Why is your face veiled from me, as if I was numbered among your haters? </span>
<span class='v JB13_25' data-id='JB13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Will you be hard on a leaf in flight before the wind? will you make a dry stem go more quickly on its way? </span>
<span class='v JB13_26' data-id='JB13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For you put bitter things on record against me, and send punishment on me for the sins of my early years; </span>
<span class='v JB13_27' data-id='JB13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And you put chains on my feet, watching all my ways, and making a limit for my steps; </span>
<span class='v JB13_28' data-id='JB13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Though a man comes to nothing like a bit of dead wood, or like a robe which has become food for the worm. </span></div></div>
