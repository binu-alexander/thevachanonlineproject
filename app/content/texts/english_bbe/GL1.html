</div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_1' data-id='GL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an Apostle (not from men, and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who made him come back from the dead), </span>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia: </span>
<span class='v GL1_3' data-id='GL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v GL1_4' data-id='GL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Who gave himself for our sins, so that he might make us free from this present evil world, after the purpose of our God and Father: </span>
<span class='v GL1_5' data-id='GL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it. </span>
<span class='v GL1_6' data-id='GL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort; </span>
<span class='v GL1_7' data-id='GL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_8' data-id='GL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him. </span>
<span class='v GL1_9' data-id='GL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him. </span>
<span class='v GL1_10' data-id='GL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_11' data-id='GL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man's. </span>
<span class='v GL1_12' data-id='GL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_13' data-id='GL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews' religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it: </span>
<span class='v GL1_14' data-id='GL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I went farther in the Jews' religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers. </span>
<span class='v GL1_15' data-id='GL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother's body, through his grace, </span>
<span class='v GL1_16' data-id='GL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood, </span>
<span class='v GL1_17' data-id='GL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus. </span>
<span class='v GL1_18' data-id='GL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days. </span>
<span class='v GL1_19' data-id='GL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord's brother. </span>
<span class='v GL1_20' data-id='GL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true. </span>
<span class='v GL1_21' data-id='GL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v GL1_22' data-id='GL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person: </span>
<span class='v GL1_23' data-id='GL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him; </span>
<span class='v GL1_24' data-id='GL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they gave glory to God in me. </span></div></div>
