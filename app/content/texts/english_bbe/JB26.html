<span class='v JB26_2' data-id='JB26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>How have you given help to him who has no power! how have you been the salvation of the arm which has no strength! </span>
<span class='v JB26_3' data-id='JB26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>How have you given teaching to him who has no wisdom, and fully made clear true knowledge! </span>
<span class='v JB26_4' data-id='JB26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>To whom have your words been said? and whose spirit came out from you? </span>
<span class='v JB26_5' data-id='JB26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The shades in the underworld are shaking; the waters and those living in them. </span>
<span class='v JB26_6' data-id='JB26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The underworld is uncovered before him, and Destruction has no veil. </span>
<span class='v JB26_7' data-id='JB26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>By his hand the north is stretched out in space, and the earth is hanging on nothing. </span>
<span class='v JB26_8' data-id='JB26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>By him the waters are shut up in his thick clouds, and the cloud does not give way under them. </span>
<span class='v JB26_9' data-id='JB26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>By him the face of his high seat is veiled, and his cloud stretched out over it. </span>
<span class='v JB26_10' data-id='JB26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>By him a circle is marked out on the face of the waters, to the limits of the light and the dark. </span>

<span class='v JB26_12' data-id='JB26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>By his power the sea was made quiet; and by his wisdom Rahab was wounded. </span>
<span class='v JB26_13' data-id='JB26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>By his wind the heavens become bright: by his hand the quickly moving snake was cut through. </span>
