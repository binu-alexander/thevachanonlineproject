<span class='v GN21_1' data-id='GN21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the Lord came to Sarah as he had said and did to her as he had undertaken. </span>
<span class='v GN21_2' data-id='GN21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Sarah became with child, and gave Abraham a son when he was old, at the time named by God. </span>
<span class='v GN21_3' data-id='GN21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Abraham gave to his son, to whom Sarah had given birth, the name Isaac. </span>
<span class='v GN21_4' data-id='GN21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham made him undergo circumcision, as God had said to him. </span>
<span class='v GN21_5' data-id='GN21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham was a hundred years old when the birth of Isaac took place. </span>
<span class='v GN21_6' data-id='GN21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Sarah said, God has given me cause for laughing, and everyone who has news of it will be laughing with me. </span>
<span class='v GN21_7' data-id='GN21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And she said, Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would have a child at her breast? for see, I have given him a son now when he is old. </span>
<span class='v GN21_8' data-id='GN21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when the child was old enough to be taken from the breast, Abraham made a great feast. </span>
<span class='v GN21_9' data-id='GN21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian playing with Isaac. </span>
<span class='v GN21_10' data-id='GN21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So she said to Abraham, Send away that woman and her son: for the son of that woman is not to have a part in the heritage with my son Isaac. </span>
<span class='v GN21_11' data-id='GN21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And this was a great grief to Abraham because of his son. </span>
<span class='v GN21_12' data-id='GN21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But God said, Let it not be a grief to you because of the boy and Hagar his mother; give ear to whatever Sarah says to you, because it is from Isaac that your seed will take its name. </span>
<span class='v GN21_13' data-id='GN21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I will make a nation of the son of your servant-woman, because he is your seed. </span>
<span class='v GN21_14' data-id='GN21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning Abraham got up, and gave Hagar some bread and a water-skin, and put the boy on her back, and sent her away: and she went, wandering in the waste land of Beer-sheba. </span>
<span class='v GN21_15' data-id='GN21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And when all the water in the skin was used up, she put the child down under a tree. </span>
<span class='v GN21_16' data-id='GN21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And she went some distance away, about an arrow flight, and seating herself on the earth, she gave way to bitter weeping, saying, Let me not see the death of my child. </span>
<span class='v GN21_17' data-id='GN21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the boy's cry came to the ears of God; and the angel of God said to Hagar from heaven, Hagar, why are you weeping? have no fear, for the child's cry has come to the ears of God. </span>
<span class='v GN21_18' data-id='GN21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Come, take your child in your arms, for I will make of him a great nation. </span>
<span class='v GN21_19' data-id='GN21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then God made her eyes open, and she saw a water-spring, and she got water in the skin and gave the boy a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN21_20' data-id='GN21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And God was with the boy, and he became tall and strong, and he became a bowman, living in the waste land. </span>
<span class='v GN21_21' data-id='GN21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And while he was in the waste land of Paran, his mother got him a wife from the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v GN21_22' data-id='GN21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now at that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, said to Abraham, I see that God is with you in all you do. </span>
<span class='v GN21_23' data-id='GN21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now, then, give me your oath, in the name of God, that you will not be false to me or to my sons after me, but that as I have been good to you, so you will be to me and to this land where you have been living. </span>
<span class='v GN21_24' data-id='GN21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said, I will give you my oath. </span>
<span class='v GN21_25' data-id='GN21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Abraham made a protest to Abimelech because of a water-hole which Abimelech's servants had taken by force. </span>
<span class='v GN21_26' data-id='GN21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Abimelech said, I have no idea who has done this thing; you never gave me word of it, and I had no knowledge of it till this day. </span>
<span class='v GN21_27' data-id='GN21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made an agreement together. </span>
<span class='v GN21_28' data-id='GN21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Abraham put seven young lambs of the flock on one side by themselves. </span>
<span class='v GN21_29' data-id='GN21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech said, What are these seven lambs which you have put on one side? </span>
<span class='v GN21_30' data-id='GN21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And he said, Take these seven lambs from me as a witness that I have made this water-hole. </span>
<span class='v GN21_31' data-id='GN21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So he gave that place the name Beer-sheba, because there the two of them had given their oaths. </span>
<span class='v GN21_32' data-id='GN21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So they made an agreement at Beer-sheba, and Abimelech and Phicol, the captain of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v GN21_33' data-id='GN21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And Abraham, after planting a holy tree in Beer-sheba, gave worship to the name of the Lord, the Eternal God. </span>
<span class='v GN21_34' data-id='GN21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Abraham went on living in the land of the Philistines as in a strange country. </span></div></div>
