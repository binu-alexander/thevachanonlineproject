<span class='v GN9_2' data-id='GN9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the fear of you will be strong in every beast of the earth and every bird of the air; everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands. </span>
<span class='v GN9_3' data-id='GN9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things. </span>

<span class='v GN9_5' data-id='GN9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man. </span>
<span class='v GN9_6' data-id='GN9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image. </span>

<span class='v GN9_23' data-id='GN9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed. </span>
<span class='v GN9_24' data-id='GN9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said, </span>
