<span class='v SS2_2' data-id='SS2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As the lily-flower among the thorns of the waste, so is my love among the daughters. </span>
<span class='v SS2_3' data-id='SS2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my loved one among the sons. I took my rest under his shade with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. </span>
<span class='v SS2_4' data-id='SS2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He took me to the house of wine, and his flag over me was love. </span>

<span class='v SS2_8' data-id='SS2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The voice of my loved one! See, he comes dancing on the mountains, stepping quickly on the hills. </span>
<span class='v SS2_9' data-id='SS2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>My loved one is like a roe; see, he is on the other side of our wall, he is looking in at the windows, letting himself be seen through the spaces. </span>
<span class='v SS2_10' data-id='SS2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>My loved one said to me, Get up, my love, my fair one, and come away. </span>

<span class='v SS2_12' data-id='SS2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The flowers are come on the earth; the time of cutting the vines is come, and the voice of the dove is sounding in our land; </span>
<span class='v SS2_13' data-id='SS2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The fig-tree puts out her green fruit and the vines with their young fruit give a good smell. Get up from your bed, my beautiful one, and come away. </span>

<span class='v SS2_15' data-id='SS2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Take for us the foxes, the little foxes, which do damage to the vines; our vines have young grapes. </span>
