<span class='v SS6_1' data-id='SS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Where is your loved one gone, O most fair among women? Where is your loved one turned away, that we may go looking for him with you? </span>
<span class='v SS6_2' data-id='SS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>My loved one is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to take food in the gardens, and to get lilies. </span>
<span class='v SS6_3' data-id='SS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I am for my loved one, and my loved one is for me; he takes food among the lilies. </span>
<span class='v SS6_4' data-id='SS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, as fair as Jerusalem; you are to be feared like an army with flags. </span>
<span class='v SS6_5' data-id='SS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let your eyes be turned away from me; see, they have overcome me; your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of Gilead. </span>
<span class='v SS6_6' data-id='SS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young. </span>

<span class='v SS6_11' data-id='SS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley, and to see if the vine was in bud, and the pomegranate-trees were in flower. </span>
