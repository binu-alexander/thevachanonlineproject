<span class='v S18_1' data-id='S18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when Samuel was old, he made his sons judges over Israel. </span>
<span class='v S18_2' data-id='S18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The name of his first son was Joel and the name of his second Abijah: they were judges in Beer-sheba. </span>
<span class='v S18_3' data-id='S18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And his sons did not go in his ways, but moved by the love of money took rewards, and were not upright in judging. </span>
<span class='v S18_4' data-id='S18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then all the responsible men of Israel got together and went to Samuel at Ramah, </span>
<span class='v S18_5' data-id='S18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And said to him, See now, you are old, and your sons do not go in your ways: give us a king now to be our judge, so that we may be like the other nations. </span>
<span class='v S18_6' data-id='S18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Samuel was not pleased when they said to him, Give us a king to be our judge. And Samuel made prayer to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v S18_7' data-id='S18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to the voice of the people and what they say to you: they have not been turned away from you, but they have been turned away from me, not desiring me to be king over them. </span>
<span class='v S18_8' data-id='S18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>As they have done from the first, from the day when I took them out of Egypt till this day, turning away from me and worshipping other gods, so now they are acting in the same way to you. </span>
<span class='v S18_9' data-id='S18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Give ear now to their voice: but make a serious protest to them, and give them a picture of the sort of king who will be their ruler. </span>
<span class='v S18_10' data-id='S18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said all these words of the Lord to the people who were desiring a king. </span>
<span class='v S18_11' data-id='S18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he said, This is the sort of king who will be your ruler: he will take your sons and make them his servants, his horsemen, and drivers of his war-carriages, and they will go running before his war-carriages; </span>
<span class='v S18_12' data-id='S18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he will make them captains of thousands and of fifties; some he will put to work ploughing and cutting his grain and making his instruments of war and building his war-carriages. </span>
<span class='v S18_13' data-id='S18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Your daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread-makers. </span>
<span class='v S18_14' data-id='S18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He will take your fields and your vine-gardens and your olive-gardens, all the best of them, and give them to his servants. </span>
<span class='v S18_15' data-id='S18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He will take a tenth of your seed and of the fruit of your vines and give it to his servants. </span>
<span class='v S18_16' data-id='S18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He will take your men-servants and your servant-girls, and the best of your oxen and your asses and put them to his work. </span>
<span class='v S18_17' data-id='S18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He will take a tenth of your sheep: and you will be his servants. </span>
<span class='v S18_18' data-id='S18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then you will be crying out because of your king whom you have taken for yourselves; but the Lord will not give you an answer in that day. </span>
<span class='v S18_19' data-id='S18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But the people gave no attention to the voice of Samuel; and they said, No, but we will have a king over us, </span>
<span class='v S18_20' data-id='S18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So that we may be like the other nations, and so that our king may be our judge and go out before us to war. </span>
<span class='v S18_21' data-id='S18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Samuel, after hearing all the people had to say, went and gave an account of it to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v S18_22' data-id='S18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Samuel, Give ear to their voice and make a king for them. Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let every man go back to his town. </span></div></div>
