<span class='v T24_1' data-id='T24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I give you orders, before God and Christ Jesus, who will be the judge of the living and the dead, and by his revelation and his kingdom; </span>
<span class='v T24_2' data-id='T24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Be preaching the word at all times, in every place; make protests, say sharp words, give comfort, with long waiting and teaching; </span>
<span class='v T24_3' data-id='T24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the time will come when they will not take the true teaching; but, moved by their desires, they will get for themselves a great number of teachers for the pleasure of hearing them; </span>
<span class='v T24_4' data-id='T24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And shutting their ears to what is true, will be turned away to belief in foolish stories. </span>
<span class='v T24_5' data-id='T24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But be self-controlled in all things, do without comfort, go on preaching the good news, completing the work which has been given you to do. </span>
<span class='v T24_6' data-id='T24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I am even now being offered, and my end is near. </span>
<span class='v T24_7' data-id='T24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have made a good fight, I have come to the end of my journey, I have kept the faith: </span>
<span class='v T24_8' data-id='T24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>From now on, the crown of righteousness is made ready for me, which the Lord, the upright judge, Will give to me at that day: and not only to me, but to all those who have had love for his revelation. </span>
<span class='v T24_9' data-id='T24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do your best to come to me before long: </span>
<span class='v T24_10' data-id='T24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For Demas has gone away from me, for love of this present life, and has gone to Thessalonica: Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. </span>
<span class='v T24_11' data-id='T24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and take him with you; for he is of use to me in the work. </span>
<span class='v T24_12' data-id='T24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Tychicus I sent to Ephesus. </span>
<span class='v T24_13' data-id='T24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The coat which I did not take from Troas and which is with Carpus, get when you come, and the books, specially the papers. </span>
<span class='v T24_14' data-id='T24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Alexander the copper-worker did me much wrong: the Lord will give him the reward of his works: </span>
<span class='v T24_15' data-id='T24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But be on the watch for him, for he was violent in his attacks on our teaching. </span>
<span class='v T24_16' data-id='T24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At my first meeting with my judges, no one took my part, but all went away from me. May it not be put to their account. </span>
<span class='v T24_17' data-id='T24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord was by my side and gave me strength; so that through me the news might be given out in full measure, and all the Gentiles might give ear: and I was taken out of the mouth of the lion. </span>
<span class='v T24_18' data-id='T24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Lord will keep me safe from every evil work and will give me salvation in his kingdom in heaven: to whom be glory for ever and ever. So be it. </span>
<span class='v T24_19' data-id='T24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Give my love to Prisca and Aquila and those of the house of Onesiphorus. </span>
<span class='v T24_20' data-id='T24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Erastus was stopping at Corinth; but Trophimus, when I last saw him was at Miletus, ill. </span>
<span class='v T24_21' data-id='T24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do your best to come before the winter. Eubulus sends you his love, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia, and all the brothers. </span>
<span class='v T24_22' data-id='T24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you. </span></div></div>
