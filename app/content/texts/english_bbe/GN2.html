<span class='v GN2_3' data-id='GN2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And God gave his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy: because on that day he took his rest from all the work which he had made and done. </span>

<span class='v GN2_5' data-id='GN2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the day when the Lord God made earth and heaven there were no plants of the field on the earth, and no grass had come up: for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to do work on the land. </span>
<span class='v GN2_6' data-id='GN2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But a mist went up from the earth, watering all the face of the land. </span>
<span class='v GN2_7' data-id='GN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Lord God made man from the dust of the earth, breathing into him the breath of life: and man became a living soul. </span>

<span class='v GN2_17' data-id='GN2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you may not take; for on the day when you take of it, death will certainly come to you. </span>
<span class='v GN2_18' data-id='GN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the Lord God said, It is not good for the man to be by himself: I will make one like himself as a help to him </span>
<span class='v GN2_19' data-id='GN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And from the earth the Lord God made every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and took them to the man to see what names he would give them: and whatever name he gave to any living thing, that was its name. </span>
<span class='v GN2_20' data-id='GN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of the air and to every beast of the field; but Adam had no one like himself as a help. </span>
<span class='v GN2_21' data-id='GN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the Lord God sent a deep sleep on the man, and took one of the bones from his side while he was sleeping, joining up the flesh again in its place: </span>
<span class='v GN2_22' data-id='GN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the bone which the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman, and took her to the man. </span>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the man said, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: let her name be Woman because she was taken out of Man. </span>
