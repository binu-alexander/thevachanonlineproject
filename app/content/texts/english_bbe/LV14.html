<span class='v LV14_2' data-id='LV14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is the law of the leper on the day when he is made clean: he is to be taken to the priest; </span>
<span class='v LV14_3' data-id='LV14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to go outside the tent-circle; and if, after looking, the priest sees that the mark of the disease has gone from him, </span>
<span class='v LV14_4' data-id='LV14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the priest is to give orders to take, for him who is to be made clean, two living clean birds and some cedar wood and red thread and hyssop. </span>
<span class='v LV14_5' data-id='LV14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the priest will give orders for one of the birds to be put to death in a vessel made of earth, over flowing water. </span>
<span class='v LV14_6' data-id='LV14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he will take the living bird and the wood and the red thread and the hyssop and put them in the blood of the bird which was put to death over flowing water. </span>
<span class='v LV14_7' data-id='LV14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And shaking it seven times over the man who is to be made clean, he will say that he is clean and will let the living bird go free into the open country. </span>
<span class='v LV14_8' data-id='LV14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he who is to be made clean will have his clothing washed and his hair cut and have a bath, and he will be clean. And after that he will come back to the tent-circle; but he is to keep outside his tent for seven days. </span>
<span class='v LV14_9' data-id='LV14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day he is to have all the hair cut off his head and his chin and over his eyes — all his hair is to be cut off — and he will have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and he will be clean. </span>
<span class='v LV14_10' data-id='LV14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day let him take two male lambs, without any marks on them, and one female lamb of the first year, without a mark, and three tenth parts of an ephah of the best meal, mixed with oil, and one log of oil. </span>
<span class='v LV14_11' data-id='LV14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the priest who is making him clean will put the man who is being made clean, together with these things, before the door of the Tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v LV14_12' data-id='LV14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to take one of the male lambs and give it as an offering for wrongdoing, and the log of oil, waving them for a wave offering before the Lord; </span>

<span class='v LV14_14' data-id='LV14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And let the priest take some of the blood of the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the point of the right ear of him who is to be made clean, and on the thumb of his right hand and on the great toe of his right foot; </span>

<span class='v LV14_18' data-id='LV14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the oil in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be made clean; and so the priest will make him free from sin before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV14_19' data-id='LV14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the priest will give the sin-offering, and take away the sin of him who is to be made clean from his unclean condition; and after that he will put the burned offering to death. </span>
<span class='v LV14_20' data-id='LV14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the priest is to have the burned offering and the meal offering burned on the altar; and the priest will take away his sin and he will be clean. </span>
<span class='v LV14_21' data-id='LV14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And if he is poor and not able to get so much, then he may take one male lamb as an offering for wrongdoing, to be waved to take away his sin, and one tenth part of an ephah of the best meal mixed with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil; </span>
<span class='v LV14_22' data-id='LV14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And two doves or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and one will be for a sin-offering and the other for a burned offering. </span>

<span class='v LV14_26' data-id='LV14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the priest will put out some of the oil in the hollow of his left hand, </span>

<span class='v LV14_29' data-id='LV14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the oil which is in the priest's hand he will put on the head of him who is to be made clean, to take away his sin before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV14_30' data-id='LV14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And he will make an offering of one of the doves or the young pigeons, such as he is able to get; </span>

<span class='v LV14_32' data-id='LV14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is the law for the man who has the disease of the leper on him, and who is not able to get that which is necessary for making himself clean. </span>
<span class='v LV14_33' data-id='LV14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, </span>
<span class='v LV14_34' data-id='LV14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When you have come into the land of Canaan which I will give you for your heritage, if I put the leper's disease on a house in the land of your heritage, </span>
<span class='v LV14_35' data-id='LV14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then let the owner of the house come and say to the priest, It seems to me that there is a sort of leper's disease in the house. </span>
<span class='v LV14_36' data-id='LV14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And the priest will give orders for everything to be taken out of the house, before he goes in to see the disease, so that the things in the house may not become unclean; and then the priest is to go in to see the house; </span>
<span class='v LV14_37' data-id='LV14_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And if he sees that the walls of the house are marked with hollows of green and red, and if it seems to go deeper than the face of the wall; </span>
<span class='v LV14_38' data-id='LV14_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then the priest will go out of the door of the house, and keep the house shut up for seven days: </span>

<span class='v LV14_48' data-id='LV14_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And if the priest comes in, and sees that the disease is not increased after the new paste has been put on the house, then the priest will say that the house is clean, because the disease is gone. </span>
<span class='v LV14_49' data-id='LV14_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And in order to make the house clean, let him take two birds and cedar-wood and red thread and hyssop; </span>
