<span class='v NU9_1' data-id='NU9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, in the waste land of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, </span>
<span class='v NU9_2' data-id='NU9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Let the children of Israel keep the Passover at its regular time. </span>
<span class='v NU9_3' data-id='NU9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you are to keep it at the regular time, and in the way ordered in the law. </span>
<span class='v NU9_4' data-id='NU9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Moses gave orders to the children of Israel to keep the Passover. </span>
<span class='v NU9_5' data-id='NU9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the waste land of Sinai: as the Lord gave orders to Moses, so the children of Israel did. </span>
<span class='v NU9_6' data-id='NU9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And there were certain men who were unclean because of a dead body, so that they were not able to keep the Passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: </span>
<span class='v NU9_7' data-id='NU9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And these men said to him, We have been made unclean by the dead body of a man; why may we not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time among the children of Israel? </span>
<span class='v NU9_8' data-id='NU9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to them, Do nothing till the Lord gives me directions about you. </span>
<span class='v NU9_9' data-id='NU9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU9_10' data-id='NU9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Say to the children of Israel, If any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, still he is to keep the Passover to the Lord: </span>
<span class='v NU9_11' data-id='NU9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In the second month, on the fourteenth day, in the evening, they are to keep it, taking it with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants; </span>
<span class='v NU9_12' data-id='NU9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Nothing of it is to be kept till the morning, and no bone of it is to be broken: they are to keep it by the rules of the Passover. </span>
<span class='v NU9_13' data-id='NU9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the man who, not being unclean or on a journey, does not keep the Passover, will be cut off from his people: because he did not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time, his sin will be on him. </span>
<span class='v NU9_14' data-id='NU9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let him do as is ordered in the law of the Passover: there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land. </span>
<span class='v NU9_15' data-id='NU9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And on the day when the House was put up, the cloud came down on it, on the Tent of witness; and in the evening there was a light like fire over the House till the morning. </span>
<span class='v NU9_16' data-id='NU9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And so it was at all times: it was covered by the cloud, and by a light as of fire by night. </span>
<span class='v NU9_17' data-id='NU9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the House, then the children of Israel went journeying on; and in the place where the cloud came to rest, there the children of Israel put up their tents. </span>
<span class='v NU9_18' data-id='NU9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>At the order of the Lord the children of Israel went forward, and at the order of the Lord they put up their tents: as long as the cloud was resting on the House, they did not go away from that place. </span>
<span class='v NU9_19' data-id='NU9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When the cloud was resting on the House for a long time the children of Israel, waiting for the order of the Lord, did not go on. </span>
<span class='v NU9_20' data-id='NU9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Sometimes the cloud was resting on the House for two or three days; then, by the order of the Lord, they kept their tents in that place, and when the Lord gave the order they went on. </span>
<span class='v NU9_21' data-id='NU9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again: or if it was resting there by day and by night, whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward. </span>
<span class='v NU9_22' data-id='NU9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Or if the cloud came to rest on the House for two days or a month or a year without moving, the children of Israel went on waiting there and did not go on; but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey. </span>
<span class='v NU9_23' data-id='NU9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>At the word of the Lord they put up their tents, and at the word of the Lord they went forward on their journey: they kept the orders of the Lord as he gave them by Moses. </span></div></div>
