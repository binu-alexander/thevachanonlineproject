<span class='v JH4_1' data-id='JH4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he was angry. </span>
<span class='v JH4_2' data-id='JH4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my country? This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish: for I was certain that you were a loving God, full of pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil. </span>
<span class='v JH4_3' data-id='JH4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and take my life from me; for death is better for me than life. </span>
<span class='v JH4_4' data-id='JH4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry? </span>
<span class='v JH4_5' data-id='JH4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jonah went out of the town, and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town. </span>
<span class='v JH4_6' data-id='JH4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because of the vine. </span>
<span class='v JH4_7' data-id='JH4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But early on the morning after, God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and dead. </span>
<span class='v JH4_8' data-id='JH4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then when the sun came up, God sent a burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is better for me than life. </span>
<span class='v JH4_9' data-id='JH4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be truly angry. </span>
<span class='v JH4_10' data-id='JH4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, You had pity on the vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night; </span>
<span class='v JH4_11' data-id='JH4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh, that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as well as much cattle? </span></div></div>
