<span class='v ML3_1' data-id='ML3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>See, I am sending my servant, and he will make ready the way before me; and the Lord, whom you are looking for, will suddenly come to his Temple; and the angel of the agreement, in whom you have delight, see, he is coming, says the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v ML3_2' data-id='ML3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But by whom may the day of his coming be faced? and who may keep his place when he is seen? for he is like the metal-tester's fire and the cleaner's soap. </span>
<span class='v ML3_3' data-id='ML3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He will take his seat, testing and cleaning the sons of Levi, burning away the evil from them as from gold and silver; so that they may make offerings to the Lord in righteousness. </span>
<span class='v ML3_4' data-id='ML3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord, as in days gone by, and as in past years. </span>
<span class='v ML3_5' data-id='ML3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I will come near to you for judging; I will quickly be a witness against the wonder-workers, against those who have been untrue in married life, against those who take false oaths; against those who keep back from the servant his payment, and who are hard on the widow and the child without a father, who do not give his rights to the man from a strange country, and have no fear of me, says the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v ML3_6' data-id='ML3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I am the Lord, I am unchanged; and so you, O sons of Jacob, have not been cut off. </span>
<span class='v ML3_7' data-id='ML3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>From the days of your fathers you have been turned away from my rules and have not kept them. Come back to me, and I will come back to you, says the Lord of armies. But you say, How are we to come back? </span>
<span class='v ML3_8' data-id='ML3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Will a man keep back from God what is right? But you have kept back what is mine. But you say, What have we kept back from you? Tenths and offerings. </span>
<span class='v ML3_9' data-id='ML3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You are cursed with a curse; for you have kept back from me what is mine, even all this nation. </span>
<span class='v ML3_10' data-id='ML3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let your tenths come into the store-house so that there may be food in my house, and put me to the test by doing so, says the Lord of armies, and see if I do not make the windows of heaven open and send down such a blessing on you that there is no room for it. </span>
<span class='v ML3_11' data-id='ML3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And on your account I will keep back the locusts from wasting the fruits of your land; and the fruit of your vine will not be dropped on the field before its time, says the Lord of armies </span>
<span class='v ML3_12' data-id='ML3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And you will be named happy by all nations: for you will be a land of delight, says the Lord of armies. </span>
<span class='v ML3_13' data-id='ML3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Your words have been strong against me, says the Lord. And still you say, What have we said against you? </span>
<span class='v ML3_14' data-id='ML3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You have said, It is no use worshipping God: what profit have we had from keeping his orders, and going in clothing of sorrow before the Lord of armies? </span>
<span class='v ML3_15' data-id='ML3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And now to us the men of pride seem happy; yes, the evil-doers are doing well; they put God to the test and are safe. </span>
<span class='v ML3_16' data-id='ML3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then those in whom was the fear of the Lord had talk together: and the Lord gave ear, and it was recorded in a book to be kept in mind before him, for those who had the fear of the Lord and gave thought to his name. </span>
<span class='v ML3_17' data-id='ML3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they will be mine, says the Lord, in the day when I make them my special property; and I will have mercy on them as a man has mercy on his son who is his servant. </span>
<span class='v ML3_18' data-id='ML3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then you will again see how the upright man is different from the sinner, and the servant of God from him who is not. </span></div></div>
