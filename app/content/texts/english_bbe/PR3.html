<span class='v PR3_2' data-id='PR3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For they will give you increase of days, years of life, and peace. </span>
<span class='v PR3_3' data-id='PR3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let not mercy and good faith go from you; let them be hanging round your neck, recorded on your heart; </span>
<span class='v PR3_4' data-id='PR3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So you will have grace and a good name in the eyes of God and men. </span>

<span class='v PR3_10' data-id='PR3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine. </span>
<span class='v PR3_11' data-id='PR3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training: </span>
<span class='v PR3_12' data-id='PR3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain. </span>
