<span class='v PR3_11' data-id='PR3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My son, do not make your heart hard against the Lord's teaching; do not be made angry by his training: </span>
<span class='v PR3_12' data-id='PR3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For to those who are dear to him the Lord says sharp words, and makes the son in whom he has delight undergo pain. </span>
