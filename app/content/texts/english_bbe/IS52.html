<span class='v IS52_1' data-id='IS52_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Awake! awake! put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful robes, O Jerusalem, the holy town: for from now there will never again come into you the unclean and those without circumcision. </span>
<span class='v IS52_2' data-id='IS52_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Make yourself clean from the dust; up! and take the seat of your power, O Jerusalem: the bands of your neck are loose, O prisoned daughter of Zion. </span>
<span class='v IS52_3' data-id='IS52_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the Lord says, You were given for nothing, and you will be made free without price. </span>
<span class='v IS52_4' data-id='IS52_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For the Lord God says, My people went down at first into Egypt, to get a place for themselves there: and the Assyrian put a cruel yoke on them without cause. </span>
<span class='v IS52_5' data-id='IS52_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now then, what have I here? says the Lord, for my people are taken away without cause; they are made waste and give cries of sorrow, says the Lord, and all the day the nations put shame on my name. </span>
<span class='v IS52_6' data-id='IS52_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause I will make my name clear to my people; in that day they will be certain that it is my word which comes to them; see, here am I. </span>
<span class='v IS52_7' data-id='IS52_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who comes with good news, who gives word of peace, saying that salvation is near; who says to Zion, Your God is ruling! </span>
<span class='v IS52_8' data-id='IS52_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The voice of your watchmen! their voices are loud in song together; for they will see him, eye to eye, when the Lord comes back to Zion. </span>
<span class='v IS52_9' data-id='IS52_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Give sounds of joy, make melody together, waste places of Jerusalem: for the Lord has given comfort to his people, he has taken up the cause of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v IS52_10' data-id='IS52_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The Lord has let his holy arm be seen by the eyes of all nations; and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our God. </span>
<span class='v IS52_11' data-id='IS52_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Away! away! go out from there, touching no unclean thing; go out from among her; be clean, you who take up the vessels of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS52_12' data-id='IS52_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For you will not go out suddenly, and you will not go in flight: for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel will come after you to keep you. </span>
<span class='v IS52_13' data-id='IS52_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>See, my servant will do well in his undertakings, he will be honoured, and lifted up, and be very high. </span>
<span class='v IS52_14' data-id='IS52_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>As peoples were surprised at him, And his face was not beautiful, so as to be desired: his face was so changed by disease as to be unlike that of a man, and his form was no longer that of the sons of men. </span>
<span class='v IS52_15' data-id='IS52_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So will nations give him honour; kings will keep quiet because of him: for what had not been made clear to them they will see; and they will give their minds to what had not come to their ears. </span></div></div>
