<span class='v P15_1' data-id='P15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I who am myself one of the rulers of the church, and a witness of the death of Christ, having my part in the coming glory, send this serious request to the chief men among you: </span>
<span class='v P15_2' data-id='P15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Keep watch over the flock of God which is in your care, using your authority, not as forced to do so, but gladly; and not for unclean profit but with a ready mind; </span>
<span class='v P15_3' data-id='P15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Not as lords over God's heritage, but making yourselves examples to the flock. </span>
<span class='v P15_4' data-id='P15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And at the coming of the chief Keeper of the sheep, you will be given the eternal crown of glory. </span>
<span class='v P15_5' data-id='P15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And in the same way, let the younger men be ruled by the older ones. Let all of you put away pride and make yourselves ready to be servants: for God is a hater of pride, but he gives grace to those who make themselves low. </span>
<span class='v P15_6' data-id='P15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause make yourselves low under the strong hand of God, so that when the time comes you may be lifted up; </span>
<span class='v P15_7' data-id='P15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Putting all your troubles on him, for he takes care of you. </span>
<span class='v P15_8' data-id='P15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Be serious and keep watch; the Evil One, who is against you, goes about like a lion with open mouth in search of food; </span>
<span class='v P15_9' data-id='P15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not give way to him but be strong in your faith, in the knowledge that your brothers who are in the world undergo the same troubles. </span>
<span class='v P15_10' data-id='P15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And after you have undergone pain for a little time, the God of all grace who has given you a part in his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, will himself give you strength and support, and make you complete in every good thing; </span>
<span class='v P15_11' data-id='P15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>His is the power for ever. So be it. </span>
<span class='v P15_12' data-id='P15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I have sent you this short letter by Silvanus, a true brother, in my opinion; comforting you and witnessing that this is the true grace of God; keep to it. </span>
<span class='v P15_13' data-id='P15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>She who is in Babylon, who has a part with you in the purpose of God, sends you her love; and so does my son Mark. </span>
<span class='v P15_14' data-id='P15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Give one another the kiss of love. Peace be to you all in Christ. </span></div></div>
