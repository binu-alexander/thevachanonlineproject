<span class='v IS23_2' data-id='IS23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Send out a cry of grief, you men of the sea-land, traders of Zidon, who go over the sea, whose representatives are on great waters; </span>

<span class='v IS23_5' data-id='IS23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When the news comes to Egypt they will be bitterly pained at the fate of Tyre. </span>

<span class='v IS23_7' data-id='IS23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Is this the town which was full of joy, whose start goes back to times long past, whose wanderings took her into far-off countries? </span>
<span class='v IS23_8' data-id='IS23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>By whom was this purposed against Tyre, the crowning town, whose traders are chiefs, whose business men are honoured in the land? </span>
<span class='v IS23_9' data-id='IS23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>It was the purpose of the Lord of armies to put pride to shame, to make sport of the glory of those who are honoured in the earth. </span>
<span class='v IS23_10' data-id='IS23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let your land be worked with the plough, O daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer any harbour. </span>
<span class='v IS23_11' data-id='IS23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>His hand is stretched out over the sea, the kingdoms are shaking: the Lord has given orders about Canaan, to make waste its strong places. </span>
<span class='v IS23_12' data-id='IS23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he said, There is no more joy for you, O crushed virgin daughter of Zidon: up! go over to Kittim; even there you will have no rest. </span>

<span class='v IS23_16' data-id='IS23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Take an instrument of music, go about the town, O loose woman who has gone out from the memory of man; make sweet melody with songs, so that you may come back to men's minds. </span>
<span class='v IS23_17' data-id='IS23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And it will be after the end of seventy years, that the Lord will have mercy on Tyre, and she will go back to her trade, acting as a loose woman with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. </span>
