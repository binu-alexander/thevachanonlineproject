<span class='v C213_1' data-id='C213_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>This is the third time that I am coming to you. From the mouth of two or three witnesses will every word be made certain. </span>
<span class='v C213_2' data-id='C213_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I said before, and still say it before I come, as being present for the second time, though I am still away from you, to those who have done wrong before, and to all the others, that if I come again I will not have pity; </span>
<span class='v C213_3' data-id='C213_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Seeing that you are looking for a sign of Christ giving out his word in me; who is not feeble in relation to you, but is strong in you: </span>
<span class='v C213_4' data-id='C213_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For he was feeble in that he was put to death on the cross, but he is living by the power of God. And we are feeble in him, but we will be living with him through the power of God in relation to you. </span>
<span class='v C213_5' data-id='C213_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Make a test of yourselves, if you are in the faith; make certain of yourselves. Or are you not conscious in yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, if you are truly Christ's? </span>
<span class='v C213_6' data-id='C213_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But it is my hope that you will have no doubt that we are truly Christ's. </span>
<span class='v C213_7' data-id='C213_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now our prayer to God is that you may do no evil; not in order that it may be put to our credit, but so that you may do what is right, whatever we may seem. </span>
<span class='v C213_8' data-id='C213_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Because we are able to do nothing against what is true, but only for it. </span>
<span class='v C213_9' data-id='C213_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we are glad when we are feeble and you are strong: and this is our prayer, even that you may be made complete. </span>
<span class='v C213_10' data-id='C213_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this cause I am writing these things while I am away, so that there may be need for me, when I am present, to make use of sharp measures, by the authority which the Lord has given me for building up and not for destruction. </span>
<span class='v C213_11' data-id='C213_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let this be my last word, brothers; be glad; be complete; be comforted; be of the same mind; be at peace with one another: and the God of love and peace will be with you. </span>
<span class='v C213_12' data-id='C213_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Give one another a holy kiss. </span>
<span class='v C213_13' data-id='C213_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>All the saints send their love to you. </span>
<span class='v C213_14' data-id='C213_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the harmony of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. </span></div></div>
