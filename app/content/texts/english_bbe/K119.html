<span class='v K119_1' data-id='K119_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Ahab gave Jezebel news of all Elijah had done, and how he had put all the prophets to death with the sword. </span>
<span class='v K119_2' data-id='K119_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Jezebel sent a servant to Elijah, saying, May the gods' punishment be on me if I do not make your life like the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time. </span>
<span class='v K119_3' data-id='K119_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he got up, fearing for his life, and went in flight, and came to Beer-sheba in Judah, parting there from his servant; </span>
<span class='v K119_4' data-id='K119_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>While he himself went a day's journey into the waste land, and took a seat under a broom-plant, desiring for himself only death; for he said, It is enough: now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers. </span>
<span class='v K119_5' data-id='K119_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And stretching himself on the earth, he went to sleep under the broom-plant; but an angel, touching him, said to him, Get up and have some food. </span>
<span class='v K119_6' data-id='K119_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And looking up, he saw by his head a cake cooked on the stones and a bottle of water. So he took food and drink and went to sleep again. </span>
<span class='v K119_7' data-id='K119_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the Lord came again a second time, and touching him said, Get up and have some food, or the journey will be overmuch for your strength. </span>
<span class='v K119_8' data-id='K119_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So he got up and took food and drink, and in the strength of that food he went on for forty days and nights, to Horeb, the mountain of God. </span>
<span class='v K119_9' data-id='K119_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And there he went into a hole in the rock for the night; then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, What are you doing here, Elijah? </span>
<span class='v K119_10' data-id='K119_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have made destruction of your altars, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life. </span>
<span class='v K119_11' data-id='K119_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then he said, Go out and take your place on the mountain before the Lord. Then the Lord went by, and mountains were parted by the force of a great wind, and rocks were broken before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earth-shock, but the Lord was not in the earth-shock. </span>
<span class='v K119_12' data-id='K119_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And after the earth-shock a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, the sound of a soft breath. </span>
<span class='v K119_13' data-id='K119_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Elijah, hearing it, went out, covering his face with his robe, and took his place in the opening of the hole. And there a voice came to him saying, What are you doing here, Elijah? </span>
<span class='v K119_14' data-id='K119_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he said, I have been burning for the honour of the Lord, the God of armies; for the children of Israel have not kept your agreement; they have had your altars broken down, and have put your prophets to death with the sword: till I, even I, am the only one living; and now they are attempting to take away my life. </span>
<span class='v K119_15' data-id='K119_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to him, Go back on your way through the waste land to Damascus; and when you come there, put the holy oil on Hazael to make him king over Aram; </span>
<span class='v K119_16' data-id='K119_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And on Jehu, son of Nimshi, making him king over Israel; and on Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah, to be prophet in your place. </span>
<span class='v K119_17' data-id='K119_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And it will come about that the man who gets away safe from the sword of Hazael, Jehu will put to death; and whoever gets away safe from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will put to death. </span>
<span class='v K119_18' data-id='K119_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But I will keep safe seven thousand in Israel, all those whose knees have not been bent to Baal, and whose mouths have given him no kisses. </span>
<span class='v K119_19' data-id='K119_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So he went away from there and came across Elisha, the son of Shaphat, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen, he himself walking with the twelfth; and Elijah went up to him and put his robe on him. </span>
<span class='v K119_20' data-id='K119_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And letting the oxen be where they were, he came running after Elijah, and said, Only let me give a kiss to my father and mother, and then I will come after you. But he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to you? </span>
<span class='v K119_21' data-id='K119_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he went back, and took the oxen and put them to death, and cooking their flesh with the yokes of the oxen, he gave the people a feast. Then he got up and went after Elijah and became his servant. </span></div></div>
