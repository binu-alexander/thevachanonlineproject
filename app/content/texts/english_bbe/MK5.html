<span class='v MK5_1' data-id='MK5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And they came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gerasenes. </span>
<span class='v MK5_2' data-id='MK5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And when he had got out of the boat, straight away there came to him from the place of the dead a man with an unclean spirit. </span>
<span class='v MK5_3' data-id='MK5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He was living in the place of the dead: and no man was able to keep him down, no, not with a chain; </span>
<span class='v MK5_4' data-id='MK5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because he had frequently been prisoned in chains and iron bands, and the chains had been parted and the bands broken by him: and no man was strong enough to make him quiet. </span>
<span class='v MK5_5' data-id='MK5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And all the time, by day and by night, in the place of the dead, and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones. </span>
<span class='v MK5_6' data-id='MK5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when he saw Jesus from far off, he went quickly to him and gave him worship; </span>
<span class='v MK5_7' data-id='MK5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And crying out with a loud voice he said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God's name, do not be cruel to me. </span>
<span class='v MK5_8' data-id='MK5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit. </span>
<span class='v MK5_9' data-id='MK5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, What is your name? And he made answer, My name is Legion, because there are a great number of us. </span>
<span class='v MK5_10' data-id='MK5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he made strong prayers to him not to send them away out of the country. </span>
<span class='v MK5_11' data-id='MK5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now on the mountain side there was a great herd of pigs getting their food. </span>
<span class='v MK5_12' data-id='MK5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Send us into the pigs, so that we may go into them. </span>
<span class='v MK5_13' data-id='MK5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he let them do it. And the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs; and the herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea, about two thousand of them; and they came to their death in the sea. </span>
<span class='v MK5_14' data-id='MK5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And their keepers went running and gave an account of it in the town and in the country. And people came to see what had taken place. </span>
<span class='v MK5_15' data-id='MK5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they came to Jesus, and saw the man in whom had been the evil spirits seated, clothed and with full use of his senses, and they were full of fear. </span>
<span class='v MK5_16' data-id='MK5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And those who had seen it gave them an account of what had been done to him who had the evil spirits, and of the fate of the pigs. </span>
<span class='v MK5_17' data-id='MK5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they made a request to him to go out of their country. </span>
<span class='v MK5_18' data-id='MK5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when he was getting into the boat, the man in whom had been the evil spirits had a great desire to come with him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_19' data-id='MK5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he would not let him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your friends, and give them news of the great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you. </span>
<span class='v MK5_20' data-id='MK5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he went on his way, and made public in the country of Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him: and all men were full of wonder. </span>
<span class='v MK5_21' data-id='MK5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had gone over again in the boat to the other side, a great number of people came to him: and he was by the sea. </span>
<span class='v MK5_22' data-id='MK5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And one of the rulers of the Synagogue, Jairus by name, came, and seeing him, went down at his feet, </span>
<span class='v MK5_23' data-id='MK5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And made strong prayers to him, saying, My little daughter is near to death: it is my prayer that you will come and put your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and have life. </span>
<span class='v MK5_24' data-id='MK5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And he went with him; and a great number of people went after him, and came round him. </span>
<span class='v MK5_25' data-id='MK5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And a woman, who had had a flow of blood for twelve years, </span>
<span class='v MK5_26' data-id='MK5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And had undergone much at the hands of a number of medical men, and had given all she had, and was no better, but even worse, </span>
<span class='v MK5_27' data-id='MK5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When she had news of the things which Jesus did, went among the people coming after him, and put her hand on his robe. </span>
<span class='v MK5_28' data-id='MK5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For she said, If I may only put my hand on his robe, I will be made well. </span>
<span class='v MK5_29' data-id='MK5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And straight away the fountain of her blood was stopped, and she had a feeling in her body that her disease had gone and she was well. </span>
<span class='v MK5_30' data-id='MK5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And straight away Jesus was conscious that power had gone out of him; and, turning to the people, he said, Who was touching my robe? </span>
<span class='v MK5_31' data-id='MK5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And his disciples said to him, You see the people round you on every side, and you say, Who was touching me? </span>
<span class='v MK5_32' data-id='MK5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And on his looking round to see her who had done this thing, </span>
<span class='v MK5_33' data-id='MK5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The woman, shaking with fear, conscious of what had been done to her, came and, falling on her face before him, gave him a true account of everything. </span>
<span class='v MK5_34' data-id='MK5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be free from your disease. </span>
<span class='v MK5_35' data-id='MK5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And while he was still talking, they came from the ruler of the Synagogue's house, saying, Your daughter is dead: why are you still troubling the Master? </span>
<span class='v MK5_36' data-id='MK5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, giving no attention to their words, said to the ruler of the Synagogue, Have no fear, only have faith. </span>
<span class='v MK5_37' data-id='MK5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And he did not let anyone come with him, but Peter and James and John, the brother of James. </span>
<span class='v MK5_38' data-id='MK5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And they came to the house of the ruler of the Synagogue; and he saw people running this way and that, and weeping and crying loudly. </span>
<span class='v MK5_39' data-id='MK5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when he had gone in, he said to them, Why are you making such a noise and weeping? The child is not dead, but sleeping. </span>
<span class='v MK5_40' data-id='MK5_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And they were laughing at him. But he, having sent them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was. </span>
<span class='v MK5_41' data-id='MK5_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And taking her by the hand, he said to her, Talitha cumi, which is, My child, I say to you, Get up. </span>
<span class='v MK5_42' data-id='MK5_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And the young girl got up straight away, and was walking about; she being twelve years old. And they were overcome with wonder. </span>
<span class='v MK5_43' data-id='MK5_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And he gave them special orders that they were not to say anything of this; and he said that some food was to be given to her. </span></div></div>
