<span class='v AC2_1' data-id='AC2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And when the day of Pentecost was come, they were all together in one place. </span>
<span class='v AC2_2' data-id='AC2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rushing of a violent wind, and all the house where they were was full of it. </span>
<span class='v AC2_3' data-id='AC2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they saw tongues, like flames of fire, coming to rest on every one of them. </span>
<span class='v AC2_4' data-id='AC2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they were all full of the Holy Spirit, and were talking in different languages, as the Spirit gave them power. </span>
<span class='v AC2_5' data-id='AC2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now there were living at Jerusalem, Jews, God-fearing men, from every nation under heaven. </span>
<span class='v AC2_6' data-id='AC2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when this sound came to their ears, they all came together, and were greatly surprised because every man was hearing the words of the disciples in his special language. </span>
<span class='v AC2_7' data-id='AC2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they were full of wonder and said, Are not all these men Galilaeans? </span>
<span class='v AC2_8' data-id='AC2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And how is it that every one of us is hearing their words in the language which was ours from our birth? </span>
<span class='v AC2_9' data-id='AC2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Men of Parthia, Media, and Elam, and those living in Mesopotamia, in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, </span>
<span class='v AC2_10' data-id='AC2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and those who have come from Rome, Jews by birth and others who have become Jews, </span>
<span class='v AC2_11' data-id='AC2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Men of Crete and Arabia, to all of us they are talking in our different languages, of the great works of God. </span>
<span class='v AC2_12' data-id='AC2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they were all surprised and in doubt saying to one another, What is the reason of this? </span>
<span class='v AC2_13' data-id='AC2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But others, making sport of them, said, They are full of new wine. </span>
<span class='v AC2_14' data-id='AC2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Peter, getting up, with the eleven, said in a loud voice, O men of Judaea, and all you who are living in Jerusalem, take note of this and give ear to my words. </span>
<span class='v AC2_15' data-id='AC2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For these men are not overcome with wine, as it seems to you, for it is only the third hour of the day; </span>
<span class='v AC2_16' data-id='AC2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But this is the thing which was said by the prophet Joel; </span>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And it will come about, in the last days, says God, that I will send out my Spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will have dreams: </span>
<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And on my men-servants and my women-servants I will send my Spirit, and they will be prophets. </span>
<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And wonders will be seen in heaven, and signs on the earth, blood and fire and smoke: </span>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The sun will become dark and the moon will be turned to blood, before that great day of the Lord comes in glory: </span>
<span class='v AC2_21' data-id='AC2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And whoever makes his prayer to the Lord will have salvation. </span>
<span class='v AC2_22' data-id='AC2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Men of Israel, give ear to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man who had the approval of God, as was made clear to you by the great works and signs and wonders which God did by him among you, as you yourselves have knowledge, </span>
<span class='v AC2_23' data-id='AC2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Him, when he was given up, by the decision and knowledge of God, you put to death on the cross, by the hands of evil men: </span>
<span class='v AC2_24' data-id='AC2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But God gave him back to life, having made him free from the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be overcome by it. </span>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For David said of him, I saw the Lord before my face at all times, for he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved: </span>
<span class='v AC2_26' data-id='AC2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And for this cause my heart was glad and my tongue full of joy, and my flesh will be resting in hope: </span>
<span class='v AC2_27' data-id='AC2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For you will not let my soul be in hell and you will not give up your Holy One to destruction. </span>
<span class='v AC2_28' data-id='AC2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You have made me see the ways of life; I will be full of joy when I see your face. </span>
<span class='v AC2_29' data-id='AC2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>My brothers, I may say to you openly that David came to his death, and was put in the earth, and his resting-place is with us today. </span>
<span class='v AC2_30' data-id='AC2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But being a prophet, and having in mind the oath which God had given to him, that of the fruit of his body one would take his place as a king, </span>
<span class='v AC2_31' data-id='AC2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He, having knowledge of the future, was talking of the coming again of Christ from the dead, that he was not kept in hell and his body did not see destruction. </span>
<span class='v AC2_32' data-id='AC2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This Jesus God has given back to life, of which we all are witnesses. </span>
<span class='v AC2_33' data-id='AC2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And so, being lifted up to the right hand of God, and having the Father's word that the Holy Spirit would come, he has sent this thing, which now you see and have knowledge of. </span>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For David has not gone up into heaven, but says, himself, The Lord said to my Lord, Be seated at my right hand, </span>
<span class='v AC2_35' data-id='AC2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Till I put all those who are against you under your feet. </span>
<span class='v AC2_36' data-id='AC2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>For this reason, let all Israel be certain that this Jesus, whom you put to death on the cross, God has made Lord and Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC2_37' data-id='AC2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now when these words came to their ears their hearts were troubled, and they said to Peter and the other Apostles, Brothers, what are we to do? </span>
<span class='v AC2_38' data-id='AC2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And Peter said, Let your hearts be changed, every one of you, and have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will have the Holy Spirit given to you. </span>
<span class='v AC2_39' data-id='AC2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>For the word of God is for you and for your children and for all those who are far off, even all those who may be marked out by the Lord our God. </span>
<span class='v AC2_40' data-id='AC2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And with more such words he gave his witness, offering them salvation and saying, Come out from this evil generation. </span>
<span class='v AC2_41' data-id='AC2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then those who gave hearing to his words had baptism: and about three thousand souls were joined to them that day. </span>
<span class='v AC2_42' data-id='AC2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And they kept their attention fixed on the Apostles' teaching and were united together in the taking of broken bread and in prayer. </span>
<span class='v AC2_43' data-id='AC2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>But fear came on every soul: and all sorts of wonders and signs were done by the Apostles. </span>
<span class='v AC2_44' data-id='AC2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And all those who were of the faith kept together, and had all things in common; </span>
<span class='v AC2_45' data-id='AC2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And exchanging their goods and property for money, they made division of it among them all, as they had need. </span>
<span class='v AC2_46' data-id='AC2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And day by day, going in agreement together regularly to the Temple and, taking broken bread together in their houses, they took their food with joy and with true hearts, </span>
<span class='v AC2_47' data-id='AC2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Giving praise to God, and having the approval of all the people; and every day the number of those who had salvation was increased by the Lord. </span></div></div>
