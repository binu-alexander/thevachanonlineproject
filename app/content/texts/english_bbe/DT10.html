<span class='v DT10_1' data-id='DT10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time the Lord said to me, Make two other stones, cut like the first two, and come up to me on the mountain, and make an ark of wood. </span>
<span class='v DT10_2' data-id='DT10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I will put on the stones the words which were on the first stones which were broken by you, and you are to put them into the ark. </span>
<span class='v DT10_3' data-id='DT10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I made an ark of hard wood, and had two stones cut like the others, and went up the mountain with the stones in my hands. </span>
<span class='v DT10_4' data-id='DT10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he put on the stones, as in the first writing, the ten rules which the Lord gave you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the great meeting: and the Lord gave the stones to me. </span>
<span class='v DT10_5' data-id='DT10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And turning round I came down from the mountain and put the stones in the ark which I had made; and there they are as the Lord gave me orders. </span>
<span class='v DT10_6' data-id='DT10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>(And the children of Israel went on from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah: there death came to Aaron and he was put to rest in the earth; and Eleazar, his son, took his place as priest. </span>
<span class='v DT10_7' data-id='DT10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>From there they went on to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of streams of water. </span>
<span class='v DT10_8' data-id='DT10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>At that time the Lord had the tribe of Levi marked out to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement, to be before the Lord and to do his work and to give blessings in his name, to this day. </span>
<span class='v DT10_9' data-id='DT10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this reason Levi has no part or heritage for himself among his brothers: the Lord is his heritage, as the Lord your God said to him.) </span>
<span class='v DT10_10' data-id='DT10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I was in the mountain, as at the first time, for forty days and forty nights; and again the ears of the Lord were open to my prayer, and he did not send destruction on you. </span>
<span class='v DT10_11' data-id='DT10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord said to me, Get up and go on your journey before the people, so that they may go in and take the land which I said in my oath to their fathers that I would give them. </span>
<span class='v DT10_12' data-id='DT10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And now, Israel, what would the Lord your God have you do, but to go in the fear of the Lord your God, walking in all his ways and loving him and doing his pleasure with all your heart and all your soul, </span>
<span class='v DT10_13' data-id='DT10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Doing the orders of the Lord and keeping his laws which I give you this day for your good? </span>
<span class='v DT10_14' data-id='DT10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Lord your God is ruler of heaven, of the heaven of heavens, and of the earth with everything in it. </span>
<span class='v DT10_15' data-id='DT10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But the Lord had delight in your fathers and love for them, marking out for himself their seed after them, even you, from all peoples, as at this day. </span>
<span class='v DT10_16' data-id='DT10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let your circumcision be of the heart, and put away your pride. </span>
<span class='v DT10_17' data-id='DT10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, strong in power and greatly to be feared, who has no respect for any man's position and takes no rewards: </span>
<span class='v DT10_18' data-id='DT10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Judging uprightly in the cause of the widow and of the child who has no father, and giving food and clothing in his mercy to the man from a strange country. </span>
<span class='v DT10_19' data-id='DT10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So be kind to the man from a strange country who is living among you, for you yourselves were living in a strange country in the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v DT10_20' data-id='DT10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Let the fear of the Lord your God be before you, give him worship and be true to him at all times, taking your oaths in his name. </span>
<span class='v DT10_21' data-id='DT10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He is your God, the God of your praise, your God who has done for you all these works of power which your eyes have seen. </span>
<span class='v DT10_22' data-id='DT10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now the Lord your God has made you like the stars of heaven in number. </span></div></div>
