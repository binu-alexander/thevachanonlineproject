<span class='v GL2_1' data-id='GL2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me. </span>
<span class='v GL2_2' data-id='GL2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect. </span>
<span class='v GL2_3' data-id='GL2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision: </span>
<span class='v GL2_4' data-id='GL2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us; </span>
<span class='v GL2_5' data-id='GL2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you. </span>
<span class='v GL2_6' data-id='GL2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man's person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me; </span>
<span class='v GL2_7' data-id='GL2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision </span>
<span class='v GL2_8' data-id='GL2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>(Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles); </span>
<span class='v GL2_9' data-id='GL2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision; </span>
<span class='v GL2_10' data-id='GL2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do. </span>
<span class='v GL2_11' data-id='GL2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. </span>
<span class='v GL2_12' data-id='GL2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision. </span>
<span class='v GL2_13' data-id='GL2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways. </span>
<span class='v GL2_14' data-id='GL2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews? </span>
<span class='v GL2_15' data-id='GL2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles, </span>
<span class='v GL2_16' data-id='GL2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness. </span>
<span class='v GL2_17' data-id='GL2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way! </span>
<span class='v GL2_18' data-id='GL2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer. </span>
<span class='v GL2_19' data-id='GL2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God. </span>
<span class='v GL2_20' data-id='GL2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me. </span>
<span class='v GL2_21' data-id='GL2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing. </span></div></div>
