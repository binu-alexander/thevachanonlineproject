<span class='v IS44_1' data-id='IS44_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And now, give ear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have taken for myself: </span>
<span class='v IS44_2' data-id='IS44_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Lord who made you, forming you in your mother's body, the Lord, your helper, says, Have no fear, O Jacob my servant, and you, Jeshurun, whom I have taken for myself. </span>
<span class='v IS44_3' data-id='IS44_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I will send water on the land needing it, and streams on the dry earth: I will let my spirit come down on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring. </span>
<span class='v IS44_4' data-id='IS44_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they will come up like grass in a well-watered field, like water-plants by the streams. </span>
<span class='v IS44_5' data-id='IS44_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>One will say, I am the Lord's; and another will give himself the name, Jacob; another will put a mark on his hand, I am the Lord's, and another will take the name of Israel for himself. </span>
<span class='v IS44_6' data-id='IS44_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The Lord, the King of Israel, even the Lord of armies who has taken up his cause, says, I am the first and the last, and there is no God but me. </span>
<span class='v IS44_7' data-id='IS44_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If there is one like me, let him come forward and say it, let him make it clear and put it in order before me: who has made clear in the past the things to come? let him make clear the future to me. </span>
<span class='v IS44_8' data-id='IS44_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Have no fear, be strong in heart; have I not made it clear to you in the past, and let you see it? and you are my witnesses. Is there any God but me, or a Rock of whom I have no knowledge? </span>
<span class='v IS44_9' data-id='IS44_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Those who make a pictured image are all of them as nothing, and the things of their desire will be of no profit to them: and their servants see not, and have no knowledge; so they will be put to shame. </span>
<span class='v IS44_10' data-id='IS44_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whoever makes a god, makes nothing but a metal image in which there is no profit. </span>
<span class='v IS44_11' data-id='IS44_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Truly, all those who make use of secret arts will be put to shame, and their words of power are only words of men: let them all come forward together; they will all be in fear and be put to shame. </span>
<span class='v IS44_12' data-id='IS44_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The iron-worker is heating the metal in the fire, giving it form with his hammers, and working on it with his strong arm: then for need of food his strength gives way, and for need of water he becomes feeble. </span>
<span class='v IS44_13' data-id='IS44_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The woodworker is measuring out the wood with his line, marking it out with his pencil: after smoothing it with his plane, and making circles on it with his instrument, he gives it the form and glory of a man, so that it may be placed in the house. </span>
<span class='v IS44_14' data-id='IS44_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He has cedars cut down for himself, he takes an oak and lets it get strong among the trees of the wood; he has an ash-tree planted, and the rain gives it growth. </span>
<span class='v IS44_15' data-id='IS44_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then it will be used to make a fire, so that a man may get warm; he has the oven heated with it and makes bread: he makes a god with it, to which he gives worship: he makes a pictured image out of it, and goes down on his face before it. </span>
<span class='v IS44_16' data-id='IS44_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>With part of it he makes a fire, and on the fire he gets meat cooked and takes a full meal: he makes himself warm, and says, Aha! I am warm, I have seen the fire: </span>
<span class='v IS44_17' data-id='IS44_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the rest of it he makes into a god, even his pictured image: he goes down on his face before it, giving worship to it, and making prayer to it, saying, Be my saviour; for you are my god. </span>
<span class='v IS44_18' data-id='IS44_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They have no knowledge or wisdom; for he has put a veil over their eyes, so that they may not see; and on their hearts, so that they may not give attention. </span>
<span class='v IS44_19' data-id='IS44_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And no one takes note, no one has enough knowledge or wisdom to say, I have put part of it in the fire, and made bread on it; I have had a meal of the flesh cooked with it: and am I now to make the rest of it into a false god? am I to go down on my face before a bit of wood? </span>
<span class='v IS44_20' data-id='IS44_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As for him whose food is the dust of a dead fire, he has been turned from the way by a twisted mind, so that he is unable to keep himself safe by saying, What I have here in my hand is false. </span>
<span class='v IS44_21' data-id='IS44_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Keep these things in mind, O Jacob; and you Israel, for you are my servant: I have made you; you are my servant; O Israel, I will not let you go out of my memory. </span>
<span class='v IS44_22' data-id='IS44_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>I have put your evil doings out of my mind like a thick cloud, and your sins like a mist: come back to me; for I have taken up your cause. </span>
<span class='v IS44_23' data-id='IS44_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Make a song, O heavens, for the Lord has done it: give a loud cry, you deep parts of the earth: let your voices be loud in song, you mountains, and you woods with all your trees: for the Lord has taken up the cause of Jacob, and will let his glory be seen in Israel. </span>
<span class='v IS44_24' data-id='IS44_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The Lord, who has taken up your cause, and who gave you life in your mother's body, says, I am the Lord who makes all things; stretching out the heavens by myself, and giving the earth its limits; who was with me? </span>
<span class='v IS44_25' data-id='IS44_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Who makes the signs of those who give word of the future come to nothing, so that those who have knowledge of secret arts go off their heads; turning the wise men back, and making their knowledge foolish: </span>
<span class='v IS44_26' data-id='IS44_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Who makes the word of his servants certain, and gives effect to the purposes of his representatives; who says of Jerusalem, Her people will come back to her; and of the towns of Judah, I will give orders for their building, and will make her waste places fertile again: </span>
<span class='v IS44_27' data-id='IS44_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Who says to the deep, Be dry, and I will make your rivers dry: </span>
<span class='v IS44_28' data-id='IS44_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Who says of Cyrus, He will take care of my sheep, and will do all my pleasure: who says of Jerusalem, I will give the word for your building; and of the Temple, Your bases will be put in place. </span></div></div>
