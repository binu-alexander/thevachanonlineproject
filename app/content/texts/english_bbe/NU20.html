<span class='v NU20_1' data-id='NU20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the first month all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Zin, and put up their tents in Kadesh; there death came to Miriam, and they put her body to rest in the earth. </span>
<span class='v NU20_2' data-id='NU20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And there was no water for the people: and they came together against Moses and against Aaron. </span>
<span class='v NU20_3' data-id='NU20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the people were angry with Moses and said, If only death had overtaken us when our brothers came to their death before the Lord! </span>
<span class='v NU20_4' data-id='NU20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Why have you taken the Lord's people into this waste, for death to come to us and to our cattle there? </span>
<span class='v NU20_5' data-id='NU20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Why have you made us come out of Egypt into this evil place? This is no place of seed or figs or vines or other fruits, and there is no water for drinking. </span>
<span class='v NU20_6' data-id='NU20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron went away from the people to the door of the Tent of meeting; and, falling on their faces there, they saw the glory of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v NU20_7' data-id='NU20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU20_8' data-id='NU20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Take the rod, you and Aaron, your brother, and make all the people come together, and before their eyes give orders to the rock to give out its water; and so make water come out of the rock for them, and give the people and their cattle drink. </span>
<span class='v NU20_9' data-id='NU20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he gave him orders. </span>
<span class='v NU20_10' data-id='NU20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Aaron made the people come together in front of the rock, and he said to them, Give ear now, you people whose hearts are turned from the Lord; are we to get water for you out of the rock? </span>
<span class='v NU20_11' data-id='NU20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And lifting up his hand, Moses gave the rock two blows with his rod: and water came streaming out, and the people and their cattle had drink enough. </span>
<span class='v NU20_12' data-id='NU20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you had not enough faith in me to keep my name holy before the children of Israel, you will not take this people into the land which I have given them. </span>
<span class='v NU20_13' data-id='NU20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel went against the Lord, and they saw that he was holy among them. </span>
<span class='v NU20_14' data-id='NU20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Moses sent men from Kadesh to the king of Edom to say to him, Your brother Israel says, You have knowledge of all the things we have been through; </span>
<span class='v NU20_15' data-id='NU20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we were living in Egypt for a long time; and the Egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers: </span>
<span class='v NU20_16' data-id='NU20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the Lord gave ear to the voice of our cry, and sent an angel and took us out of Egypt: and now we are in Kadesh, a town on the edge of your land; </span>
<span class='v NU20_17' data-id='NU20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let us now go through your land: we will not go into field or vine-garden, or take the water of the springs; we will go by the highway, not turning to the right or to the left, till we have gone past the limits of your land. </span>
<span class='v NU20_18' data-id='NU20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Edom said, You are not to go through my land, for if you do I will come out against you with the sword. </span>
<span class='v NU20_19' data-id='NU20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway: and if we or our cattle take of your water, we will give you a price for it: only let us go through on our feet, nothing more. </span>
<span class='v NU20_20' data-id='NU20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But he said, You are not to go through. And Edom came out against them in his strength, with a great army. </span>
<span class='v NU20_21' data-id='NU20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So Edom would not let Israel go through his land; and Israel went in another direction. </span>
<span class='v NU20_22' data-id='NU20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they went on from Kadesh, and came, with all their people, to Mount Hor. </span>
<span class='v NU20_23' data-id='NU20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, </span>
<span class='v NU20_24' data-id='NU20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Aaron will be put to rest with his people; he will not go into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you went against my word at the waters of Meribah. </span>
<span class='v NU20_25' data-id='NU20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So take Aaron and Eleazar, his son, up into Mount Hor; </span>
<span class='v NU20_26' data-id='NU20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And take Aaron's robes off him and put them on Eleazar, his son: and death will come to Aaron there, and he will be put to rest with his people. </span>
<span class='v NU20_27' data-id='NU20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So Moses did as the Lord had said, and before the eyes of all the people they went up Mount Hor. </span>
<span class='v NU20_28' data-id='NU20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Moses took off Aaron's robes, and put them on Eleazar, his son; and there on the top of the mountain death came to Aaron: then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. </span>
<span class='v NU20_29' data-id='NU20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And when the people saw that Aaron was dead, all the children of Israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days. </span></div></div>
