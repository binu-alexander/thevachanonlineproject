<span class='v GN32_1' data-id='GN32_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And on his way Jacob came face to face with the angels of God. </span>
<span class='v GN32_2' data-id='GN32_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And when he saw them he said, This is the army of God: so he gave that place the name of Mahanaim. </span>
<span class='v GN32_3' data-id='GN32_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Jacob sent servants before him to Esau, his brother, in the land of Seir, the country of Edom; </span>
<span class='v GN32_4' data-id='GN32_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he gave them orders to say these words to Esau: Your servant Jacob says, Till now I have been living with Laban: </span>
<span class='v GN32_5' data-id='GN32_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I have oxen and asses and flocks and men-servants and women-servants: and I have sent to give my lord news of these things so that I may have grace in his eyes. </span>
<span class='v GN32_6' data-id='GN32_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When the servants came back they said, We have seen your brother Esau and he is coming out to you, and four hundred men with him. </span>
<span class='v GN32_7' data-id='GN32_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob was in great fear and trouble of mind: and he put all the people and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups; </span>
<span class='v GN32_8' data-id='GN32_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And said, If Esau, meeting one group, makes an attack on them, the others will get away safely. </span>
<span class='v GN32_9' data-id='GN32_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, the God of my father Isaac, the Lord who said to me, Go back to your country and your family and I will be good to you: </span>
<span class='v GN32_10' data-id='GN32_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am less than nothing in comparison with all your mercies and your faith to me your servant; for with only my stick in my hand I went across Jordan, and now I have become two armies. </span>
<span class='v GN32_11' data-id='GN32_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Be my saviour from the hand of Esau, my brother: for my fear is that he will make an attack on me, putting to death mother and child. </span>
<span class='v GN32_12' data-id='GN32_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And you said, Truly, I will be good to you, and make your seed like the sand of the sea which may not be numbered. </span>
<span class='v GN32_13' data-id='GN32_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he put up his tent there for the night; and from among his goods he took, as an offering for his brother Esau, </span>
<span class='v GN32_14' data-id='GN32_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred females and twenty males from the sheep, </span>
<span class='v GN32_15' data-id='GN32_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Thirty camels with their young ones, forty cows, ten oxen, twenty asses, and ten young asses. </span>
<span class='v GN32_16' data-id='GN32_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These he gave to his servants, every herd by itself, and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and let there be a space between one herd and another. </span>
<span class='v GN32_17' data-id='GN32_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he gave orders to the first, saying, When my brother Esau comes to you and says, Whose servant are you, and where are you going, and whose are these herds? </span>
<span class='v GN32_18' data-id='GN32_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then say to him, These are your servant Jacob's; they are an offering for my lord, for Esau; and he himself is coming after us. </span>
<span class='v GN32_19' data-id='GN32_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he gave the same orders to the second and the third and to all those who were with the herds, saying, This is what you are to say to Esau when you see him; </span>
<span class='v GN32_20' data-id='GN32_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And you are to say further, Jacob, your servant, is coming after us. For he said to himself, I will take away his wrath by the offering which I have sent on, and then I will come before him: it may be that I will have grace in his eyes. </span>
<span class='v GN32_21' data-id='GN32_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So the servants with the offerings went on in front, and he himself took his rest that night in the tents with his people. </span>
<span class='v GN32_22' data-id='GN32_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And in the night he got up, and taking with him his two wives and the two servant-women and his eleven children, he went over the river Jabbok. </span>
<span class='v GN32_23' data-id='GN32_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He took them and sent them over the stream with all he had. </span>
<span class='v GN32_24' data-id='GN32_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob was by himself; and a man was fighting with him till dawn. </span>
<span class='v GN32_25' data-id='GN32_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But when the man saw that he was not able to overcome Jacob, he gave him a blow in the hollow part of his leg, so that his leg was damaged. </span>
<span class='v GN32_26' data-id='GN32_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Let me go now, for the dawn is near. But Jacob said, I will not let you go till you have given me your blessing. </span>
<span class='v GN32_27' data-id='GN32_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he said, What is your name? And he said, Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN32_28' data-id='GN32_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he said, Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel: for in your fight with God and with men you have overcome. </span>
<span class='v GN32_29' data-id='GN32_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob said, What is your name? And he said, What is my name to you? Then he gave him a blessing. </span>
<span class='v GN32_30' data-id='GN32_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Jacob gave that place the name of Peniel, saying, I have seen God face to face, and still I am living. </span>
<span class='v GN32_31' data-id='GN32_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And while he was going past Peniel, the sun came up. And he went with unequal steps because of his damaged leg. </span>
<span class='v GN32_32' data-id='GN32_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For this reason the children of Israel, even today, never take that muscle in the hollow of the leg as food, because the hollow of Jacob's leg was touched. </span></div></div>
