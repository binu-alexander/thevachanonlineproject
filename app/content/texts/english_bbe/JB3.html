<span class='v JB3_1' data-id='JB3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then, opening his mouth, and cursing the day of his birth, </span>
<span class='v JB3_2' data-id='JB3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB3_3' data-id='JB3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let destruction take the day of my birth, and the night on which it was said, A man child has come into the world. </span>
<span class='v JB3_4' data-id='JB3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>That day — let it be dark; let not God take note of it from on high, and let not the light be shining on it; </span>
<span class='v JB3_5' data-id='JB3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let the dark and the black night take it for themselves; let it be covered with a cloud; let the dark shades of day send fear on it. </span>
<span class='v JB3_6' data-id='JB3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That night — let the thick dark take it; let it not have joy among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. </span>
<span class='v JB3_7' data-id='JB3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for that night, let it have no fruit; let no voice of joy be sounded in it; </span>
<span class='v JB3_8' data-id='JB3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let it be cursed by those who put a curse on the day; who are ready to make Leviathan awake. </span>
<span class='v JB3_9' data-id='JB3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let its morning stars be dark; let it be looking for light, but may it not have any; let it not see the eyes of the dawn. </span>
<span class='v JB3_10' data-id='JB3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Because it did not keep the doors of my mother's body shut, so that trouble might be veiled from my eyes. </span>
<span class='v JB3_11' data-id='JB3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Why did death not take me when I came out of my mother's body, why did I not, when I came out, give up my last breath? </span>
<span class='v JB3_12' data-id='JB3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Why did the knees take me, or why the breasts that they might give me milk? </span>
<span class='v JB3_13' data-id='JB3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For then I might have gone to my rest in quiet, and in sleep have been in peace, </span>
<span class='v JB3_14' data-id='JB3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>With kings and the wise ones of the earth, who put up great houses for themselves; </span>
<span class='v JB3_15' data-id='JB3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Or with rulers who had gold, and whose houses were full of silver; </span>
<span class='v JB3_16' data-id='JB3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Or as a child dead at birth I might never have come into existence; like young children who have not seen the light. </span>
<span class='v JB3_17' data-id='JB3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>There the passions of the evil are over, and those whose strength has come to an end have rest. </span>
<span class='v JB3_18' data-id='JB3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There the prisoners are at peace together; the voice of the overseer comes not again to their ears. </span>
<span class='v JB3_19' data-id='JB3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. </span>
<span class='v JB3_20' data-id='JB3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Why does he give light to him who is in trouble, and life to the bitter in soul; </span>
<span class='v JB3_21' data-id='JB3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To those whose desire is for death, but it comes not; who are searching for it more than for secret wealth; </span>
<span class='v JB3_22' data-id='JB3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Who are glad with great joy, and full of delight when they come to their last resting-place; </span>
<span class='v JB3_23' data-id='JB3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>To a man whose way is veiled, and who is shut in by God? </span>
<span class='v JB3_24' data-id='JB3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>In place of my food I have grief, and cries of sorrow come from me like water. </span>
<span class='v JB3_25' data-id='JB3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For I have a fear and it comes on me, and my heart is greatly troubled. </span>
<span class='v JB3_26' data-id='JB3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I have no peace, no quiet, and no rest; nothing but pain comes on me. </span></div></div>
