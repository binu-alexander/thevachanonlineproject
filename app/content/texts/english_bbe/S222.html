<span class='v S222_1' data-id='S222_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And David made a song to the Lord in these words, on the day when the Lord made him free from the hands of all his haters, and from the hand of Saul: </span>
<span class='v S222_2' data-id='S222_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said, The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour, even mine; </span>
<span class='v S222_3' data-id='S222_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>My God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my safe place; my saviour, who keeps me safe from the violent man. </span>
<span class='v S222_4' data-id='S222_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me. </span>
<span class='v S222_5' data-id='S222_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For the waves of death came round me, and the seas of evil put me in fear; </span>
<span class='v S222_6' data-id='S222_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The cords of hell were round me: the nets of death came on me. </span>
<span class='v S222_7' data-id='S222_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In my trouble my voice went up to the Lord, and my cry to my God: my voice came to his hearing in his holy Temple, and my prayer came to his ears. </span>
<span class='v S222_8' data-id='S222_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the earth was moved with a violent shock; the bases of heaven were moved and shaking, because he was angry. </span>
<span class='v S222_9' data-id='S222_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There went up a smoke from his nose, and a fire of destruction from his mouth: coals were lighted by it. </span>
<span class='v S222_10' data-id='S222_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The heavens were bent, so that he might come down; and it was dark under his feet. </span>
<span class='v S222_11' data-id='S222_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he went through the air, seated on a storm-cloud: going quickly on the wings of the wind. </span>
<span class='v S222_12' data-id='S222_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he made the dark his tent round him, a mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies. </span>
<span class='v S222_13' data-id='S222_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Before his shining light his dark clouds went past, raining ice and coals of fire. </span>
<span class='v S222_14' data-id='S222_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The Lord made thunder in the heavens, and the voice of the Highest was sounding out. </span>
<span class='v S222_15' data-id='S222_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he sent out his arrows, driving them in all directions; by his flames of fire they were troubled. </span>
<span class='v S222_16' data-id='S222_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the deep beds of the sea were seen, and the bases of the world were uncovered, because of the Lord's wrath, because of the breath of his mouth. </span>
<span class='v S222_17' data-id='S222_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He sent from on high, he took me, pulling me out of great waters. </span>
<span class='v S222_18' data-id='S222_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He made me free from my strong hater, from those who were against me, because they were stronger than I. </span>
<span class='v S222_19' data-id='S222_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They came on me in the day of my trouble: but the Lord was my support. </span>
<span class='v S222_20' data-id='S222_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He took me out into a wide place; he was my saviour because he had delight in me. </span>
<span class='v S222_21' data-id='S222_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The Lord gives me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean before him. </span>
<span class='v S222_22' data-id='S222_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For I have kept the ways of the Lord; I have not been turned away in sin from my God. </span>
<span class='v S222_23' data-id='S222_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For all his decisions were before me, and I did not put away his laws from me. </span>
<span class='v S222_24' data-id='S222_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And I was upright before him, and I kept myself from sin. </span>
<span class='v S222_25' data-id='S222_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Because of this the Lord has given me the reward of my righteousness, because my hands are clean in his eyes. </span>
<span class='v S222_26' data-id='S222_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>On him who has mercy you will have mercy; to the upright you will be upright; </span>
<span class='v S222_27' data-id='S222_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He who is holy will see that you are holy; but to the man whose way is not straight you will be a hard judge. </span>
<span class='v S222_28' data-id='S222_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For you are the saviour of those who are in trouble; but your eyes are on men of pride, to make them low. </span>
<span class='v S222_29' data-id='S222_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For you are my light, O Lord; and the Lord will make the dark bright for me. </span>
<span class='v S222_30' data-id='S222_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>By your help I have made a way through the wall which was shutting me in: by the help of my God I have gone over a wall. </span>
<span class='v S222_31' data-id='S222_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>As for God, his way is all good: the word of the Lord is tested; he is a safe cover for all those who put their faith in him. </span>
<span class='v S222_32' data-id='S222_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For who is God but the Lord? and who is a Rock but our God? </span>
<span class='v S222_33' data-id='S222_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>God puts a strong band about me, guiding me in a straight way. </span>
<span class='v S222_34' data-id='S222_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>He makes my feet like roes' feet, and puts me on high places. </span>
<span class='v S222_35' data-id='S222_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He makes my hands expert in war, so that a bow of brass is bent by my arms. </span>
<span class='v S222_36' data-id='S222_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>You have given me the breastplate of your salvation, and your mercy has made me great. </span>
<span class='v S222_37' data-id='S222_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>You have made my steps wide under me, so that my feet make no slip. </span>
<span class='v S222_38' data-id='S222_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>I go after my haters and overtake them; not turning back till they are all overcome. </span>
<span class='v S222_39' data-id='S222_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>I have sent destruction on them and given them wounds, so that they are not able to get up: they are stretched under my feet. </span>
<span class='v S222_40' data-id='S222_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>For I have been armed by you with strength for the fight: you have made low under me those who came out against me. </span>
<span class='v S222_41' data-id='S222_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>By you their backs are turned in flight, so that my haters are cut off. </span>
<span class='v S222_42' data-id='S222_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They were crying out, but there was no one to come to their help: even to the Lord, but he gave them no answer. </span>
<span class='v S222_43' data-id='S222_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then they were crushed as small as the dust of the earth, stamped down under my feet like the waste of the streets. </span>
<span class='v S222_44' data-id='S222_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>You have made me free from the fightings of my people; you have made me the head of the nations: a people of whom I had no knowledge will be my servants. </span>
<span class='v S222_45' data-id='S222_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Men of other countries will, with false hearts, put themselves under my authority: from the time when my name comes to their ears, they will be ruled by me. </span>
<span class='v S222_46' data-id='S222_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>They will be wasted away, they will come out of their secret places shaking with fear. </span>
<span class='v S222_47' data-id='S222_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>The Lord is living; praise be to my Rock, and let the God of my salvation be honoured: </span>
<span class='v S222_48' data-id='S222_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>It is God who sends punishment on my haters, and puts peoples under my rule. </span>
<span class='v S222_49' data-id='S222_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>He makes me free from my haters: I am lifted up over those who come up against me: you have made me free from the violent man. </span>
<span class='v S222_50' data-id='S222_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Because of this I will give you praise, O Lord, among the nations, and will make a song of praise to your name. </span>
<span class='v S222_51' data-id='S222_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Great salvation does he give to his king; he has mercy on the king of his selection, David, and on his seed for ever. </span></div></div>
