<span class='v IS1_1' data-id='IS1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw about Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. </span>
<span class='v IS1_2' data-id='IS1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give ear, O heavens, and you, O earth, to the word which the Lord has said: I have taken care of my children till they became men, but their hearts have been turned away from me. </span>
<span class='v IS1_3' data-id='IS1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Even the ox has knowledge of its owner, and the ass of the place where its master puts its food: but Israel has no knowledge, my people give no thought to me. </span>
<span class='v IS1_4' data-id='IS1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>O nation full of sin, a people weighted down with crime, a generation of evil-doers, false-hearted children: they have gone away from the Lord, they have no respect for the Holy One of Israel, their hearts are turned back from him. </span>
<span class='v IS1_5' data-id='IS1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Why will you have more and more punishment? why keep on in your evil ways? Every head is tired and every heart is feeble. </span>
<span class='v IS1_6' data-id='IS1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The body, from head to foot, is all diseased; it is a mass of open wounds, marks of blows, and broken flesh: the flow of blood has not been stopped, and no oil has been put on the wounds. </span>
<span class='v IS1_7' data-id='IS1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Your country has become waste; your towns are burned with fire; as for your land, it is overturned before your eyes, made waste and overcome by men from strange lands. </span>
<span class='v IS1_8' data-id='IS1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the daughter of Zion has become like a tent in a vine-garden, like a watchman's house in a field of fruit, like a town shut in by armies. </span>
<span class='v IS1_9' data-id='IS1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If the Lord of armies had not kept some at least of us safe, we would have been like Sodom, and the fate of Gomorrah would have been ours. </span>
<span class='v IS1_10' data-id='IS1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Give ear to the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; let your hearts be turned to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah. </span>
<span class='v IS1_11' data-id='IS1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>What use to me is the number of the offerings which you give me? says the Lord; your burned offerings of sheep, and the best parts of fat cattle, are a weariness to me; I take no pleasure in the blood of oxen, or of lambs, or of he-goats. </span>
<span class='v IS1_12' data-id='IS1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>At whose request do you come before me, making my house unclean with your feet? </span>
<span class='v IS1_13' data-id='IS1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Give me no more false offerings; the smoke of burning flesh is disgusting to me, so are your new moons and Sabbaths and your holy meetings. </span>
<span class='v IS1_14' data-id='IS1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Your new moons and your regular feasts are a grief to my soul: they are a weight in my spirit; I am crushed under them. </span>
<span class='v IS1_15' data-id='IS1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And when your hands are stretched out to me, my eyes will be turned away from you: even though you go on making prayers, I will not give ear: your hands are full of blood. </span>
<span class='v IS1_16' data-id='IS1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be washed, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; let there be an end of sinning; </span>
<span class='v IS1_17' data-id='IS1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Take pleasure in well-doing; let your ways be upright, keep down the cruel, give a right decision for the child who has no father, see to the cause of the widow. </span>
<span class='v IS1_18' data-id='IS1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Come now, and let us have an argument together, says the Lord: how may your sins which are red like blood be white as snow? how may their dark purple seem like wool? </span>
<span class='v IS1_19' data-id='IS1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If you will give ear to my word and do it, the good things of the land will be yours; </span>
<span class='v IS1_20' data-id='IS1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if your hearts are turned against me, I will send destruction on you by the sword; so the Lord has said. </span>
<span class='v IS1_21' data-id='IS1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The upright town has become untrue; there was a time when her judges gave right decisions, when righteousness had a resting-place in her, but now she is full of those who take men's lives. </span>
<span class='v IS1_22' data-id='IS1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your silver is no longer true metal, your wine is mixed with water. </span>
<span class='v IS1_23' data-id='IS1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Your chiefs have gone against the Lord, they have become friends of thieves; every one of them is looking for profit and going after rewards; they do not give right decisions for the child who has no father, and they do not let the cause of the widow come before them. </span>
<span class='v IS1_24' data-id='IS1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For this reason the Lord, the Lord of armies, the Strong One of Israel, has said, I will put an end to my haters, and send punishment on those who are against me; </span>
<span class='v IS1_25' data-id='IS1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And my hand will again be on you, washing away what is unclean as with soap, and taking away all your false metal; </span>
<span class='v IS1_26' data-id='IS1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I will give you judges again as at the first, and wise guides as in the past; then you will be named, The Town of Righteousness, the true town. </span>
<span class='v IS1_27' data-id='IS1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Upright acts will be the price of Zion's forgiveness, and by righteousness will men be living there. </span>
<span class='v IS1_28' data-id='IS1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But a common destruction will overtake sinners and evil-doers together, and those who have gone away from the Lord will be cut off. </span>
<span class='v IS1_29' data-id='IS1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For you will be put to shame because of the trees of your desire, and because of the gardens of your pleasure. </span>
<span class='v IS1_30' data-id='IS1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For you will be like a tree whose leaves have become dry, and like a garden without water. </span>
<span class='v IS1_31' data-id='IS1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And the strong will be as food for the fire, and his work as a flame; and they will be burned together, with no one to put out the fire. </span></div></div>
