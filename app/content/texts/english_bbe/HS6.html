<span class='v HS6_1' data-id='HS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Come, let us go back to the Lord; for he has given us wounds and he will make us well; he has given blows and he will give help. </span>
<span class='v HS6_2' data-id='HS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>After two days he will give us life, and on the third day he will make us get up, and we will be living before him. </span>
<span class='v HS6_3' data-id='HS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And let us have knowledge, let us go after the knowledge of the Lord; his going out is certain as the dawn, his decisions go out like the light; he will come to us like the rain, like the spring rain watering the earth. </span>
<span class='v HS6_4' data-id='HS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>O Ephraim, what am I to do to you? O Judah, what am I to do to you? For your love is like a morning cloud, and like the dew which goes early away. </span>
<span class='v HS6_5' data-id='HS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So I have had it cut in stones; I gave them teaching by the words of my mouth; </span>
<span class='v HS6_6' data-id='HS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because my desire is for mercy and not offerings; for the knowledge of God more than for burned offerings. </span>
<span class='v HS6_7' data-id='HS6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But like a man, they have gone against the agreement; there they were false to me. </span>
<span class='v HS6_8' data-id='HS6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Gilead is a town of evil-doers, marked with blood. </span>
<span class='v HS6_9' data-id='HS6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And like a band of thieves waiting for a man, so are the priests watching secretly the way of those going quickly to Shechem, for they are working with an evil design. </span>
<span class='v HS6_10' data-id='HS6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In Israel I have seen a very evil thing; there false ways are seen in Ephraim, Israel is unclean; </span>
<span class='v HS6_11' data-id='HS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Judah has put up disgusting images for himself. </span></div></div>
