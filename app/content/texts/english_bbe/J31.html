<span class='v J31_1' data-id='J31_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I, a ruler in the church, send word to the well loved Gaius, for whom I have true love. </span>
<span class='v J31_2' data-id='J31_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>My loved one, it is my prayer that you may do well in all things, and be healthy in body, even as your soul does well. </span>
<span class='v J31_3' data-id='J31_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For it gave me great joy when some of the brothers came and gave witness that you had the true faith and were walking in the true way. </span>
<span class='v J31_4' data-id='J31_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I have no greater joy than to have news that my children are walking in the true way. </span>
<span class='v J31_5' data-id='J31_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My loved one, you are doing a good work in being kind to those brothers who come from other places; </span>
<span class='v J31_6' data-id='J31_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who have given witness to the church of your love for them: and you will do well to send them on their way well cared for, as is right for servants of God: </span>
<span class='v J31_7' data-id='J31_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For they went out for love of the Name, taking nothing from the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v J31_8' data-id='J31_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So it is right for us to take in such men as guests, so that we may take our part in the work of the true faith. </span>
<span class='v J31_9' data-id='J31_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I sent a letter to the church, but Diotrephes, whose desire is ever to have the first place among them, will not have us there. </span>
<span class='v J31_10' data-id='J31_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So if I come, I will keep in mind the things he does, talking against us with evil words: and as if this was not enough, he does not take the brothers into his house, and those who are ready to take them in, he keeps from doing so, putting them out of the church if they do. </span>
<span class='v J31_11' data-id='J31_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My loved one, do not be copying what is evil, but what is good. He who does good is of God: he who does evil has not seen God. </span>
<span class='v J31_12' data-id='J31_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Demetrius has the approval of all men and of what is true: and we give the same witness, and you are certain that our witness is true. </span>
<span class='v J31_13' data-id='J31_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I had much to say to you, but it is not my purpose to put it all down with ink and pen: </span>
<span class='v J31_14' data-id='J31_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But I am hoping to see you in a short time, and to have talk with you face to face. May you have peace. Your friends here send you their love. Give my love to our friends by name. </span></div></div>
