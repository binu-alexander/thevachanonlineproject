<span class='v GN44_1' data-id='GN44_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then he gave orders to the servant who was over his house, saying, Put as much food into the men's bags as will go into them, and put every man's money in the mouth of his bag; </span>
<span class='v GN44_2' data-id='GN44_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And put my cup, my silver cup, in the youngest one's bag, with his money. So he did as Joseph said. </span>
<span class='v GN44_3' data-id='GN44_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And at dawn the men, with their asses, were sent away. </span>
<span class='v GN44_4' data-id='GN44_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when they had gone only a little way out of the town, Joseph said to the servant who was over his house, Go after them; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you done evil in reward for good? </span>
<span class='v GN44_5' data-id='GN44_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Is not this the cup from which my lord takes wine and by which he gets knowledge of the future? Truly, you have done evil. </span>
<span class='v GN44_6' data-id='GN44_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So he overtook them and said these words to them. </span>
<span class='v GN44_7' data-id='GN44_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, Why does my lord say such words as these? far be it from your servants to do such a thing: </span>
<span class='v GN44_8' data-id='GN44_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>See, the money which was in the mouth of our bags we gave back to you when we came again from Canaan: how then might we take silver or gold from your lord's house? </span>
<span class='v GN44_9' data-id='GN44_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If it comes to light that any of your servants has done this, let him be put to death, and we will be your lord's servants. </span>
<span class='v GN44_10' data-id='GN44_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he said, Let it be as you say: he in whose bag it is seen will become my servant; and you will not be responsible. </span>
<span class='v GN44_11' data-id='GN44_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then every man quickly got his bag down and undid it. </span>
<span class='v GN44_12' data-id='GN44_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he made a search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest; and the cup was in Benjamin's bag. </span>
<span class='v GN44_13' data-id='GN44_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then in bitter grief they put the bags on the asses again and went back to the town. </span>
<span class='v GN44_14' data-id='GN44_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was still there: and they went down on their faces before him. </span>
<span class='v GN44_15' data-id='GN44_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said, What is this thing which you have done? had you no thought that such a man as I would have power to see what is secret? </span>
<span class='v GN44_16' data-id='GN44_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Judah said, What are we to say to my lord? how may we put ourselves right in his eyes? God has made clear the sin of your servants: now we are in your hands, we and the man in whose bag your cup was seen. </span>
<span class='v GN44_17' data-id='GN44_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then he said, Far be it from me to do so: but the man who had my cup will be my servant; and you may go back to your father in peace. </span>
<span class='v GN44_18' data-id='GN44_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Judah came near him, and said, Let your servant say a word in my lord's ears, and let not your wrath be burning against your servant: for you are in the place of Pharaoh to us. </span>
<span class='v GN44_19' data-id='GN44_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My lord said to his servants, Have you a father or a brother? </span>
<span class='v GN44_20' data-id='GN44_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And we said to my lord, We have an old father and a young child, whom he had when he was old; his brother is dead and he is the only son of his mother, and is very dear to his father. </span>
<span class='v GN44_21' data-id='GN44_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And you said to your servants, Let him come down to me with you, so that I may see him. </span>
<span class='v GN44_22' data-id='GN44_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And we said to my lord, His father will not let him go; for if he went away his father would come to his death. </span>
<span class='v GN44_23' data-id='GN44_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come with you, you will not see my face again. </span>
<span class='v GN44_24' data-id='GN44_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when we went back to your servant, our father, we gave him an account of my lord's words. </span>
<span class='v GN44_25' data-id='GN44_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And our father said, Go again and get us a little food. </span>
<span class='v GN44_26' data-id='GN44_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And we said, Only if our youngest brother goes with us will we go down; for we may not see the man's face again if our youngest brother is not with us. </span>
<span class='v GN44_27' data-id='GN44_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And our father said to us, You have knowledge that my wife gave me two sons; </span>
<span class='v GN44_28' data-id='GN44_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The one went away from me, and I said, Truly he has come to a violent death; and from that time I have not seen him, </span>
<span class='v GN44_29' data-id='GN44_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>If now you take this one from me, and some evil comes to him, you will make my grey head go down in sorrow to the underworld. </span>
<span class='v GN44_30' data-id='GN44_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If then I go back to your servant, my father, without the boy, because his life and the boy's life are one, </span>
<span class='v GN44_31' data-id='GN44_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>When he sees that the boy is not with us, he will come to his death, and our father's grey head will go down in sorrow to the underworld. </span>
<span class='v GN44_32' data-id='GN44_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For I made myself responsible for the boy to my father, saying, If I do not give him safely back to you, let mine be the sin for ever. </span>
<span class='v GN44_33' data-id='GN44_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So now let me be my lord's servant here in place of the boy, and let him go back with his brothers. </span>
<span class='v GN44_34' data-id='GN44_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For how may I go back to my father without the boy, and see the evil which will come on my father? </span></div></div>
