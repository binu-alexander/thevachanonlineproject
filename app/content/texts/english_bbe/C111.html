<span class='v C111_1' data-id='C111_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So take me for your example, even as I take Christ for mine. </span>
<span class='v C111_2' data-id='C111_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now I am pleased to see that you keep me in memory in all things, and that you give attention to the teaching which was handed down from me to you. </span>
<span class='v C111_3' data-id='C111_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But it is important for you to keep this fact in mind, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. </span>
<span class='v C111_4' data-id='C111_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Every man who takes part in prayer, or gives teaching as a prophet, with his head covered, puts shame on his head. </span>
<span class='v C111_5' data-id='C111_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But every woman who does so with her head unveiled, puts shame on her head: for it is the same as if her hair was cut off. </span>
<span class='v C111_6' data-id='C111_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For if a woman is not veiled, let her hair be cut off; but if it is a shame to a woman to have her hair cut off, let her be veiled. </span>
<span class='v C111_7' data-id='C111_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For it is not right for a man to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. </span>
<span class='v C111_8' data-id='C111_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the man did not come from the woman, but the woman from the man. </span>
<span class='v C111_9' data-id='C111_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the man was not made for the woman, but the woman for the man. </span>
<span class='v C111_10' data-id='C111_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this reason it is right for the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. </span>
<span class='v C111_11' data-id='C111_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the woman is not separate from the man, and the man is not separate from the woman in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C111_12' data-id='C111_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For as the woman is from the man, so the man is through the woman; but all things are from God. </span>
<span class='v C111_13' data-id='C111_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be judges yourselves of the question: does it seem right for a woman to take part in prayer unveiled? </span>
<span class='v C111_14' data-id='C111_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Does it not seem natural to you that if a man has long hair, it is a cause of shame to him? </span>
<span class='v C111_15' data-id='C111_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a covering. </span>
<span class='v C111_16' data-id='C111_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But if any man will not be ruled in this question, this is not our way of doing things, and it is not done in the churches of God. </span>
<span class='v C111_17' data-id='C111_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But in giving you this order, there is one thing about which I am not pleased: it is that when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. </span>
<span class='v C111_18' data-id='C111_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For first of all, it has come to my ears that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and I take the statement to be true in part. </span>
<span class='v C111_19' data-id='C111_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For divisions are necessary among you, in order that those who have God's approval may be clearly seen among you. </span>
<span class='v C111_20' data-id='C111_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But now, when you come together, it is not possible to take the holy meal of the Lord: </span>
<span class='v C111_21' data-id='C111_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For when you take your food, everyone takes his meal before the other; and one has not enough food, and another is the worse for drink. </span>
<span class='v C111_22' data-id='C111_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>What? have you not houses to take your meals in? or have you no respect for the church of God, putting the poor to shame? What am I to say to you? am I to give you praise? certainly not. </span>
<span class='v C111_23' data-id='C111_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For it was handed down to me from the Lord, as I gave it to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when Judas was false to him, took bread, </span>
<span class='v C111_24' data-id='C111_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when it had been broken with an act of praise, he said, This is my body which is for you: do this in memory of me. </span>
<span class='v C111_25' data-id='C111_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the same way, with the cup, after the meal, he said, This cup is the new testament in my blood: do this, whenever you take it, in memory of me. </span>
<span class='v C111_26' data-id='C111_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For whenever you take the bread and the cup you give witness to the Lord's death till he comes. </span>
<span class='v C111_27' data-id='C111_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If, then, anyone takes the bread or the cup of the Lord in the wrong spirit, he will be responsible for the body and blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C111_28' data-id='C111_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But let no man take of the bread and the cup without testing himself. </span>
<span class='v C111_29' data-id='C111_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For a man puts himself in danger, if he takes part in the holy meal without being conscious that it is the Lord's body. </span>
<span class='v C111_30' data-id='C111_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For this cause a number of you are feeble and ill, and a number are dead. </span>
<span class='v C111_31' data-id='C111_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But if we were true judges of ourselves, punishment would not come on us. </span>
<span class='v C111_32' data-id='C111_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But if punishment does come, it is sent by the Lord, so that we may be safe when the world is judged. </span>
<span class='v C111_33' data-id='C111_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So then, my brothers, when you come together to the holy meal of the Lord, let there be waiting for one another. </span>
<span class='v C111_34' data-id='C111_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>If any man is in need of food, let him take his meal in his house; so that you may not come together to your damage. And the rest I will put in order when I come. </span></div></div>
