<span class='v GN23_1' data-id='GN23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the years of Sarah's life were a hundred and twenty-seven. </span>
<span class='v GN23_2' data-id='GN23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Sarah's death took place in Kiriath-arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan: and Abraham went into his house, weeping and sorrowing for Sarah. </span>
<span class='v GN23_3' data-id='GN23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Abraham came from his dead and said to the children of Heth, </span>
<span class='v GN23_4' data-id='GN23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I am living among you as one from a strange country: give me some land here as my property, so that I may put my dead to rest. </span>
<span class='v GN23_5' data-id='GN23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And in answer the children of Heth said to Abraham, </span>
<span class='v GN23_6' data-id='GN23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>My lord, truly you are a great chief among us; take the best of our resting-places for your dead; not one of us will keep back from you a place where you may put your dead to rest. </span>
<span class='v GN23_7' data-id='GN23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Abraham got up and gave honour to the children of Heth, the people of that land. </span>
<span class='v GN23_8' data-id='GN23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, If you will let me put my dead to rest here, make a request for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar, </span>
<span class='v GN23_9' data-id='GN23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>That he will give me the hollow in the rock named Machpelah, which is his property at the end of his field; let him give it to me for its full price as a resting-place for my dead among you. </span>
<span class='v GN23_10' data-id='GN23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now Ephron was seated among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite gave Abraham his answer in the hearing of the children of Heth, and of all those who came into his town, saying, </span>
<span class='v GN23_11' data-id='GN23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>No, my lord, I will give you the field with the hollow in the rock; before all the children of my people will I give it to you for a resting-place for your dead. </span>
<span class='v GN23_12' data-id='GN23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Abraham went down on his face before the people of the land. </span>
<span class='v GN23_13' data-id='GN23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said to Ephron, in the hearing of the people of the land, If only you will give ear to me, I will give you the price of the field; take it, and let me put my dead to rest there. </span>
<span class='v GN23_14' data-id='GN23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So Ephron said to Abraham, </span>
<span class='v GN23_15' data-id='GN23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>My lord, give ear to me: the value of the land is four hundred shekels; what is that between me and you? so put your dead to rest there. </span>
<span class='v GN23_16' data-id='GN23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Abraham took note of the price fixed by Ephron in the hearing of the children of Heth, and gave him four hundred shekels in current money. </span>
<span class='v GN23_17' data-id='GN23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Ephron's field at Machpelah near Mamre, with the hollow in the rock and all the trees in the field and round it, </span>
<span class='v GN23_18' data-id='GN23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Became the property of Abraham before the eyes of the children of Heth and of all who came into the town. </span>
<span class='v GN23_19' data-id='GN23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham put Sarah his wife to rest in the hollow rock in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, that is, Hebron in the land of Canaan. </span>
<span class='v GN23_20' data-id='GN23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the field and the hollow rock were handed over to Abraham as his property by the children of Heth. </span></div></div>
