<span class='v R227_1' data-id='R227_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years; and his mother's name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. </span>
<span class='v R227_2' data-id='R227_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father Uzziah had done; but he did not go into the Temple of the Lord. And the people still went on in their evil ways. </span>
<span class='v R227_3' data-id='R227_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He put up the higher doorway of the house of the Lord, and did much building on the wall of the Ophel. </span>
<span class='v R227_4' data-id='R227_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In addition, he made towns in the hill-country of Judah, and strong buildings and towers in the woodlands. </span>
<span class='v R227_5' data-id='R227_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He went to war with the king of the children of Ammon and overcame them. That year, the children of Ammon gave him a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of grain and ten thousand measures of barley. And the children of Ammon gave him the same amount the second year and the third. </span>
<span class='v R227_6' data-id='R227_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Jotham became strong, because in all his ways he made the Lord his guide. </span>
<span class='v R227_7' data-id='R227_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars and his ways, are recorded in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. </span>
<span class='v R227_8' data-id='R227_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for sixteen years. </span>
<span class='v R227_9' data-id='R227_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Jotham went to rest with his fathers, and they put his body into the earth in the town of David; and Ahaz his son became king in his place. </span></div></div>
