<span class='v MT25_1' data-id='MT25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins, the friends of the bride, who took their lights, and went out with the purpose of meeting the husband. </span>
<span class='v MT25_2' data-id='MT25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And five of them were foolish, and five were wise. </span>
<span class='v MT25_3' data-id='MT25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the foolish, when they took their lights, took no oil with them. </span>
<span class='v MT25_4' data-id='MT25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lights. </span>
<span class='v MT25_5' data-id='MT25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now the husband was a long time in coming, and they all went to sleep. </span>
<span class='v MT25_6' data-id='MT25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But in the middle of the night there is a cry, The husband comes! Go out to him. </span>
<span class='v MT25_7' data-id='MT25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then all those virgins got up, and made ready their lights. </span>
<span class='v MT25_8' data-id='MT25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lights are going out. </span>
<span class='v MT25_9' data-id='MT25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the wise made answer, saying, There may not be enough for us and you; it would be better for you to go to the traders and get oil for yourselves. </span>
<span class='v MT25_10' data-id='MT25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And while they went to get oil, the master came; and those who were ready went in with him to the feast: and the door was shut. </span>
<span class='v MT25_11' data-id='MT25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>After that the other virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, let us in. </span>
<span class='v MT25_12' data-id='MT25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But he made answer and said, Truly I say to you, I have no knowledge of you. </span>
<span class='v MT25_13' data-id='MT25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Keep watch, then, because you are not certain of the day or of the hour. </span>
<span class='v MT25_14' data-id='MT25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For it is as when a man, about to take a journey, got his servants together, and gave them his property. </span>
<span class='v MT25_15' data-id='MT25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And to one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to everyone as he was able; and he went on his journey. </span>
<span class='v MT25_16' data-id='MT25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Straight away he who had been given the five talents went and did trade with them, and made five more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_17' data-id='MT25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In the same way he who had been given the two got two more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_18' data-id='MT25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But he who was given the one went away and put it in a hole in the earth, and kept his lord's money in a secret place. </span>
<span class='v MT25_19' data-id='MT25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now after a long time the lord of those servants comes, and makes up his account with them. </span>
<span class='v MT25_20' data-id='MT25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he who had the five talents came with his other five talents, saying, Lord, you gave into my care five talents: see, I have got five more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_21' data-id='MT25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord. </span>
<span class='v MT25_22' data-id='MT25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he who had the two talents came and said, Lord, you gave into my care two talents: see, I have got two more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_23' data-id='MT25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>His lord said to him, Well done, good and true servant: you have been true in a small thing, I will give you control over great things: take your part in the joy of your lord. </span>
<span class='v MT25_24' data-id='MT25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And he who had had the one talent came and said, Lord, I had knowledge that you are a hard man, getting in grain where you have not put seed, and making profits for which you have done no work: </span>
<span class='v MT25_25' data-id='MT25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And I was in fear, and went away, and put your talent in the earth: here is what is yours. </span>
<span class='v MT25_26' data-id='MT25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But his lord in answer said to him, You are a bad and unready servant; if you had knowledge that I get in grain where I did not put seed, and make profits for which I have done no work, </span>
<span class='v MT25_27' data-id='MT25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Why, then, did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I would have got back what is mine with interest? </span>
<span class='v MT25_28' data-id='MT25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Take away, then, his talent and give it to him who has the ten talents. </span>
<span class='v MT25_29' data-id='MT25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have more: but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. </span>
<span class='v MT25_30' data-id='MT25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And put out the servant who is of no profit into the outer dark: there will be weeping and cries of sorrow. </span>
<span class='v MT25_31' data-id='MT25_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he be seated in his glory: </span>
<span class='v MT25_32' data-id='MT25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And before him all the nations will come together; and they will be parted one from another, as the sheep are parted from the goats by the keeper. </span>
<span class='v MT25_33' data-id='MT25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he will put the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. </span>
<span class='v MT25_34' data-id='MT25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then will the King say to those on his right, Come, you who have the blessing of my Father, into the kingdom made ready for you before the world was: </span>
<span class='v MT25_35' data-id='MT25_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>For I was in need of food, and you gave it to me: I was in need of drink, and you gave it to me: I was wandering, and you took me in; </span>
<span class='v MT25_36' data-id='MT25_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>I had no clothing, and you gave it to me: when I was ill, or in prison, you came to me. </span>
<span class='v MT25_37' data-id='MT25_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then will the upright make answer to him, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food, and give it to you? or in need of drink, and give it to you? </span>
<span class='v MT25_38' data-id='MT25_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And when did we see you wandering, and take you in? or without clothing, and give it to you? </span>
<span class='v MT25_39' data-id='MT25_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when did we see you ill, or in prison, and come to you? </span>
<span class='v MT25_40' data-id='MT25_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And the King will make answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Because you did it to the least of these my brothers, you did it to me. </span>
<span class='v MT25_41' data-id='MT25_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then will he say to those on the left, Go from me, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire which is ready for the Evil One and his angels: </span>
<span class='v MT25_42' data-id='MT25_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For I was in need of food, and you gave it not to me; I was in need of drink, and you gave it not to me: </span>
<span class='v MT25_43' data-id='MT25_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>I was wandering, and you took me not in; without clothing, and you gave me no clothing; ill, and in prison, and you came not to me. </span>
<span class='v MT25_44' data-id='MT25_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then will they make answer, saying, Lord, when did we see you in need of food or drink, or wandering, or without clothing, or ill, or in prison, and did not take care of you? </span>
<span class='v MT25_45' data-id='MT25_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then will he make answer to them, saying, Truly I say to you, Because you did it not to the least of these, you did it not to me. </span>
<span class='v MT25_46' data-id='MT25_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the upright into eternal life. </span></div></div>
