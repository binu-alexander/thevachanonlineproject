<span class='v EK15_2' data-id='EK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any branching tree which is among the trees of the woods? </span>
<span class='v EK15_3' data-id='EK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Will its wood be used for any work? do men make of it a pin for hanging any vessel on? </span>
<span class='v EK15_4' data-id='EK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>See, it is put into the fire for burning: the fire has made a meal of its two ends and the middle part of it is burned; is it good for any work? </span>
<span class='v EK15_5' data-id='EK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Truly, before it was cut down, it was not used for any purpose: how much less, when the fire has made a meal of it and it is burned, will it be made into anything? </span>
<span class='v EK15_6' data-id='EK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause the Lord has said: Like the vine-tree among the trees of the woods which I have given to the fire for burning, so will I give the people of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v EK15_7' data-id='EK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And my face will be turned against them; and though they have come out of the fire they will be burned up by it; and it will be clear to you that I am the Lord when my face is turned against them. </span>
