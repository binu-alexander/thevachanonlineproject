<span class='v SS7_1' data-id='SS7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>How beautiful are your feet in their shoes, O king's daughter! The curves of your legs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a good workman: </span>
<span class='v SS7_2' data-id='SS7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Your stomach is a store of grain with lilies round it, and in the middle a round cup full of wine. </span>
<span class='v SS7_3' data-id='SS7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth. </span>
<span class='v SS7_4' data-id='SS7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the waters in Heshbon, by the doorway of Bath-rabbim; your nose is as the tower on Lebanon looking over Damascus: </span>
<span class='v SS7_5' data-id='SS7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Your head is like Carmel, and the hair of your head is like purple, in whose net the king is prisoner. </span>
<span class='v SS7_6' data-id='SS7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>How beautiful and how sweet you are, O love, for delight. </span>
<span class='v SS7_7' data-id='SS7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You are tall like a palm-tree, and your breasts are like the fruit of the vine. </span>
<span class='v SS7_8' data-id='SS7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I said, Let me go up the palm-tree, and let me take its branches in my hands: your breasts will be as the fruit of the vine, and the smell of your breath like apples; </span>
<span class='v SS7_9' data-id='SS7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the roof of your mouth like good wine flowing down smoothly for my loved one, moving gently over my lips and my teeth. </span>
<span class='v SS7_10' data-id='SS7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am for my loved one, and his desire is for me. </span>
<span class='v SS7_11' data-id='SS7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Come, my loved one, let us go out into the field; let us take rest among the cypress-trees. </span>
<span class='v SS7_12' data-id='SS7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let us go out early to the vine-gardens; let us see if the vine is in bud, if it has put out its young fruit, and the pomegranate is in flower. There I will give you my love. </span>
<span class='v SS7_13' data-id='SS7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The mandrakes give out a sweet smell, and at our doors are all sorts of good fruits, new and old, which I have kept for my loved one. </span></div></div>
