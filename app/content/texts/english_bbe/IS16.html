<span class='v IS16_1' data-id='IS16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And they will send ... to the mountain of the daughter of Zion. </span>
<span class='v IS16_2' data-id='IS16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For the daughters of Moab will be like wandering birds, like a place from which the young birds have gone in flight, at the ways across the Arnon. </span>
<span class='v IS16_3' data-id='IS16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Give wise directions, make a decision; let your shade be as night in full day: keep safe those who are in flight; do not give up the wandering ones. </span>
<span class='v IS16_4' data-id='IS16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let those who have been forced out of Moab have a resting-place with you; be a cover to them from him who is making waste their land: till the cruel ones are cut off, and wasting has come to an end, and those who take pleasure in crushing the poor are gone from the land. </span>
<span class='v IS16_5' data-id='IS16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then a king's seat will be based on mercy, and one will be seated on it in the tent of David for ever; judging uprightly, and quick to do righteousness. </span>
<span class='v IS16_6' data-id='IS16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We have had word of the pride of Moab, how great it is; how he is lifted up in pride and passion: his high words about himself are false. </span>
<span class='v IS16_7' data-id='IS16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For this cause everyone in Moab will give cries of grief for Moab: crushed to the earth, they will be weeping for the men of Kir-hareseth. </span>
<span class='v IS16_8' data-id='IS16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the fields of Heshbon are waste, the vine of Sibmah is dead; the lords of nations were overcome by the produce of her vines; her vine-plants went as far as Jazer, and came even to the waste land; her branches were stretched out to the sea. </span>
<span class='v IS16_9' data-id='IS16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this cause my sorrow for the vine of Sibmah will be like the weeping for Jazer: my eyes are dropping water on you, O Heshbon and Elealeh! For they are sounding the war-cry over your summer fruits and the getting in of your grain; </span>
<span class='v IS16_10' data-id='IS16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And all joy is gone; no longer are they glad for the fertile field; and in the vine-gardens there are no songs or sounds of joy: the crushing of grapes has come to an end, and its glad cry has been stopped. </span>
<span class='v IS16_11' data-id='IS16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For this cause the cords of my heart are sounding for Moab, and I am full of sorrow for Kir-heres. </span>
<span class='v IS16_12' data-id='IS16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when Moab goes up to the high place, and makes prayer in the house of his god, it will have no effect. </span>
<span class='v IS16_13' data-id='IS16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is the word which the Lord said about Moab in the past. </span>
<span class='v IS16_14' data-id='IS16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But now the Lord has said, In three years, the years of a servant working for payment, the glory of Moab, all that great people, will be turned to shame, and the rest of Moab will be very small and without honour. </span></div></div>
