<span class='v RM12_1' data-id='RM12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this reason I make request to you, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you will give your bodies as a living offering, holy, pleasing to God, which is the worship it is right for you to give him. </span>
<span class='v RM12_2' data-id='RM12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And let not your behaviour be like that of this world, but be changed and made new in mind, so that by experience you may have knowledge of the good and pleasing and complete purpose of God. </span>
<span class='v RM12_3' data-id='RM12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I say to every one of you, through the grace given to me, not to have an over-high opinion of himself, but to have wise thoughts, as God has given to every one a measure of faith. </span>
<span class='v RM12_4' data-id='RM12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For, as we have a number of parts in one body, but all the parts have not the same use, </span>
<span class='v RM12_5' data-id='RM12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So we, though we are a number of persons, are one body in Christ, and are dependent on one another; </span>
<span class='v RM12_6' data-id='RM12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And having different qualities by reason of the grace given to us, such as the quality of a prophet, let it be made use of in relation to the measure of our faith; </span>
<span class='v RM12_7' data-id='RM12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Or the position of a Deacon of the church, let a man give himself to it; or he who has the power of teaching, let him make use of it; </span>
<span class='v RM12_8' data-id='RM12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He who has the power of comforting, let him do so; he who gives, let him give freely; he who has the power of ruling, let him do it with a serious mind; he who has mercy on others, let it be with joy. </span>
<span class='v RM12_9' data-id='RM12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let love be without deceit. Be haters of what is evil; keep your minds fixed on what is good. </span>
<span class='v RM12_10' data-id='RM12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Be kind to one another with a brother's love, putting others before yourselves in honour; </span>
<span class='v RM12_11' data-id='RM12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Be not slow in your work, but be quick in spirit, as the Lord's servants; </span>
<span class='v RM12_12' data-id='RM12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Being glad in hope, quiet in trouble, at all times given to prayer, </span>
<span class='v RM12_13' data-id='RM12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Giving to the needs of the saints, ready to take people into your houses. </span>
<span class='v RM12_14' data-id='RM12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Give blessing and not curses to those who are cruel to you. </span>
<span class='v RM12_15' data-id='RM12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Take part in the joy of those who are glad, and in the grief of those who are sorrowing. </span>
<span class='v RM12_16' data-id='RM12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be in harmony with one another. Do not have a high opinion of yourselves, but be in agreement with common people. Do not give yourselves an air of wisdom. </span>
<span class='v RM12_17' data-id='RM12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Do not give evil for evil to any man. Let all your business be well ordered in the eyes of all men. </span>
<span class='v RM12_18' data-id='RM12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>As far as it is possible for you be at peace with all men. </span>
<span class='v RM12_19' data-id='RM12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not give punishment for wrongs done to you, dear brothers, but give way to the wrath of God; for it is said in the holy Writings, Punishment is mine, I will give reward, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v RM12_20' data-id='RM12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if one who has hate for you is in need of food or of drink, give it to him, for in so doing you will put coals of fire on his head. </span>
<span class='v RM12_21' data-id='RM12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not let evil overcome you, but overcome evil by good. </span></div></div>
