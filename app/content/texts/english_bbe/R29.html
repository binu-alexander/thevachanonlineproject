<span class='v R29_1' data-id='R29_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the queen of Sheba, hearing great things of Solomon, came to Jerusalem to put his wisdom to the test with hard questions; and with her came a very great train, and camels weighted down with spices, and great stores of gold and jewels: and when she came to Solomon she had talk with him of everything in her mind. </span>
<span class='v R29_2' data-id='R29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Solomon gave her answers to all her questions; there was no secret which he did not make clear to her. </span>
<span class='v R29_3' data-id='R29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he had made, </span>
<span class='v R29_4' data-id='R29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the food at his table, and all his servants seated there, and those who were waiting on him in their places, and their robes, and his wine-servants and their robes, and the burned offerings which he made in the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her. </span>
<span class='v R29_5' data-id='R29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And she said to the king, The account which was given to me in my country of your acts and your wisdom was true. </span>
<span class='v R29_6' data-id='R29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But I had no faith in what was said about you, till I came and saw for myself; and truly, word was not given me of half your great wisdom; you are much greater than they said. </span>
<span class='v R29_7' data-id='R29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Happy are your wives and happy these your servants whose place is ever before you, hearing your words of wisdom. </span>
<span class='v R29_8' data-id='R29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Praise be to the Lord your God whose pleasure it was to put you on the seat of his kingdom to be king for the Lord your God: because, in his love for Israel, it was the purpose of your God to make them strong for ever, he made you king over them, to be their judge in righteousness. </span>
<span class='v R29_9' data-id='R29_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a great store of spices and jewels: never had such spices been seen as the queen of Sheba gave to Solomon. </span>
<span class='v R29_10' data-id='R29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, in addition to gold from Ophir, came back with sandal-wood and jewels. </span>
<span class='v R29_11' data-id='R29_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And with the sandal-wood the king made steps for the house of the Lord and for the king's house, and instruments of music for the makers of melody; never before had such been seen in the land of Judah. </span>
<span class='v R29_12' data-id='R29_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she made request for, in addition to what she had taken to the king. So she went back to her country with her servants. </span>
<span class='v R29_13' data-id='R29_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now the weight of gold which came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents; </span>
<span class='v R29_14' data-id='R29_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And in addition to what he got from traders of different sorts, all the kings of Arabia and the rulers of the country gave gold and silver to Solomon. </span>
<span class='v R29_15' data-id='R29_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon made two hundred body-covers of hammered gold, every one having six hundred shekels of gold in it. </span>
<span class='v R29_16' data-id='R29_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he made three hundred smaller body-covers of hammered gold, using three hundred shekels of gold for every cover, and the king put them in the house of the Woods of Lebanon. </span>
<span class='v R29_17' data-id='R29_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the king made a great ivory seat, plated with the best gold. </span>
<span class='v R29_18' data-id='R29_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There were six steps up to it, and a foot-rest of gold fixed to it, and arms on the two sides of the seat, with two lions at the side of the arms. </span>
<span class='v R29_19' data-id='R29_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And twelve lions were placed on one side and on the other side on the six steps: there was nothing like it in any kingdom. </span>
<span class='v R29_20' data-id='R29_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>All King Solomon's drinking-vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Woods of Lebanon were of the best gold: no one gave a thought to silver in the days of Solomon. </span>
<span class='v R29_21' data-id='R29_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For the king had Tarshish-ships sailing with the servants of Huram: once every three years the Tarshish-ships came back with gold and silver, ivory and monkeys and peacocks. </span>
<span class='v R29_22' data-id='R29_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom. </span>
<span class='v R29_23' data-id='R29_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And all the kings of the earth came to see Solomon and to give ear to his wisdom, which God had put into his heart. </span>
<span class='v R29_24' data-id='R29_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And everyone took with him an offering, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and robes, and coats of metal, and spices, and horses and beasts for transport, regularly year by year. </span>
<span class='v R29_25' data-id='R29_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Solomon had four thousand buildings for his horses and his war-carriages, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he kept, some in the carriage-towns and some with the king in Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R29_26' data-id='R29_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he was ruler over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the limit of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v R29_27' data-id='R29_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem and cedars like the sycamore-trees of the lowlands in number. </span>
<span class='v R29_28' data-id='R29_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>They got horses for Solomon from Egypt and from every land. </span>
<span class='v R29_29' data-id='R29_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not recorded in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the words of Ahijah the prophet of Shiloh, and in the visions of Iddo the seer about Jeroboam, the son of Nebat? </span>
<span class='v R29_30' data-id='R29_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Solomon was king over Israel in Jerusalem for forty years. </span>
<span class='v R29_31' data-id='R29_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And Solomon went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David his father; and Rehoboam his son became king in his place. </span></div></div>
