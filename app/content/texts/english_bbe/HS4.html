<span class='v HS4_1' data-id='HS4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear to the word of the Lord, O children of Israel; for the Lord has a cause against the people of this land, because there is no good faith in it, and no mercy and no knowledge of God in the land. </span>
<span class='v HS4_2' data-id='HS4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>There is cursing and broken faith, violent death and attacks on property, men are untrue in married life, houses are broken into, and there is blood touching blood. </span>
<span class='v HS4_3' data-id='HS4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Because of this the land will be dry, and everyone living in it will be wasted away, with the beasts of the field and the birds of heaven; even the fishes of the sea will be taken away. </span>
<span class='v HS4_4' data-id='HS4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let no man go to law or make protests, for your people are like those who go to law with a priest. </span>
<span class='v HS4_5' data-id='HS4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You will not be able to keep on your feet by day, and by night the prophet will be falling down with you, and I will give your mother to destruction. </span>
<span class='v HS4_6' data-id='HS4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Destruction has overtaken my people because they have no knowledge; because you have given up knowledge, I will give you up, so that you will be no priest to me, because you have not kept in mind the law of your God, I will not keep your children in my memory. </span>
<span class='v HS4_7' data-id='HS4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Even while they were increasing in number they were sinning against me; I will let their glory be changed into shame. </span>
<span class='v HS4_8' data-id='HS4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The sin of my people is like food to them; and their desire is for their wrongdoing. </span>
<span class='v HS4_9' data-id='HS4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the priest will be like the people; I will give them punishment for their evil ways, and the reward of their acts. </span>
<span class='v HS4_10' data-id='HS4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They will have food, but they will not be full; they will be false to me, but they will not be increased, because they no longer give thought to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS4_11' data-id='HS4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Loose ways and new wine take away wisdom. </span>
<span class='v HS4_12' data-id='HS4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My people get knowledge from their tree, and their rod gives them news; for a false spirit is the cause of their wandering, and they have been false to their God. </span>
<span class='v HS4_13' data-id='HS4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They make offerings on the tops of mountains, burning perfumes in high places, under trees of every sort, because their shade is good: and so your daughters are given up to loose ways and your brides are false to their husbands. </span>
<span class='v HS4_14' data-id='HS4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will not give punishment to your daughters or your brides for their evil behaviour; for they make themselves separate with loose women, and make offerings with those who are used for sex purposes in the worship of the gods: the people who have no wisdom will be sent away. </span>
<span class='v HS4_15' data-id='HS4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not you, O Israel, come into error; do not you, O Judah, come to Gilgal, or go up to Beth-aven, or take an oath, By the living Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS4_16' data-id='HS4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For Israel is uncontrolled, like a cow which may not be controlled; now will the Lord give them food like a lamb in a wide place. </span>
<span class='v HS4_17' data-id='HS4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is joined to false gods; let him be. </span>
<span class='v HS4_18' data-id='HS4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Their drink has become bitter; they are completely false; her rulers take pleasure in shame. </span>
<span class='v HS4_19' data-id='HS4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They are folded in the skirts of the wind; they will be shamed because of their offerings. </span></div></div>
