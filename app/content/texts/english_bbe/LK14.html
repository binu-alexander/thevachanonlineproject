<span class='v LK14_1' data-id='LK14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And it came about that when he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees on the Sabbath, to have a meal, they were watching him. </span>
<span class='v LK14_2' data-id='LK14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And a certain man was there who had a disease. </span>
<span class='v LK14_3' data-id='LK14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, answering, said to the scribes and Pharisees, Is it right to make people well on the Sabbath or not? </span>
<span class='v LK14_4' data-id='LK14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But they said nothing. And he made him well and sent him away. </span>
<span class='v LK14_5' data-id='LK14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Which of you, whose ox or ass has got into a water-hole, will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath? </span>
<span class='v LK14_6' data-id='LK14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they had no answer to that question. </span>
<span class='v LK14_7' data-id='LK14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast, when he saw how they took the best seats; saying to them, </span>
<span class='v LK14_8' data-id='LK14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When you get a request to come to a feast, do not take the best seat, for a more important man than you may be coming, </span>
<span class='v LK14_9' data-id='LK14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say, Give your place to this man; and you, with shame, will have to take the lowest seat. </span>
<span class='v LK14_10' data-id='LK14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But when you come, go and take the lowest seat, so that when the giver of the feast comes, he may say to you, Friend, come up higher; and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there. </span>
<span class='v LK14_11' data-id='LK14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down, but he who takes a low place will be lifted up. </span>
<span class='v LK14_12' data-id='LK14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he said to the master of the house, When you give a feast, do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth, for they may give a feast for you, and so you will get a reward. </span>
<span class='v LK14_13' data-id='LK14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But when you give a feast, send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body: </span>
<span class='v LK14_14' data-id='LK14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And you will have a blessing, because they will not be able to give you any payment, and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead. </span>
<span class='v LK14_15' data-id='LK14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And, hearing these words, one of those who were at table with him said to him, Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v LK14_16' data-id='LK14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, A certain man gave a great feast, and sent word of it to a number of people. </span>
<span class='v LK14_17' data-id='LK14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when the time had come, he sent his servants to say to them, Come, for all things are now ready. </span>
<span class='v LK14_18' data-id='LK14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come. The first said to him, I have got a new field, and it is necessary for me to go and see it: I am full of regret that I am unable to come. </span>
<span class='v LK14_19' data-id='LK14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And another said, I have got some cattle, and I am going to make a test of them: I am full of regret that I am unable to come. </span>
<span class='v LK14_20' data-id='LK14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And another said, I have been married, and so I am not able to come. </span>
<span class='v LK14_21' data-id='LK14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things. Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant, Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor, the blind, and those who are broken in body. </span>
<span class='v LK14_22' data-id='LK14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the servant said, Lord, your orders have been done, and still there is room. </span>
<span class='v LK14_23' data-id='LK14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the roads and the fields, and make them come in, so that my house may be full. </span>
<span class='v LK14_24' data-id='LK14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast. </span>
<span class='v LK14_25' data-id='LK14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now a great number of people went with him. </span>
<span class='v LK14_26' data-id='LK14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And turning round, he said to them, If any man comes to me, and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and even for his life, he may not be my disciple. </span>
<span class='v LK14_27' data-id='LK14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple. </span>
<span class='v LK14_28' data-id='LK14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For which of you, desiring to put up a tower, does not first give much thought to the price, if he will have enough to make it complete? </span>
<span class='v LK14_29' data-id='LK14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end, all who see it will be laughing at him, </span>
<span class='v LK14_30' data-id='LK14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And saying, This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete. </span>
<span class='v LK14_31' data-id='LK14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Or what king, going to war with another king, will not first take thought if he will be strong enough, with ten thousand men, to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand? </span>
<span class='v LK14_32' data-id='LK14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Or while the other is still a great distance away, he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace. </span>
<span class='v LK14_33' data-id='LK14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple. </span>
<span class='v LK14_34' data-id='LK14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For salt is good, but if the taste goes from it, of what use is it? </span>
<span class='v LK14_35' data-id='LK14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>It is no good for the land or for the place of waste; no one has a use for it. He who has ears, let him give ear. </span></div></div>
