<span class='v GN49_4' data-id='GN49_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But because you were uncontrolled, the first place will not be yours; for you went up to your father's bed, even his bride-bed, and made it unclean. </span>
<span class='v GN49_5' data-id='GN49_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Simeon and Levi are brothers; deceit and force are their secret designs. </span>
<span class='v GN49_6' data-id='GN49_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Take no part in their secrets, O my soul; keep far away, O my heart, from their meetings; for in their wrath they put men to death, and for their pleasure even oxen were wounded. </span>
<span class='v GN49_7' data-id='GN49_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A curse on their passion for it was bitter; and on their wrath for it was cruel. I will let their heritage in Jacob be broken up, driving them from their places in Israel. </span>

<span class='v GN49_11' data-id='GN49_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Knotting his ass's cord to the vine, and his young ass to the best vine; washing his robe in wine, and his clothing in the blood of grapes: </span>

<span class='v GN49_22' data-id='GN49_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Joseph is a young ox, whose steps are turned to the fountain; </span>
<span class='v GN49_23' data-id='GN49_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He was troubled by the archers; they sent out their arrows against him, cruelly wounding him: </span>
<span class='v GN49_24' data-id='GN49_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But their bows were broken by a strong one, and the cords of their arms were cut by the Strength of Jacob, by the name of the Stone of Israel: </span>
<span class='v GN49_25' data-id='GN49_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Even by the God of your father, who will be your help, and by the Ruler of all, who will make you full with blessings from heaven on high, blessings of the deep stretched out under the earth, blessings of the breasts and of the fertile body: </span>
<span class='v GN49_26' data-id='GN49_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Blessings of sons, old and young, to the father: blessings of the oldest mountains and the fruit of the eternal hills: let them come on the head of Joseph, on the crown of him who was separate from his brothers. </span>
