<span class='v GN24_1' data-id='GN24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham was old and far on in years: and the Lord had given him everything in full measure. </span>
<span class='v GN24_2' data-id='GN24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said to his chief servant, the manager of all his property, Come now, put your hand under my leg: </span>
<span class='v GN24_3' data-id='GN24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And take an oath by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not get a wife for my son Isaac from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living; </span>
<span class='v GN24_4' data-id='GN24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But that you will go into my country and to my relations and get a wife there for my son Isaac. </span>
<span class='v GN24_5' data-id='GN24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the servant said, If by chance the woman will not come with me into this land, am I to take your son back again to the land from which you came? </span>
<span class='v GN24_6' data-id='GN24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said, Take care that you do not let my son go back to that land. </span>
<span class='v GN24_7' data-id='GN24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The Lord God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from the land of my birth, and made an oath to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land: he will send his angel before you and give you a wife for my son in that land. </span>
<span class='v GN24_8' data-id='GN24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And if the woman will not come with you, then you are free from this oath; only do not take my son back there. </span>
<span class='v GN24_9' data-id='GN24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the servant put his hand under Abraham's leg, and gave him his oath about this thing. </span>
<span class='v GN24_10' data-id='GN24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the servant took ten of his master's camels, and all sorts of good things of his master's, and went to Mesopotamia, to the town of Nahor. </span>
<span class='v GN24_11' data-id='GN24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he made the camels take their rest outside the town by the water-spring in the evening, at the time when the women came to get water. </span>
<span class='v GN24_12' data-id='GN24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, let me do well in what I have undertaken this day, and give your mercy to my master Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GN24_13' data-id='GN24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>See, I am waiting here by the water-spring; and the daughters of the town are coming out to get water: </span>
<span class='v GN24_14' data-id='GN24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now, may the girl to whom I say, Let down your vessel and give me a drink, and who says in answer, Here is a drink for you and let me give water to your camels: may she be the one marked out by you for your servant Isaac: so may I be certain that you have been good to my master Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GN24_15' data-id='GN24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And even before his words were ended, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water-vessel on her arm. </span>
<span class='v GN24_16' data-id='GN24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>She was a very beautiful girl, a virgin, who had never been touched by a man: and she went down to the spring to get water in her vessel. </span>
<span class='v GN24_17' data-id='GN24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the servant came running to her and said, Give me a little water from your vessel. </span>
<span class='v GN24_18' data-id='GN24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And she said, Take a drink, my lord: and quickly letting down her vessel onto her hand, she gave him a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN24_19' data-id='GN24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And having done so, she said, I will get water for your camels till they have had enough. </span>
<span class='v GN24_20' data-id='GN24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And after putting the water from her vessel into the animals' drinking-place, she went quickly back to the spring and got water for all the camels. </span>
<span class='v GN24_21' data-id='GN24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the man, looking at her, said nothing, waiting to see if the Lord had given his journey a good outcome. </span>
<span class='v GN24_22' data-id='GN24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And when the camels had had enough, the man took a gold nose-ring, half a shekel in weight, and two ornaments for her arms of ten shekels weight of gold; </span>
<span class='v GN24_23' data-id='GN24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And said to her, Whose daughter are you? is there room in your father's house for us? </span>
<span class='v GN24_24' data-id='GN24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, Nahor's wife. </span>
<span class='v GN24_25' data-id='GN24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And she said, We have a great store of dry grass and cattle-food, and there is room for you. </span>
<span class='v GN24_26' data-id='GN24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And with bent head the man gave worship to the Lord; </span>
<span class='v GN24_27' data-id='GN24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And said, Praise be to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has given a sign that he is good and true to my master, by guiding me straight to the house of my master's family. </span>
<span class='v GN24_28' data-id='GN24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So the girl went running and took the news of these things to her mother's house </span>
<span class='v GN24_29' data-id='GN24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he came out quickly to the man at the water-spring. </span>
<span class='v GN24_30' data-id='GN24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And when he saw the nose-ring and the ornaments on his sister's hands, and when she gave him word of what the man had said to her, then he went out to the man who was waiting with the camels by the water-spring. </span>
<span class='v GN24_31' data-id='GN24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Come in, you on whom is the blessing of the Lord; why are you waiting outside? for I have made the house ready for you, and a place for the camels. </span>
<span class='v GN24_32' data-id='GN24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then the man came into the house, and Laban took their cords off the camels and gave them dry grass and food, and he gave to him and the men who were with him water for washing their feet. </span>
<span class='v GN24_33' data-id='GN24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And meat was put before him, but he said, I will not take food till I have made my business clear to you. And they said, Do so. </span>
<span class='v GN24_34' data-id='GN24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And he said, I am Abraham's servant. </span>
<span class='v GN24_35' data-id='GN24_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The Lord has given my master every blessing, and he has become great: he has given him flocks and herds and silver and gold, and men-servants and women-servants and camels and asses. </span>
<span class='v GN24_36' data-id='GN24_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And when Sarah, my master's wife, was old, she gave birth to a son, to whom he has given all he has. </span>
<span class='v GN24_37' data-id='GN24_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And my master made me take an oath, saying, Do not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I am living; </span>
<span class='v GN24_38' data-id='GN24_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But go to my father's house and to my relations for a wife for my son. </span>
<span class='v GN24_39' data-id='GN24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And I said to my master, What if the woman will not come with me? </span>
<span class='v GN24_40' data-id='GN24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And he said, The Lord, whom I have ever kept before me, will send his angel with you, who will make it possible for you to get a wife for my son from my relations and my father's house; </span>
<span class='v GN24_41' data-id='GN24_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And you will be free from your oath to me when you come to my people; and if they will not give her to you, you will be free from your oath. </span>
<span class='v GN24_42' data-id='GN24_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And I came today to the water-spring, and I said, O Lord, the God of my master Abraham, if it is your purpose to give a good outcome to my journey, </span>
<span class='v GN24_43' data-id='GN24_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Let it come about that, while I am waiting here by the water-spring, if a girl comes to get water and I say to her, Give me a little water from your vessel, and she says, </span>
<span class='v GN24_44' data-id='GN24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels; let her be the woman marked out by the Lord for my master's son. </span>
<span class='v GN24_45' data-id='GN24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And even while I was saying this to myself, Rebekah came out with her vessel on her arm; and she went down to the spring to get water; and I said to her, Give me a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN24_46' data-id='GN24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And straight away she took down her vessel from her arm, and said, Take a drink, and I will get water for your camels. </span>
<span class='v GN24_47' data-id='GN24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And questioning her, I said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, and Milcah his wife. Then I put the ring on her nose and the ornaments on her hands. </span>
<span class='v GN24_48' data-id='GN24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And with bent head I gave worship and praise to the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, by whom I had been guided in the right way, to get the daughter of my master's brother for his son. </span>
<span class='v GN24_49' data-id='GN24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And now, say if you will do what is good and right for my master or not, in order that it may be clear to me what I have to do. </span>
<span class='v GN24_50' data-id='GN24_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Then Laban and Bethuel said in answer, This is the Lord's doing: it is not for us to say Yes or No to you. </span>
<span class='v GN24_51' data-id='GN24_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>See, here is Rebekah: take her and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as the Lord has said. </span>
<span class='v GN24_52' data-id='GN24_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And at these words, Abraham's servant went down on his face and gave praise to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v GN24_53' data-id='GN24_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Then he took jewels of silver and jewels of gold and fair robes and gave them to Rebekah: and he gave things of value to her mother and her brother. </span>
<span class='v GN24_54' data-id='GN24_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Then he and the men who were with him had food and drink, and took their rest there that night; and in the morning he got up, and said, Let me now go back to my master. </span>
<span class='v GN24_55' data-id='GN24_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>But her brother and her mother said, Let the girl be with us a week or ten days, and then she may go. </span>
<span class='v GN24_56' data-id='GN24_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And he said, Do not keep me; the Lord has given a good outcome to my journey; let me now go back to my master. </span>
<span class='v GN24_57' data-id='GN24_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>And they said, We will send for the girl, and let her make the decision. </span>
<span class='v GN24_58' data-id='GN24_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>And they sent for Rebekah and said to her, Are you ready to go with this man? And she said, I am ready. </span>
<span class='v GN24_59' data-id='GN24_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>So they sent their sister Rebekah and her servant with Abraham's servant and his men. </span>
<span class='v GN24_60' data-id='GN24_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>And they gave Rebekah their blessing, saying, O sister, may you be the mother of thousands and ten thousands; and may your seed overcome all those who make war against them. </span>
<span class='v GN24_61' data-id='GN24_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>So Rebekah and her servant-women went with the man, seated on the camels; and so the servant took Rebekah and went on his way. </span>
<span class='v GN24_62' data-id='GN24_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac had come through the waste land to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the South. </span>
<span class='v GN24_63' data-id='GN24_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>And when the evening was near, he went wandering out into the fields, and lifting up his eyes he saw camels coming. </span>
<span class='v GN24_64' data-id='GN24_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>And when Rebekah, looking up, saw Isaac, she got down from her camel, </span>
<span class='v GN24_65' data-id='GN24_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And said to the servant, Who is that man coming to us through the field? And the servant said, It is my master: then she took her veil, covering her face with it. </span>
<span class='v GN24_66' data-id='GN24_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>Then the servant gave Isaac the story of all he had done. </span>
<span class='v GN24_67' data-id='GN24_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>And Isaac took Rebekah into his tent and she became his wife; and in his love for her, Isaac was comforted after his father's death. </span></div></div>
