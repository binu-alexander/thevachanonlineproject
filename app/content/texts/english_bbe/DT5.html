<span class='v DT5_1' data-id='DT5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Moses sent for all Israel, and said to them, Give ear, O Israel, to the laws and the decisions which I give you today, and give attention to them so that you may keep and do them. </span>
<span class='v DT5_2' data-id='DT5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Lord our God made an agreement with us in Horeb. </span>
<span class='v DT5_3' data-id='DT5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The Lord did not make this agreement with our fathers but with us, who are all living and present here today. </span>
<span class='v DT5_4' data-id='DT5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The word of the Lord came to you face to face on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire, </span>
<span class='v DT5_5' data-id='DT5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>(I was between the Lord and you at that time, to make clear to you the word of the Lord: because, through fear of the fire, you did not go up the mountain;) saying, </span>
<span class='v DT5_6' data-id='DT5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house. </span>
<span class='v DT5_7' data-id='DT5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You are to have no other gods but me. </span>
<span class='v DT5_8' data-id='DT5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You may not make for yourselves an image in the form of anything in heaven or on earth or in the waters under the earth: </span>
<span class='v DT5_9' data-id='DT5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters; </span>
<span class='v DT5_10' data-id='DT5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws. </span>
<span class='v DT5_11' data-id='DT5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged as a sinner by the Lord. </span>
<span class='v DT5_12' data-id='DT5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Keep the Sabbath day as a holy day, as you have been ordered by the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v DT5_13' data-id='DT5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>On six days do all your work: </span>
<span class='v DT5_14' data-id='DT5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day do no work, you or your son or your daughter, or your man-servant or your woman-servant, or your ox or your ass or any of your cattle, or the man from a strange country who is living among you; so that your man-servant and your woman-servant may have rest as well as you. </span>
<span class='v DT5_15' data-id='DT5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And keep in mind that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord your God took you out of that land by his strong hand and his stretched-out arm: for this reason the Lord has given you orders to keep the Sabbath day. </span>
<span class='v DT5_16' data-id='DT5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Give honour to your father and your mother, as you have been ordered by the Lord your God; so that your life may be long and all may be well for you in the land which the Lord your God is giving you. </span>
<span class='v DT5_17' data-id='DT5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Do not put anyone to death without cause. </span>
<span class='v DT5_18' data-id='DT5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Do not be false to the married relation. </span>
<span class='v DT5_19' data-id='DT5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not take the property of another. </span>
<span class='v DT5_20' data-id='DT5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Do not give false witness against your neighbour; </span>
<span class='v DT5_21' data-id='DT5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Or let your desire be turned to your neighbour's wife, or his house or his field or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is your neighbour's. </span>
<span class='v DT5_22' data-id='DT5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>These words the Lord said to all of you together on the mountain, out of the heart of the fire, out of the cloud and the dark, with a great voice: and he said no more; he put them in writing on the two stones of the law and gave them to me. </span>
<span class='v DT5_23' data-id='DT5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And after hearing the voice which came out of the dark while the mountain was burning with fire, all the heads of your tribes and your chiefs came to me, </span>
<span class='v DT5_24' data-id='DT5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And said, The Lord has let us see his glory and his power, and his voice has come to us out of the fire: today we have seen that a man may go on living even after hearing the voice of God. </span>
<span class='v DT5_25' data-id='DT5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Why then is death to be our fate? For if the voice of the Lord our God comes to us any more, death will overtake us, and we will be burned up in this great fire. </span>
<span class='v DT5_26' data-id='DT5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For what man is there in all the earth, who, hearing the voice of the living God as we have, out of the heart of the fire, has been kept from death? </span>
<span class='v DT5_27' data-id='DT5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Do you go near: and after hearing everything which the Lord our God has to say, give us an account of all he has said to you, and we will give ear, and do it. </span>
<span class='v DT5_28' data-id='DT5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord, hearing your words to me, said to me, The words which this people have said to you have come to my ears: what they have said is well said. </span>
<span class='v DT5_29' data-id='DT5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>If only they had such a heart in them at all times, so that they might go in fear of me and keep my orders and that it might be well for them and for their children for ever! </span>
<span class='v DT5_30' data-id='DT5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now say to them, Go back to your tents. </span>
<span class='v DT5_31' data-id='DT5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But as for you, keep your place here by me, and I will give you all the orders and the laws and the decisions which you are to make clear to them, so that they may do them in the land which I am giving them for their heritage. </span>
<span class='v DT5_32' data-id='DT5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Take care, then, to do whatever the Lord your God has given you orders to do; let there be no turning away to the right hand or to the left. </span>
<span class='v DT5_33' data-id='DT5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Go on walking in the way ordered for you by the Lord your God, so that life may be yours and it may be well for you, and your days may be long in the land of your heritage. </span></div></div>
