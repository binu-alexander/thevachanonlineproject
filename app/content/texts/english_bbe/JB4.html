<span class='v JB4_2' data-id='JB4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If one says a word, will it be a weariness to you? but who is able to keep from saying what is in his mind? </span>
<span class='v JB4_3' data-id='JB4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Truly, you have been a helper to others, and you have made feeble hands strong; </span>
<span class='v JB4_4' data-id='JB4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He who was near to falling has been lifted up by your words, and you have given strength to bent knees. </span>
<span class='v JB4_5' data-id='JB4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But now it has come on you and it is a weariness to you; you are touched by it and your mind is troubled. </span>
<span class='v JB4_6' data-id='JB4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Is not your fear of God your support, and your upright way of life your hope? </span>
<span class='v JB4_7' data-id='JB4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Have you ever seen destruction come to an upright man? or when were the god-fearing ever cut off? </span>
<span class='v JB4_8' data-id='JB4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>What I have seen is that those by whom trouble has been ploughed, and evil planted, get the same for themselves. </span>
<span class='v JB4_9' data-id='JB4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>By the breath of God destruction takes them, and by the wind of his wrath they are cut off. </span>
<span class='v JB4_10' data-id='JB4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Though the noise of the lion and the sounding of his voice, may be loud, the teeth of the young lions are broken. </span>
<span class='v JB4_11' data-id='JB4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The old lion comes to his end for need of food, and the young of the she-lion go wandering in all directions. </span>
<span class='v JB4_12' data-id='JB4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>A word was given to me secretly, and the low sound of it came to my ears. </span>
<span class='v JB4_13' data-id='JB4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>In troubled thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep comes on men, </span>
<span class='v JB4_14' data-id='JB4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Fear came on me and shaking, and my bones were full of trouble; </span>
<span class='v JB4_15' data-id='JB4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And a breath was moving over my face; the hair of my flesh became stiff: </span>
<span class='v JB4_16' data-id='JB4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Something was present before me, but I was not able to see it clearly; there was a form before my eyes: a quiet voice came to my ears, saying: </span>
<span class='v JB4_17' data-id='JB4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>May a man be upright before God? or a man be clean before his Maker? </span>
<span class='v JB4_18' data-id='JB4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Truly, he puts no faith in his servants, and he sees error in his angels; </span>
<span class='v JB4_19' data-id='JB4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>How much more those living in houses of earth, whose bases are in the dust! They are crushed more quickly than an insect; </span>
