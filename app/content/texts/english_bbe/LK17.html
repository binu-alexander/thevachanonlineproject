<span class='v LK17_1' data-id='LK17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to his disciples, It is necessary for causes of trouble to come about, but unhappy is he by whom they come. </span>
<span class='v LK17_2' data-id='LK17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It would be well for him if a great stone was put round his neck and he was dropped into the sea, before he made trouble for any of these little ones. </span>
<span class='v LK17_3' data-id='LK17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Give attention to yourselves: if your brother does wrong, say a sharp word to him; and if he has sorrow for his sin, let him have forgiveness. </span>
<span class='v LK17_4' data-id='LK17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And if he does you wrong seven times in a day, and seven times comes to you and says, I have regret for what I have done; let him have forgiveness. </span>
<span class='v LK17_5' data-id='LK17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the twelve said to the Lord, Make our faith greater. </span>
<span class='v LK17_6' data-id='LK17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, If your faith was only as great as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this tree, Be rooted up and planted in the sea; and it would be done. </span>
<span class='v LK17_7' data-id='LK17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But which of you, having a servant who is ploughing or keeping sheep, will say to him, when he comes in from the field, Come now and be seated and have a meal, </span>
<span class='v LK17_8' data-id='LK17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Will he not say, Get a meal for me, and make yourself ready and see to my needs till I have had my food and drink; and after that you may have yours? </span>
<span class='v LK17_9' data-id='LK17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered? </span>
<span class='v LK17_10' data-id='LK17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In the same way, when you have done all the things which are given you to do, say, There is no profit in us, for we have only done what we were ordered to do. </span>
<span class='v LK17_11' data-id='LK17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And it came about that when they were on the way to Jerusalem he went through Samaria and Galilee. </span>
<span class='v LK17_12' data-id='LK17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers, and they, keeping themselves at a distance, </span>
<span class='v LK17_13' data-id='LK17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Said, in loud voices, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. </span>
<span class='v LK17_14' data-id='LK17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And when he saw them he said, Go, and let the priests see you. And, while they were going, they were made clean. </span>
<span class='v LK17_15' data-id='LK17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And one of them, when he saw that he was clean, turning back, gave praise to God in a loud voice; </span>
<span class='v LK17_16' data-id='LK17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And, falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus, he gave the credit to him; and he was a man of Samaria. </span>
<span class='v LK17_17' data-id='LK17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, Were there not ten men who were made clean? where are the nine? </span>
<span class='v LK17_18' data-id='LK17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Have not any of them come back to give glory to God, but only this one from a strange land? </span>
<span class='v LK17_19' data-id='LK17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, Get up, and go on your way; your faith has made you well. </span>
<span class='v LK17_20' data-id='LK17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come, he gave them an answer and said, The kingdom of God will not come through observation: </span>
<span class='v LK17_21' data-id='LK17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And men will not say, See, it is here! or, There! for the kingdom of God is among you. </span>
<span class='v LK17_22' data-id='LK17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he said to his disciples, The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it. </span>
<span class='v LK17_23' data-id='LK17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And if they say to you, See, it is there! or, It is here! do not go away, or go after them. </span>
<span class='v LK17_24' data-id='LK17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of man be when his time comes. </span>
<span class='v LK17_25' data-id='LK17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But first, he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation. </span>
<span class='v LK17_26' data-id='LK17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the day of the Son of man. </span>
<span class='v LK17_27' data-id='LK17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were feasting and taking wives and getting married, till the day of the overflowing of the waters, when Noah went into the ark, and they all came to destruction. </span>
<span class='v LK17_28' data-id='LK17_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In the same way, in the days of Lot; they were feasting and trading, they were planting and building; </span>
<span class='v LK17_29' data-id='LK17_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all. </span>
<span class='v LK17_30' data-id='LK17_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man. </span>
<span class='v LK17_31' data-id='LK17_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>On that day, if anyone is on the roof of the house, and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house. </span>
<span class='v LK17_32' data-id='LK17_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Keep in mind Lot's wife. </span>
<span class='v LK17_33' data-id='LK17_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life, it will be taken from him, but if anyone gives up his life, he will keep it. </span>
<span class='v LK17_34' data-id='LK17_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>I say to you, In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed, and one will be taken away and the other let go. </span>
<span class='v LK17_35' data-id='LK17_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Two women will be crushing grain together; one will be taken away and the other let go. </span>
<span class='v LK17_36' data-id='LK17_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>[] </span>
<span class='v LK17_37' data-id='LK17_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And they, answering him, said, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there will the eagles come together. </span></div></div>
