<span class='v PR23_1' data-id='PR23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When you take your seat at the feast with a ruler, give thought with care to what is before you; </span>
<span class='v PR23_2' data-id='PR23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And put a knife to your throat, if you have a strong desire for food. </span>
<span class='v PR23_3' data-id='PR23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Have no desire for his delicate food, for it is the bread of deceit. </span>
<span class='v PR23_4' data-id='PR23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Take no care to get wealth; let there be an end to your desire for money. </span>
<span class='v PR23_5' data-id='PR23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Are your eyes lifted up to it? it is gone: for wealth takes to itself wings, like an eagle in flight up to heaven. </span>
<span class='v PR23_6' data-id='PR23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not take the food of him who has an evil eye, or have any desire for his delicate meat: </span>
<span class='v PR23_7' data-id='PR23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For as the thoughts of his heart are, so is he: Take food and drink, he says to you; but his heart is not with you. </span>
<span class='v PR23_8' data-id='PR23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The food which you have taken will come up again, and your pleasing words will be wasted. </span>
<span class='v PR23_9' data-id='PR23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Say nothing in the hearing of a foolish man, for he will put no value on the wisdom of your words. </span>
<span class='v PR23_10' data-id='PR23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Do not let the landmark of the widow be moved, and do not go into the fields of those who have no father; </span>
<span class='v PR23_11' data-id='PR23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For their saviour is strong, and he will take up their cause against you. </span>
<span class='v PR23_12' data-id='PR23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Give your heart to teaching, and your ears to the words of knowledge. </span>
<span class='v PR23_13' data-id='PR23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Do not keep back training from the child: for even if you give him blows with the rod, it will not be death to him. </span>
<span class='v PR23_14' data-id='PR23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Give him blows with the rod, and keep his soul safe from the underworld. </span>

<span class='v PR23_20' data-id='PR23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Do not be among those who give themselves to wine-drinking, or among those who make themselves full with meat: </span>
<span class='v PR23_21' data-id='PR23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For those who take delight in drink and feasting will come to be in need; and through love of sleep a man will be poorly clothed. </span>
<span class='v PR23_22' data-id='PR23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Give ear to your father whose child you are, and do not keep honour from your mother when she is old. </span>
<span class='v PR23_23' data-id='PR23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Get for yourself that which is true, and do not let it go for money; get wisdom and teaching and good sense. </span>
<span class='v PR23_24' data-id='PR23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The father of the upright man will be glad, and he who has a wise child will have joy because of him. </span>
<span class='v PR23_25' data-id='PR23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Let your father and your mother be glad, let her who gave you birth have joy. </span>
<span class='v PR23_26' data-id='PR23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes take delight in my ways. </span>
<span class='v PR23_27' data-id='PR23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For a loose woman is a deep hollow, and a strange woman is a narrow water-hole. </span>
<span class='v PR23_28' data-id='PR23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Yes, she is waiting secretly like a beast for its food, and deceit by her is increased among men. </span>
<span class='v PR23_29' data-id='PR23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Who says, Oh! who says, Ah! who has violent arguments, who has grief, who has wounds without cause, whose eyes are dark? </span>
<span class='v PR23_30' data-id='PR23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Those who are seated late over the wine: those who go looking for mixed wine. </span>
<span class='v PR23_31' data-id='PR23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Keep your eyes from looking on the wine when it is red, when its colour is bright in the cup, when it goes smoothly down: </span>
<span class='v PR23_32' data-id='PR23_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>In the end, its bite is like that of a snake, its wound like the wound of a poison-snake. </span>
<span class='v PR23_33' data-id='PR23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say twisted things. </span>
<span class='v PR23_34' data-id='PR23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Yes, you will be like him who takes his rest on the sea, or on the top of a sail-support. </span>
<span class='v PR23_35' data-id='PR23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>They have overcome me, you will say, and I have no pain; they gave me blows without my feeling them: when will I be awake from my wine? I will go after it again. </span></div></div>
