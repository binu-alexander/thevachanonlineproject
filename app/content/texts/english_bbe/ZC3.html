<span class='v ZC3_2' data-id='ZC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to the Satan, May the Lord's word be sharp against you, O Satan, the word of the Lord who has taken Jerusalem for himself: is this not a burning branch pulled out of the fire? </span>
<span class='v ZC3_3' data-id='ZC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was clothed in unclean robes, and he was in his place before the angel. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_4' data-id='ZC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he made answer and said to those who were there before him, Take the unclean robes off him, and let him be clothed in clean robes; </span>
<span class='v ZC3_5' data-id='ZC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And let them put a clean head-dress on his head. So they put a clean head-dress on his head, clothing him with clean robes: and to him he said, See, I have taken your sin away from you. </span>

<span class='v ZC3_8' data-id='ZC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Give ear now, O Joshua, the high priest, you and your friends who are seated before you; for these are men who are a sign: for see, I will let my servant the Branch be seen. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_9' data-id='ZC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For see, the stone which I have put before Joshua; on one stone are seven eyes: see, the design cut on it will be my work, says the Lord of armies, and I will take away the sin of that land in one day. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_10' data-id='ZC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In that day, says the Lord of armies, you will be one another's guests under the vine and under the fig-tree. </span></div></div>
