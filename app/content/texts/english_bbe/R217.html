<span class='v R217_2' data-id='R217_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He put forces in all the walled towns of Judah, and responsible chiefs in the land of Judah and in the towns of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. </span>
<span class='v R217_3' data-id='R217_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the Lord was with Jehoshaphat, because he went in the early ways of his father, not turning to the Baals, </span>
<span class='v R217_4' data-id='R217_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But turning to the God of his father and keeping his laws, and not doing as Israel did. </span>
<span class='v R217_5' data-id='R217_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the Lord made his kingdom strong; and all Judah gave offerings to Jehoshaphat, and he had great wealth and honour. </span>
<span class='v R217_6' data-id='R217_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>His heart was lifted up in the ways of the Lord; and he went so far as to take away the high places and the wood pillars out of Judah. </span>

<span class='v R217_9' data-id='R217_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And they gave teaching in Judah and had the book of the law of the Lord with them; they went through all the towns of Judah teaching the people. </span>
<span class='v R217_10' data-id='R217_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the fear of the Lord was on all the kingdoms of the lands round Judah, so that they made no wars against Jehoshaphat. </span>
<span class='v R217_11' data-id='R217_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And some of the Philistines took offerings to Jehoshaphat, and made him payments of silver; and the Arabians gave him flocks, seven thousand, seven hundred sheep, and seven thousand, seven hundred he-goats. </span>
