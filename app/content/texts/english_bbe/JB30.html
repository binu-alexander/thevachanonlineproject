<span class='v JB30_1' data-id='JB30_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But now those who are younger than I make sport of me; those whose fathers I would not have put with the dogs of my flocks. </span>
<span class='v JB30_2' data-id='JB30_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Of what use is the strength of their hands to me? all force is gone from them. </span>
<span class='v JB30_3' data-id='JB30_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They are wasted for need of food, biting the dry earth; their only hope of life is in the waste land. </span>
<span class='v JB30_4' data-id='JB30_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They are pulling off the salt leaves from the brushwood, and making a meal of roots. </span>
<span class='v JB30_5' data-id='JB30_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They are sent out from among their townsmen, men are crying after them as thieves </span>
<span class='v JB30_6' data-id='JB30_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They have to get a resting-place in the hollows of the valleys, in holes of the earth and rocks. </span>
<span class='v JB30_7' data-id='JB30_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They make noises like asses among the brushwood; they get together under the thorns. </span>
<span class='v JB30_8' data-id='JB30_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They are sons of shame, and of men without a name, who have been forced out of the land. </span>
<span class='v JB30_9' data-id='JB30_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And now I have become their song, and I am a word of shame to them. </span>
<span class='v JB30_10' data-id='JB30_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I am disgusting to them; they keep away from me, and put marks of shame on me. </span>
<span class='v JB30_11' data-id='JB30_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he has made loose the cord of my bow, and put me to shame; he has sent down my flag to the earth before me. </span>
<span class='v JB30_12' data-id='JB30_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The lines of his men of war put themselves in order, and make high their ways of destruction against me: </span>
<span class='v JB30_13' data-id='JB30_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They have made waste my roads, with a view to my destruction; his bowmen come round about me; </span>
<span class='v JB30_14' data-id='JB30_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>As through a wide broken place in the wall they come on, I am overturned by the shock of their attack. </span>
<span class='v JB30_15' data-id='JB30_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Fears have come on me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my well-being like a cloud. </span>
<span class='v JB30_16' data-id='JB30_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But now my soul is turned to water in me, days of trouble overtake me: </span>
<span class='v JB30_17' data-id='JB30_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The flesh is gone from my bones, and they give me no rest; there is no end to my pains. </span>
<span class='v JB30_18' data-id='JB30_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>With great force he takes a grip of my clothing, pulling me by the neck of my coat. </span>
<span class='v JB30_19' data-id='JB30_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Truly God has made me low, even to the earth, and I have become like dust. </span>
<span class='v JB30_20' data-id='JB30_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You give no answer to my cry, and take no note of my prayer. </span>
<span class='v JB30_21' data-id='JB30_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You have become cruel to me; the strength of your hand is hard on me. </span>
<span class='v JB30_22' data-id='JB30_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Lifting me up, you make me go on the wings of the wind; I am broken up by the storm. </span>
<span class='v JB30_23' data-id='JB30_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For I am certain that you will send me back to death, and to the meeting-place ordered for all living. </span>
<span class='v JB30_24' data-id='JB30_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Has not my hand been stretched out in help to the poor? have I not been a saviour to him in his trouble? </span>
<span class='v JB30_25' data-id='JB30_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Have I not been weeping for the crushed? and was not my soul sad for him who was in need? </span>
<span class='v JB30_26' data-id='JB30_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For I was looking for good, and evil came; I was waiting for light, and it became dark. </span>
<span class='v JB30_27' data-id='JB30_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>My feelings are strongly moved, and give me no rest; days of trouble have overtaken me. </span>
<span class='v JB30_28' data-id='JB30_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I go about in dark clothing, uncomforted; I get up in the public place, crying out for help. </span>
<span class='v JB30_29' data-id='JB30_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I have become a brother to the jackals, and go about in the company of ostriches. </span>
<span class='v JB30_30' data-id='JB30_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>My skin is black and dropping off me; and my bones are burning with the heat of my disease. </span>
<span class='v JB30_31' data-id='JB30_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And my music has been turned to sorrow, and the sound of my pipe into the noise of weeping. </span></div></div>
