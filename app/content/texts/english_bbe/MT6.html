<span class='v MT6_1' data-id='MT6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Take care not to do your good works before men, to be seen by them; or you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT6_2' data-id='MT6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When then you give money to the poor, do not make a noise about it, as the false-hearted men do in the Synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Truly, I say to you, They have their reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_3' data-id='MT6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But when you give money, let not your left hand see what your right hand does: </span>
<span class='v MT6_4' data-id='MT6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So that your giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_5' data-id='MT6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And when you make your prayers, be not like the false-hearted men, who take pleasure in getting up and saying their prayers in the Synagogues and at the street turnings so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_6' data-id='MT6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when you make your prayer, go into your private room, and, shutting the door, say a prayer to your Father in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_7' data-id='MT6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And in your prayer do not make use of the same words again and again, as the Gentiles do: for they have the idea that God will give attention to them because of the number of their words. </span>
<span class='v MT6_8' data-id='MT6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So be not like them; because your Father has knowledge of your needs even before you make your requests to him. </span>
<span class='v MT6_9' data-id='MT6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let this then be your prayer: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. </span>
<span class='v MT6_10' data-id='MT6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let your kingdom come. Let your pleasure be done, as in heaven, so on earth. </span>
<span class='v MT6_11' data-id='MT6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Give us this day bread for our needs. </span>
<span class='v MT6_12' data-id='MT6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And make us free of our debts, as we have made those free who are in debt to us. </span>
<span class='v MT6_13' data-id='MT6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And let us not be put to the test, but keep us safe from the Evil One. </span>
<span class='v MT6_14' data-id='MT6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For if you let men have forgiveness for their sins, you will have forgiveness from your Father in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT6_15' data-id='MT6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if you do not let men have forgiveness for their sins, you will not have forgiveness from your Father for your sins. </span>
<span class='v MT6_16' data-id='MT6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And when you go without food, be not sad-faced as the false-hearted are. For they go about with changed looks, so that men may see that they are going without food. Truly I say to you, They have their reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_17' data-id='MT6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But when you go without food, put oil on your head and make your face clean; </span>
<span class='v MT6_18' data-id='MT6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So that no one may see that you are going without food, but your Father in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will give you your reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_19' data-id='MT6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Make no store of wealth for yourselves on earth, where it may be turned to dust by worms and weather, and where thieves may come in by force and take it away. </span>
<span class='v MT6_20' data-id='MT6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But make a store for yourselves in heaven, where it will not be turned to dust and where thieves do not come in to take it away: </span>
<span class='v MT6_21' data-id='MT6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For where your wealth is, there will your heart be. </span>
<span class='v MT6_22' data-id='MT6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The light of the body is the eye; if then your eye is true, all your body will be full of light. </span>
<span class='v MT6_23' data-id='MT6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But if your eye is evil, all your body will be dark. If then the light which is in you is dark, how dark it will be! </span>
<span class='v MT6_24' data-id='MT6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>No man is able to be a servant to two masters: for he will have hate for the one and love for the other, or he will keep to one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth. </span>
<span class='v MT6_25' data-id='MT6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So I say to you, Take no thought for your life, about food or drink, or about clothing for your body. Is not life more than food, and the body more than its clothing? </span>
<span class='v MT6_26' data-id='MT6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>See the birds of heaven; they do not put seeds in the earth, they do not get in grain, or put it in store-houses; and your Father in heaven gives them food. Are you not of much more value than they? </span>
<span class='v MT6_27' data-id='MT6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And which of you by taking thought is able to make himself a cubit taller? </span>
<span class='v MT6_28' data-id='MT6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And why are you troubled about clothing? See the flowers of the field, how they come up; they do no work, they make no thread: </span>
<span class='v MT6_29' data-id='MT6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. </span>
<span class='v MT6_30' data-id='MT6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But if God gives such clothing to the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is put into the oven, will he not much more give you clothing, O you of little faith? </span>
<span class='v MT6_31' data-id='MT6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then do not be full of care, saying, What are we to have for food or drink? or, With what may we be clothed? </span>
<span class='v MT6_32' data-id='MT6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Because the Gentiles go in search of all these things: for your Father in heaven has knowledge that you have need of all these things: </span>
<span class='v MT6_33' data-id='MT6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But let your first care be for his kingdom and his righteousness; and all these other things will be given to you in addition. </span>
<span class='v MT6_34' data-id='MT6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then have no care for tomorrow: tomorrow will take care of itself. Take the trouble of the day as it comes. </span></div></div>
