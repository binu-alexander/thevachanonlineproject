<span class='v JN16_1' data-id='JN16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I have said these things to you so that you may not be in doubt. </span>
<span class='v JN16_2' data-id='JN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They will put you out of the Synagogues: yes, the time is coming when whoever puts you to death will have the belief that he is doing God's pleasure. </span>
<span class='v JN16_3' data-id='JN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They will do these things to you because they have not had knowledge of the Father or of me. </span>
<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I have said these things to you so that when the time comes, what I have said may come to your mind. I did not say them to you at the first, because then I was still with you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_5' data-id='JN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But now I am going to him who sent me; and not one of you says to me, Where are you going? </span>
<span class='v JN16_6' data-id='JN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But your hearts are full of sorrow because I have said these things. </span>
<span class='v JN16_7' data-id='JN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But what I am saying is true: my going is for your good: for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_8' data-id='JN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he, when he comes, will make the world conscious of sin, and of righteousness, and of being judged: </span>
<span class='v JN16_9' data-id='JN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Of sin, because they have not faith in me; </span>
<span class='v JN16_10' data-id='JN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Of righteousness, because I go to the Father and you will see me no more; </span>
<span class='v JN16_11' data-id='JN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Of being judged, because the ruler of this world has been judged. </span>
<span class='v JN16_12' data-id='JN16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I have still much to say to you, but you are not strong enough for it now. </span>
<span class='v JN16_13' data-id='JN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>However, when he, the Spirit of true knowledge, has come, he will be your guide into all true knowledge: for his words will not come from himself, but whatever has come to his hearing, that he will say: and he will make clear to you the things to come. </span>
<span class='v JN16_14' data-id='JN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He will give me glory, because he will take of what is mine, and make it clear to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_15' data-id='JN16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Everything which the Father has is mine: that is why I say, He will take of what is mine and will make it clear to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_16' data-id='JN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>After a little time you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me. </span>
<span class='v JN16_17' data-id='JN16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So some of the disciples said one to another, What is this he is saying, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? and, I am going to the Father? </span>
<span class='v JN16_18' data-id='JN16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So they said again and again, What is this he is saying, A little time? His words are not clear to us. </span>
<span class='v JN16_19' data-id='JN16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus saw that they had a desire to put the question to him, so he said to them, Is this what you are questioning one with another, why I said, After a little time, you will see me no longer; and then again, after a little time, you will see me? </span>
<span class='v JN16_20' data-id='JN16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Truly I say to you, You will be weeping and sorrowing, but the world will be glad: you will be sad, but your sorrow will be turned into joy. </span>
<span class='v JN16_21' data-id='JN16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When a woman is about to give birth she has sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the child, the pain is put out of her mind by the joy that a man has come into the world. </span>
<span class='v JN16_22' data-id='JN16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So you have sorrow now: but I will see you again, and your hearts will be glad, and no one will take away your joy. </span>
<span class='v JN16_23' data-id='JN16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And on that day you will put no questions to me. Truly I say to you, Whatever request you make to the Father, he will give it to you in my name. </span>
<span class='v JN16_24' data-id='JN16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Up to now you have made no request in my name: do so, and it will be answered, so that your hearts may be full of joy. </span>
<span class='v JN16_25' data-id='JN16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>All this I have said to you in veiled language: but the time is coming when I will no longer say things in veiled language but will give you knowledge of the Father clearly. </span>
<span class='v JN16_26' data-id='JN16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In that day you will make requests in my name: and I do not say that I will make prayer to the Father for you, </span>
<span class='v JN16_27' data-id='JN16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For the Father himself gives his love to you, because you have given your love to me and have had faith that I came from God. </span>
<span class='v JN16_28' data-id='JN16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I came out from the Father and have come into the world: again, I go away from the world and go to the Father. </span>
<span class='v JN16_29' data-id='JN16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>His disciples said, Now you are talking clearly and not in veiled language. </span>
<span class='v JN16_30' data-id='JN16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now we are certain that you have knowledge of all things and have no need for anyone to put questions to you: through this we have faith that you came from God. </span>
<span class='v JN16_31' data-id='JN16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus made answer, Have you faith now? </span>
<span class='v JN16_32' data-id='JN16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>See, a time is coming, yes, it is now here, when you will go away in all directions, every man to his house, and I will be by myself: but I am not by myself, because the Father is with me. </span>
<span class='v JN16_33' data-id='JN16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>I have said all these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have trouble: but take heart! I have overcome the world. </span></div></div>
