<span class='v JB8_3' data-id='JB8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Does God give wrong decisions? or is the Ruler of all not upright in his judging? </span>
<span class='v JB8_4' data-id='JB8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If your children have done evil against him, then their punishment is from his hand. </span>
<span class='v JB8_5' data-id='JB8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If you will make search for God with care, and put your request before the Ruler of all; </span>
<span class='v JB8_6' data-id='JB8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If you are clean and upright; then he will certainly be moved to take up your cause, and will make clear your righteousness by building up your house again. </span>
