<span class='v EC3_1' data-id='EC3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For everything there is a fixed time, and a time for every business under the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC3_2' data-id='EC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A time for birth and a time for death; a time for planting and a time for uprooting; </span>
<span class='v EC3_3' data-id='EC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>A time to put to death and a time to make well; a time for pulling down and a time for building up; </span>
<span class='v EC3_4' data-id='EC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>A time for weeping and a time for laughing; a time for sorrow and a time for dancing; </span>
<span class='v EC3_5' data-id='EC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>A time to take stones away and a time to get stones together; a time for kissing and a time to keep from kissing; </span>
<span class='v EC3_6' data-id='EC3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>A time for search and a time for loss; a time to keep and a time to give away; </span>
<span class='v EC3_7' data-id='EC3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A time for undoing and a time for stitching; a time for keeping quiet and a time for talk; </span>
<span class='v EC3_8' data-id='EC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>A time for love and a time for hate; a time for war and a time for peace. </span>
<span class='v EC3_9' data-id='EC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What profit has the worker in the work which he does? </span>
<span class='v EC3_10' data-id='EC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I saw the work which God has put on the sons of man. </span>
<span class='v EC3_11' data-id='EC3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He has made everything right in its time; but he has made their hearts without knowledge, so that man is unable to see the works of God, from the first to the last. </span>
<span class='v EC3_12' data-id='EC3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I am certain that there is nothing better for a man than to be glad, and to do good while life is in him. </span>
<span class='v EC3_13' data-id='EC3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And for every man to take food and drink, and have joy in all his work, is a reward from God. </span>
<span class='v EC3_14' data-id='EC3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am certain that whatever God does will be for ever. No addition may be made to it, nothing may be taken from it; and God has done it so that man may be in fear before him. </span>
<span class='v EC3_15' data-id='EC3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whatever is has been before, and what is to be is now; because God makes search for the things which are past. </span>
<span class='v EC3_16' data-id='EC3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And again, I saw under the sun, in the place of the judges, that evil was there; and in the place of righteousness, that evil was there. </span>
<span class='v EC3_17' data-id='EC3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, God will be judge of the good and of the bad; because a time for every purpose and for every work has been fixed by him. </span>
<span class='v EC3_18' data-id='EC3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, so that God may put them to the test and that they may see themselves as beasts. </span>
<span class='v EC3_19' data-id='EC3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Because the fate of the sons of men and the fate of the beasts is the same. As is the death of one so is the death of the other, and all have one spirit. Man is not higher than the beasts; because all is to no purpose. </span>
<span class='v EC3_20' data-id='EC3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>All go to one place, all are of the dust, and all will be turned to dust again. </span>
<span class='v EC3_21' data-id='EC3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Who is certain that the spirit of the sons of men goes up to heaven, or that the spirit of the beasts goes down to the earth? </span>
<span class='v EC3_22' data-id='EC3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So I saw that there is nothing better than for a man to have joy in his work — because that is his reward. Who will make him see what will come after him? </span></div></div>
