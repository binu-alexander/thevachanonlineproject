<span class='v LV25_2' data-id='LV25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Say to the children of Israel, When you come into the land which I will give you, let the land keep a Sabbath to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LV25_3' data-id='LV25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For six years put seed into your land, and for six years give care to your vines and get in the produce of them; </span>
<span class='v LV25_4' data-id='LV25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But let the seventh year be a Sabbath of rest for the land, a Sabbath to the Lord; do not put seed into your land or have your vines cut. </span>
<span class='v LV25_5' data-id='LV25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>That which comes to growth of itself may not be cut, and the grapes of your uncared-for vines may not be taken off; let it be a year of rest for the land. </span>
<span class='v LV25_6' data-id='LV25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Sabbath of the land will give food for you and your man-servant and your woman-servant and those working for payment, and for those of another country who are living among you; </span>
<span class='v LV25_7' data-id='LV25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And for your cattle and the beasts on the land; all the natural increase of the land will be for food. </span>
<span class='v LV25_8' data-id='LV25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And let seven Sabbaths of years be numbered to you, seven times seven years; even the days of seven Sabbaths of years, that is forty-nine years; </span>
<span class='v LV25_9' data-id='LV25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then let the loud horn be sounded far and wide on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of taking away sin let the horn be sounded through all your land. </span>
<span class='v LV25_10' data-id='LV25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And let this fiftieth year be kept holy, and say publicly that everyone in the land is free from debt: it is the Jubilee, and every man may go back to his heritage and to his family. </span>
<span class='v LV25_11' data-id='LV25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let this fiftieth year be the Jubilee: no seed may be planted, and that which comes to growth of itself may not be cut, and the grapes may not be taken from the uncared-for vines. </span>
<span class='v LV25_12' data-id='LV25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For it is the Jubilee, and it is holy to you; your food will be the natural increase of the field. </span>
<span class='v LV25_13' data-id='LV25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>In this year of Jubilee, let every man go back to his heritage. </span>
<span class='v LV25_14' data-id='LV25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And in the business of trading goods for money, do no wrong to one another. </span>
<span class='v LV25_15' data-id='LV25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let your exchange of goods with your neighbours have relation to the number of years after the year of Jubilee, and the number of times the earth has given her produce. </span>
<span class='v LV25_16' data-id='LV25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the number of years is great, the price will be increased, and if the number of years is small, the price will be less, for it is the produce of a certain number of years which the man is giving you. </span>
<span class='v LV25_17' data-id='LV25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And do no wrong, one to another, but let the fear of your God be before you; for I am the Lord your God. </span>

<span class='v LV25_21' data-id='LV25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I will send my blessing on you in the sixth year, and the land will give fruit enough for three years. </span>
<span class='v LV25_22' data-id='LV25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And in the eighth year you will put in your seed, and get your food from the old stores, till the fruit of the ninth year is ready. </span>
<span class='v LV25_23' data-id='LV25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>No exchange of land may be for ever, for the land is mine, and you are as my guests, living with me for a time. </span>
<span class='v LV25_24' data-id='LV25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Wherever there is property in land, the owner is to have the right of getting it back. </span>
<span class='v LV25_25' data-id='LV25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>If your brother becomes poor, and has to give up some of his land for money, his nearest relation may come and get back that which his brother has given up. </span>
<span class='v LV25_26' data-id='LV25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And if he has no one to get it back for him, and later he himself gets wealth and has enough money to get it back; </span>
<span class='v LV25_27' data-id='LV25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then let him take into account the years from the time when he gave it up, and make up the loss for the rest of the years to him who took it, and so get back his property. </span>
<span class='v LV25_28' data-id='LV25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then it will be kept by him who gave a price for it, till the year of Jubilee; and in that year it will go back to its first owner and he will have his property again. </span>
<span class='v LV25_29' data-id='LV25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And if a man gives his house in a walled town for money, he has the right to get it back for the space of a full year after he has given it up. </span>
<span class='v LV25_30' data-id='LV25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And if he does not get it back by the end of the year, then the house in the town will become the property of him who gave the money for it, and of his children for ever; it will not go from him in the year of Jubilee. </span>
<span class='v LV25_31' data-id='LV25_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But houses in small unwalled towns will be the same as property in the country; they may be got back, and they will go back to their owners in the year of Jubilee. </span>
<span class='v LV25_32' data-id='LV25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But the houses in the towns of the Levites may be got back by the Levites at any time. </span>
<span class='v LV25_33' data-id='LV25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And if a Levite does not give money to get back his property, his house in the town which was exchanged for money will come back to him in the year of Jubilee. For the houses of the towns of the Levites are their property among the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v LV25_34' data-id='LV25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But the land on the outskirts of their towns may not be exchanged for money, for it is their property for ever. </span>
<span class='v LV25_35' data-id='LV25_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And if your brother becomes poor and is not able to make a living, then you are to keep him with you, helping him as you would a man from another country who is living among you. </span>
<span class='v LV25_36' data-id='LV25_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Take no interest from him, in money or in goods, but have the fear of your God before you, and let your brother make a living among you. </span>
<span class='v LV25_37' data-id='LV25_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Do not take interest on the money which you let him have or on the food which you give him. </span>
<span class='v LV25_38' data-id='LV25_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>I am the Lord your God, who took you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, that I might be your God. </span>
<span class='v LV25_39' data-id='LV25_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And if your brother becomes poor and gives himself to you for money, do not make use of him like a servant who is your property; </span>
<span class='v LV25_40' data-id='LV25_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But let him be with you as a servant working for payment, till the year of Jubilee; </span>
<span class='v LV25_41' data-id='LV25_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then he will go out from you, he and his children with him, and go back to his family and to the property of his fathers. </span>
<span class='v LV25_42' data-id='LV25_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For they are my servants whom I took out from the land of Egypt; they may not become the property of another. </span>
<span class='v LV25_43' data-id='LV25_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Do not be a hard master to him, but have the fear of God before you. </span>
<span class='v LV25_44' data-id='LV25_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>But you may get servants as property from among the nations round about; from them you may take men-servants and women-servants. </span>
<span class='v LV25_45' data-id='LV25_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And in addition, you may get, for money, servants from among the children of other nations who are living with you, and from their families which have come to birth in your land; and these will be your property. </span>
<span class='v LV25_46' data-id='LV25_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And they will be your children's heritage after you, to keep as their property; they will be your servants for ever; but you may not be hard masters to your countrymen, the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v LV25_47' data-id='LV25_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And if one from another nation living among you gets wealth, and your countryman, at his side, becomes poor and gives himself for money to the man from another nation or to one of his family; </span>
<span class='v LV25_48' data-id='LV25_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>After he has given himself he has the right to be made free, for a price, by one of his brothers, </span>
<span class='v LV25_49' data-id='LV25_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Or his father's brother, or the son of his father's brother, or any near relation; or if he gets money, he may make himself free. </span>
<span class='v LV25_50' data-id='LV25_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And let the years be numbered from the time when he gave himself to his owner till the year of Jubilee, and the price given for him will be in relation to the number of years, on the scale of the payment of a servant. </span>
<span class='v LV25_51' data-id='LV25_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>If there is still a long time, he will give back, on account of it, a part of the price which was given for him. </span>
<span class='v LV25_52' data-id='LV25_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And if there is only a short time, he will take account of it with his master, and in relation to the number of years he will give back the price of making him free. </span>
<span class='v LV25_53' data-id='LV25_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And he will be with him as a servant working for payment year by year; his master is not to be cruel to him before your eyes. </span>
<span class='v LV25_54' data-id='LV25_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>And if he is not made free in this way, he will go out in the year of Jubilee, he and his children with him. </span>
<span class='v LV25_55' data-id='LV25_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>For the children of Israel are servants to me; they are my servants whom I took out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. </span></div></div>
