<span class='v IS48_1' data-id='IS48_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear to this, O family of Jacob, you who are named by the name of Israel, and have come out of the body of Judah; who take oaths by the name of the Lord, and make use of the name of the God of Israel, but not truly and not in good faith. </span>
<span class='v IS48_2' data-id='IS48_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For they say that they are of the holy town, and put their faith in the God of Israel: the Lord of armies is his name. </span>
<span class='v IS48_3' data-id='IS48_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I gave word in the past of the things which came about; they came from my mouth, and I made them clear: suddenly I did them, and they came about. </span>
<span class='v IS48_4' data-id='IS48_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because I saw that your heart was hard, and that your neck was an iron cord, and your brow brass; </span>
<span class='v IS48_5' data-id='IS48_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this reason I made it clear to you in the past, before it came I gave you word of it: for fear that you might say, My god did these things, and my pictured and metal images made them come about. </span>
<span class='v IS48_6' data-id='IS48_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>All this has come to your ears and you have seen it; will you not give witness to it? I am now making clear new things, even secret things, of which you had no knowledge. </span>
<span class='v IS48_7' data-id='IS48_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They have only now been effected, and not in the past: and before this day they had not come to your ears; for fear that you might say, I had knowledge of them. </span>
<span class='v IS48_8' data-id='IS48_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Truly you had no word of them, no knowledge of them; no news of them in the past had come to your ears; because I saw how false was your behaviour, and that your heart was turned against me from your earliest days. </span>
<span class='v IS48_9' data-id='IS48_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Because of my name I will put away my wrath, and for my praise I will keep myself from cutting you off. </span>
<span class='v IS48_10' data-id='IS48_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>See, I have been testing you for myself like silver; I have put you through the fire of trouble. </span>
<span class='v IS48_11' data-id='IS48_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For myself, even because of my name, I will do it; for I will not let my name be shamed; and my glory I will not give to another. </span>
<span class='v IS48_12' data-id='IS48_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Give ear to me, Jacob, and Israel, my loved one; I am he, I am the first and I am the last. </span>
<span class='v IS48_13' data-id='IS48_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Yes, by my hand was the earth placed on its base, and by my right hand the heavens were stretched out; at my word they take up their places. </span>
<span class='v IS48_14' data-id='IS48_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Come together, all of you, and give ear; who among you has given news of these things? the Lord's loved one will do his pleasure with Babylon, and with the seed of the Chaldaeans. </span>
<span class='v IS48_15' data-id='IS48_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I, even I, have given the word; I have sent for him: I have made him come, and have given effect to his undertakings. </span>
<span class='v IS48_16' data-id='IS48_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Come near to me, and give ear to this; from the start I did not keep it secret; from the time of its coming into existence I was there: and now the Lord God has sent me, and given me his spirit. </span>
<span class='v IS48_17' data-id='IS48_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The Lord who takes up your cause, the Holy One of Israel, says, I am the Lord your God, who is teaching you for your profit, guiding you by the way in which you are to go. </span>
<span class='v IS48_18' data-id='IS48_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If only you had given ear to my orders, then your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea: </span>
<span class='v IS48_19' data-id='IS48_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Your seed would have been like the sand, and your offspring like the dust: your name would not be cut off or come to an end before me. </span>
<span class='v IS48_20' data-id='IS48_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Go out of Babylon, go in flight from the Chaldaeans; with the sound of song make it clear, give the news, let the word go out even to the end of the earth: say, The Lord has taken up the cause of his servant Jacob. </span>
<span class='v IS48_21' data-id='IS48_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They had no need of water when he was guiding them through the waste lands: he made water come out of the rock for them: the rock was parted and the waters came flowing out. </span>
<span class='v IS48_22' data-id='IS48_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>There is no peace, says the Lord, for the evil-doers. </span></div></div>
