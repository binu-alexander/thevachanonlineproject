<span class='v HS8_1' data-id='HS8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Put the horn to your mouth. He comes like an eagle against the house of the Lord; because they have gone against my agreement, they have not kept my law. </span>
<span class='v HS8_2' data-id='HS8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They will send up to me a cry for help: We, Israel, have knowledge of you, O God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v HS8_3' data-id='HS8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Israel has given up what is good; his haters will go after him. </span>
<span class='v HS8_4' data-id='HS8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They have put up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, but I had no knowledge of it; they have made images of silver and gold, so that they may be cut off. </span>
<span class='v HS8_5' data-id='HS8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will have nothing to do with your young ox, O Samaria; my wrath is burning against them; how long will it be before the children of Israel make themselves clean? </span>
<span class='v HS8_6' data-id='HS8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The workman made it, it is no god; the ox of Samaria will be broken into bits. </span>
<span class='v HS8_7' data-id='HS8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For they have been planting the wind, and their fruit will be the storm; his grain has no stem, it will give no meal, and if it does, a strange nation will take it. </span>
<span class='v HS8_8' data-id='HS8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Israel has come to destruction; now they are among the nations like a cup in which there is no pleasure. </span>
<span class='v HS8_9' data-id='HS8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For they have gone up to Assyria like an ass going by himself; Ephraim has given money to get lovers. </span>
<span class='v HS8_10' data-id='HS8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But though they give money to the nations for help, still I will send them in all directions; and in a short time they will be without a king and rulers. </span>
<span class='v HS8_11' data-id='HS8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Because Ephraim has been increasing altars for sin, altars have become a cause of sin to him. </span>
<span class='v HS8_12' data-id='HS8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Though I put my law in writing for him in ten thousand rules, they are to him as a strange thing. </span>
<span class='v HS8_13' data-id='HS8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He gives the offerings of his lovers, and takes the flesh for food; but the Lord has no pleasure in them; now he will keep in mind their evil-doing and give them the punishment of their sins; they will go back to Egypt. </span>
<span class='v HS8_14' data-id='HS8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For Israel has no memory of his Maker, and has put up the houses of kings; and Judah has made great the number of his walled towns. But I will send a fire on his towns and put an end to his great houses. </span></div></div>
