<span class='v PS79_1' data-id='PS79_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>O God, the nations have come into your heritage; they have made your holy Temple unclean; they have made Jerusalem a mass of broken walls. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_2' data-id='PS79_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They have given the bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air, and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_3' data-id='PS79_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Their blood has been flowing like water round about Jerusalem; there was no one to put them in their last resting-place. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_4' data-id='PS79_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>We are looked down on by our neighbours, we are laughed at and made sport of by those who are round us. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_5' data-id='PS79_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>How long, O Lord? will you be angry for ever? will your wrath go on burning like fire? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_6' data-id='PS79_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let your wrath be on the nations who have no knowledge of you, and on the kingdoms who have not made prayer to your name. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_7' data-id='PS79_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For they have taken Jacob for their meat, and made waste his house. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_8' data-id='PS79_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Do not keep in mind against us the sins of our fathers; let your mercy come to us quickly, for we have been made very low. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_9' data-id='PS79_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Give us help, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your name; take us out of danger and give us forgiveness for our sins, because of your name. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_10' data-id='PS79_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Why may the nations say, Where is their God? Let payment for the blood of your servants be made openly among the nations before our eyes. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS79_11' data-id='PS79_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let the cry of the prisoner come before you; with your strong arm make free the children of death; </span></div>
