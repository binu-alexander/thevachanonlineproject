<span class='v AC10_1' data-id='AC10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a certain man in Caesarea, named Cornelius, the captain of the Italian band of the army; </span>
<span class='v AC10_2' data-id='AC10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A serious-minded man, fearing God with all his family; he gave much money to the poor, and made prayer to God at all times. </span>
<span class='v AC10_3' data-id='AC10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He saw in a vision, clearly, at about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of the Lord coming to him and saying to him, Cornelius! </span>
<span class='v AC10_4' data-id='AC10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he, looking on him in fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your offerings have come up to God, and he has kept them in mind. </span>
<span class='v AC10_5' data-id='AC10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now send men to Joppa, and get one Simon, named Peter, </span>
<span class='v AC10_6' data-id='AC10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who is living with Simon, a leather-worker, whose house is by the sea. </span>
<span class='v AC10_7' data-id='AC10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when the angel who said these words to him had gone away, he sent for two of his house-servants, and a God-fearing man of the army, one of those who were waiting on him at all times; </span>
<span class='v AC10_8' data-id='AC10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And having given them an account of everything, he sent them to Joppa. </span>
<span class='v AC10_9' data-id='AC10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now the day after, when they were on their journey and were near the town, Peter went up to the top of the house for prayer, about the sixth hour: </span>
<span class='v AC10_10' data-id='AC10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he was in need of food: but while they were getting it ready, a deep sleep came on him; </span>
<span class='v AC10_11' data-id='AC10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he saw the heavens opening, and a vessel coming down, like a great cloth let down on the earth, </span>
<span class='v AC10_12' data-id='AC10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In which were all sorts of beasts and birds. </span>
<span class='v AC10_13' data-id='AC10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And a voice came to him, saying, Come, Peter; take them for food. </span>
<span class='v AC10_14' data-id='AC10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, No, Lord; for I have never taken food which is common or unclean. </span>
<span class='v AC10_15' data-id='AC10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the voice came to him a second time, What God has made clean, do not you make common. </span>
<span class='v AC10_16' data-id='AC10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And this was done three times: and then the vessel was taken back into heaven. </span>
<span class='v AC10_17' data-id='AC10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now while Peter was in doubt as to the purpose of this vision, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made search for Simon's house, came to the door, </span>
<span class='v AC10_18' data-id='AC10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>To see if Simon, named Peter, was living there. </span>
<span class='v AC10_19' data-id='AC10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And, while Peter was turning the vision over in his mind, the Spirit said to him, See, three men are looking for you. </span>
<span class='v AC10_20' data-id='AC10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Go down, then, and go with them, doubting nothing, for I have sent them. </span>
<span class='v AC10_21' data-id='AC10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Peter went down to the men, and said, I am the man you are looking for: why have you come? </span>
<span class='v AC10_22' data-id='AC10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they said, Cornelius, a captain, an upright and God-fearing man, respected by all the nation of the Jews, had word from God by an angel to send for you to his house, and to give hearing to your words. </span>
<span class='v AC10_23' data-id='AC10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So he took them in for the night. And the day after, he went with them, taking some of the brothers from Joppa with him. </span>
<span class='v AC10_24' data-id='AC10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the day after that, they came to Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having got together his relations and his near friends. </span>
<span class='v AC10_25' data-id='AC10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And when Peter came in, Cornelius came to him and, falling down at his feet, gave him worship. </span>
<span class='v AC10_26' data-id='AC10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Peter, lifting him up, said, Get up, for I am a man as you are. </span>
<span class='v AC10_27' data-id='AC10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And saying these words, he went in, and saw that a great number of people had come together; </span>
<span class='v AC10_28' data-id='AC10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, You yourselves have knowledge that it is against the law for a man who is a Jew to be in the company of one who is of another nation; but God has made it clear to me that no man may be named common or unclean: </span>
<span class='v AC10_29' data-id='AC10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And so I came without question, when I was sent for. What then is your purpose in sending for me? </span>
<span class='v AC10_30' data-id='AC10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Cornelius said, Four days from now I was in my house in prayer at the ninth hour; and I saw before me a man in shining clothing, </span>
<span class='v AC10_31' data-id='AC10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Who said, Cornelius, your prayer has come to the ears of God, and your offerings are kept in his memory. </span>
<span class='v AC10_32' data-id='AC10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Send, then, to Joppa, and get Simon, named Peter, to come to you; he is living in the house of Simon, a leather-worker, by the sea. </span>
<span class='v AC10_33' data-id='AC10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So, straight away, I sent for you; and you have done well to come. And now, we are all present before God, ready to give attention to all the things which the Lord has given you to say. </span>
<span class='v AC10_34' data-id='AC10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then Peter said, Truly, I see clearly that God is no respecter of persons: </span>
<span class='v AC10_35' data-id='AC10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But in every nation, the man who has fear of him and does righteousness is pleasing to him. </span>
<span class='v AC10_36' data-id='AC10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The word which he sent to the children of Israel, giving the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (who is Lord of all) — </span>
<span class='v AC10_37' data-id='AC10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>That word you yourselves have knowledge of, which was made public through all Judaea, starting from Galilee, after the baptism of which John was the preacher, </span>
<span class='v AC10_38' data-id='AC10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>About Jesus of Nazareth, how God gave the Holy Spirit to him, with power: and how he went about doing good and making well all who were troubled by evil spirits, for God was with him. </span>
<span class='v AC10_39' data-id='AC10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And we are witnesses of all the things which he did in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they put to death, hanging him on a tree. </span>
<span class='v AC10_40' data-id='AC10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>On the third day God gave him back to life, and let him be seen, </span>
<span class='v AC10_41' data-id='AC10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Not by all the people, but by witnesses marked out before by God, even by us, who took food and drink with him after he came back from the dead. </span>
<span class='v AC10_42' data-id='AC10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And he gave us orders to give news of this to the people, and to give public witness that this is he whom God has made judge of the living and the dead. </span>
<span class='v AC10_43' data-id='AC10_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>To him all the prophets give witness, that through his name everyone who has faith in him will have forgiveness of sins. </span>
<span class='v AC10_44' data-id='AC10_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>While Peter was saying these words, the Holy Spirit came on all those who were hearing the word. </span>
<span class='v AC10_45' data-id='AC10_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And the Jews of the faith, who had come with Peter, were full of wonder, because the Holy Spirit was given to the Gentiles, </span>
<span class='v AC10_46' data-id='AC10_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And they were talking in tongues, and giving glory to God. Then Peter said, </span>
<span class='v AC10_47' data-id='AC10_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Will any man say that these may not have baptism who have been given the Holy Spirit as we have? </span>
<span class='v AC10_48' data-id='AC10_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And he gave orders for them to have baptism in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they kept him with them for some days. </span></div></div>
