<span class='v JR18_1' data-id='JR18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR18_2' data-id='JR18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Up! go down to the potter's house, and there I will let my words come to your ears. </span>
<span class='v JR18_3' data-id='JR18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then I went down to the potter's house, and he was doing his work on the stones. </span>
<span class='v JR18_4' data-id='JR18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when the vessel, which he was forming out of earth, got damaged in the hand of the potter, he made it again into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make it. </span>
<span class='v JR18_5' data-id='JR18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR18_6' data-id='JR18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>O Israel, am I not able to do with you as this potter does? says the Lord. See, like earth in the potter's hand are you in my hands, O Israel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_7' data-id='JR18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Whenever I say anything about uprooting a nation or a kingdom, and smashing it and sending destruction on it; </span>
<span class='v JR18_8' data-id='JR18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If, in that very minute, that nation of which I was talking is turned away from its evil, my purpose of doing evil to them will be changed. </span>
<span class='v JR18_9' data-id='JR18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And whenever I say anything about building up a nation or a kingdom, and planting it; </span>
<span class='v JR18_10' data-id='JR18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If, in that very minute, it does evil in my eyes, going against my orders, then my good purpose, which I said I would do for them, will be changed. </span>
<span class='v JR18_11' data-id='JR18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now, then, say to the men of Judah and to the people of Jerusalem, This is what the Lord has said: See, I am forming an evil thing against you, and designing a design against you: let every man come back now from his evil way, and let your ways and your doings be changed for the better. </span>
<span class='v JR18_12' data-id='JR18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But they will say, There is no hope: we will go on in our designs, and every one of us will do what he is moved by the pride of his evil heart to do. </span>
<span class='v JR18_13' data-id='JR18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So this is what the Lord has said: Make search among the nations and see who has had word of such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very shocking thing. </span>
<span class='v JR18_14' data-id='JR18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Will the white snow go away from the top of Sirion? will the cold waters flowing from the mountains become dry? </span>
<span class='v JR18_15' data-id='JR18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For my people have put me out of their memory, burning perfumes to that which is nothing; and because of this, I will put a cause of falling in their ways, even in the old roads, and will make them go on side-roads, in a way not lifted up; </span>
<span class='v JR18_16' data-id='JR18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Making their land a thing of wonder, causing sounds of surprise for ever; everyone who goes by will be overcome with wonder, shaking his head. </span>
<span class='v JR18_17' data-id='JR18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will send them in flight, as from an east wind, before the attacker; I will let them see my back and not my face on the day of their downfall. </span>
<span class='v JR18_18' data-id='JR18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then they said, Come, let us make a design against Jeremiah; for teaching will never be cut off from the priest, or wisdom from the wise, or the word from the prophet. Come, let us make use of his words for an attack on him, and let us give attention with care to what he says. </span>
<span class='v JR18_19' data-id='JR18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Give thought to me, O Lord, and give ear to the voice of those who put forward a cause against me. </span>
<span class='v JR18_20' data-id='JR18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Is evil to be the reward of good? for they have made a deep hole for my soul. Keep in mind how I took my place before you, to say a good word for them so that your wrath might be turned away from them. </span>
<span class='v JR18_21' data-id='JR18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For this cause, let their children be without food, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives be without children and become widows; let their men be overtaken by death, and their young men be put to the sword in the fight. </span>
<span class='v JR18_22' data-id='JR18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Let a cry for help go up from their houses, when you send an armed band on them suddenly: for they have made a hole in which to take me, and have put nets for my feet secretly. </span>
<span class='v JR18_23' data-id='JR18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But you, Lord, have knowledge of all the designs which they have made against my life; let not their evil-doing be covered or their sin be washed away from before your eyes: but let it be a cause of falling before you: so do to them in the time of your wrath. </span></div></div>
