<span class='v MT7_1' data-id='MT7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Be not judges of others, and you will not be judged. </span>
<span class='v MT7_2' data-id='MT7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For as you have been judging, so you will be judged, and with your measure will it be measured to you. </span>
<span class='v MT7_3' data-id='MT7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And why do you take note of the grain of dust in your brother's eye, but take no note of the bit of wood which is in your eye? </span>
<span class='v MT7_4' data-id='MT7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or how will you say to your brother, Let me take out the grain of dust from your eye, when you yourself have a bit of wood in your eye? </span>
<span class='v MT7_5' data-id='MT7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You false one, first take out the bit of wood from your eye, then will you see clearly to take out the grain of dust from your brother's eye. </span>
<span class='v MT7_6' data-id='MT7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not give that which is holy to the dogs, or put your jewels before pigs, for fear that they will be crushed under foot by the pigs whose attack will then be made against you. </span>
<span class='v MT7_7' data-id='MT7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Make a request, and it will be answered; what you are searching for you will get; give the sign, and the door will be open to you: </span>
<span class='v MT7_8' data-id='MT7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Because to everyone who makes a request, it will be given; and he who is searching will get his desire, and to him who gives the sign, the door will be open. </span>
<span class='v MT7_9' data-id='MT7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Or which of you, if his son makes a request for bread, will give him a stone? </span>
<span class='v MT7_10' data-id='MT7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Or if he makes a request for a fish, will give him a snake? </span>
<span class='v MT7_11' data-id='MT7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If you, then, being evil, are able to give good things to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who make requests to him? </span>
<span class='v MT7_12' data-id='MT7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All those things, then, which you would have men do to you, even so do you to them: because this is the law and the prophets. </span>
<span class='v MT7_13' data-id='MT7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Go in by the narrow door; for wide is the door and open is the way which goes to destruction, and great numbers go in by it. </span>
<span class='v MT7_14' data-id='MT7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For narrow is the door and hard the road to life, and only a small number make discovery of it. </span>
<span class='v MT7_15' data-id='MT7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Be on the watch for false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inside they are cruel wolves. </span>
<span class='v MT7_16' data-id='MT7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>By their fruits you will get knowledge of them. Do men get grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? </span>
<span class='v MT7_17' data-id='MT7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Even so, every good tree gives good fruit; but the bad tree gives evil fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT7_18' data-id='MT7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is not possible for a good tree to give bad fruit, and a bad tree will not give good fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT7_19' data-id='MT7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Every tree which does not give good fruit is cut down and put in the fire. </span>
<span class='v MT7_20' data-id='MT7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So by their fruits you will get knowledge of them. </span>
<span class='v MT7_21' data-id='MT7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will go into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the pleasure of my Father in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT7_22' data-id='MT7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>A great number will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, were we not prophets in your name, and did we not by your name send out evil spirits, and by your name do works of power? </span>
<span class='v MT7_23' data-id='MT7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And then will I say to them, I never had knowledge of you: go from me, you workers of evil. </span>
<span class='v MT7_24' data-id='MT7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Everyone, then, to whom my words come and who does them, will be like a wise man who made his house on a rock; </span>
<span class='v MT7_25' data-id='MT7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house, but it was not moved; because it was based on the rock. </span>
<span class='v MT7_26' data-id='MT7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And everyone to whom my words come and who does them not, will be like a foolish man who made his house on sand; </span>
<span class='v MT7_27' data-id='MT7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the rain came down and there was a rush of waters and the winds were driving against that house; and it came down and great was its fall. </span>
<span class='v MT7_28' data-id='MT7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And it came about, when Jesus had come to the end of these words, that the people were surprised at his teaching, </span>
<span class='v MT7_29' data-id='MT7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>for he was teaching as one having authority, and not as their scribes. </span></div></div>
