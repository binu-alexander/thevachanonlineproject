<span class='v JR10_1' data-id='JR10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear to the word which the Lord says to you, O people of Israel: </span>
<span class='v JR10_2' data-id='JR10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord has said: Do not go in the way of the nations; have no fear of the signs of heaven, for the nations go in fear of them. </span>
<span class='v JR10_3' data-id='JR10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For that which is feared by the people is foolish: it is the work of the hands of the workman; for a tree is cut down by him out of the woods with his axe. </span>
<span class='v JR10_4' data-id='JR10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They make it beautiful with silver and gold; they make it strong with nails and hammers, so that it may not be moved. </span>
<span class='v JR10_5' data-id='JR10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is like a pillar in a garden of plants, and has no voice: it has to be lifted, for it has no power of walking. Have no fear of it; for it has no power of doing evil and it is not able to do any good. </span>
<span class='v JR10_6' data-id='JR10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There is no one like you, O Lord; you are great and your name is great in power. </span>
<span class='v JR10_7' data-id='JR10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who would not have fear of you, O King of the nations? for it is your right: for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is no one like you. </span>
<span class='v JR10_8' data-id='JR10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But they are together like beasts and foolish: the teaching of false gods is wood. </span>
<span class='v JR10_9' data-id='JR10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Silver hammered into plates is sent from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the expert workman and of the hands of the gold-worker; blue and purple is their clothing, all the work of expert men. </span>
<span class='v JR10_10' data-id='JR10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God and an eternal king: when he is angry, the earth is shaking with fear, and the nations give way before his wrath. </span>
<span class='v JR10_11' data-id='JR10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This is what you are to say to them: The gods who have not made the heavens and the earth will be cut off from the earth and from under the heavens. </span>
<span class='v JR10_12' data-id='JR10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He has made the earth by his power, he has made the world strong in its place by his wisdom, and by his wise design the heavens have been stretched out. </span>
<span class='v JR10_13' data-id='JR10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>At the sound of his voice there is a massing of waters in the heavens, and he makes the mists go up from the ends of the earth; he makes the thunder-flames for the rain, and sends out the wind from his store-houses. </span>
<span class='v JR10_14' data-id='JR10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then every man becomes like a beast without knowledge; every gold-worker is put to shame by the image he has made: for his metal image is deceit, and there is no breath in them. </span>
<span class='v JR10_15' data-id='JR10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They are nothing, a work of error: in the time of their punishment, destruction will overtake them. </span>
<span class='v JR10_16' data-id='JR10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The heritage of Jacob is not like these; for the maker of all things is his heritage: the Lord of armies is his name. </span>
<span class='v JR10_17' data-id='JR10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Get your goods together and go out of the land, O you who are shut up in the walled town. </span>
<span class='v JR10_18' data-id='JR10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For the Lord has said, I will send the people in flight like a stone from the land at this time, troubling them so that they will be conscious of it. </span>
<span class='v JR10_19' data-id='JR10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Sorrow is mine for I am wounded! my wound may not be made well; and I said, Cruel is my disease, I may not be free from it. </span>
<span class='v JR10_20' data-id='JR10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>My tent is pulled down and all my cords are broken: my children have gone from me, and they are not: no longer is there anyone to give help in stretching out my tent and hanging up my curtains. </span>
<span class='v JR10_21' data-id='JR10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For the keepers of the sheep have become like beasts, not looking to the Lord for directions: so they have not done wisely and all their flocks have been put to flight. </span>
<span class='v JR10_22' data-id='JR10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>News is going about, see, it is coming, a great shaking is coming from the north country, so that the towns of Judah may be made waste and become the living-place of jackals. </span>
<span class='v JR10_23' data-id='JR10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>O Lord, I am conscious that a man's way is not in himself: man has no power of guiding his steps. </span>
<span class='v JR10_24' data-id='JR10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>O Lord, put me right, but with wise purpose; not in your wrath, or you will make me small. </span>
<span class='v JR10_25' data-id='JR10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Let your wrath be let loose on the nations which have no knowledge of you, and on the families who give no worship to your name: for they have made a meal of Jacob, truly they have made a meal of him and put an end to him and made his fields a waste. </span></div></div>
