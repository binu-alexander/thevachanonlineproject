<span class='v GN25_1' data-id='GN25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Abraham took another wife named Keturah. </span>
<span class='v GN25_2' data-id='GN25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>She became the mother of Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah. </span>
<span class='v GN25_3' data-id='GN25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. And from Dedan came the Asshurim and Letushim and Leummim. </span>
<span class='v GN25_4' data-id='GN25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And from Midian came Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All these were the offspring of Keturah. </span>
<span class='v GN25_5' data-id='GN25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Abraham gave all his property to Isaac; </span>
<span class='v GN25_6' data-id='GN25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But to the sons of his other women he gave offerings, and sent them away, while he was still living, into the east country. </span>
<span class='v GN25_7' data-id='GN25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now the years of Abraham's life were a hundred and seventy-five. </span>
<span class='v GN25_8' data-id='GN25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Abraham came to his death, an old man, full of years; and he was put to rest with his people. </span>
<span class='v GN25_9' data-id='GN25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, put him to rest in the hollow rock of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre; </span>
<span class='v GN25_10' data-id='GN25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The same field which Abraham got from the children of Heth: there Abraham was put to rest with Sarah, his wife. </span>
<span class='v GN25_11' data-id='GN25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now after the death of Abraham, the blessing of God was with Isaac, his son. </span>
<span class='v GN25_12' data-id='GN25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now these are the generations of Ishmael, the son of Abraham, whose mother was Hagar the Egyptian, the servant of Sarah: </span>
<span class='v GN25_13' data-id='GN25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>These are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their generations: Ishmael's first son was Nebaioth; then Kedar and Adbeel and Mibsam </span>
<span class='v GN25_14' data-id='GN25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Mishma and Dumah and Massa, </span>
<span class='v GN25_15' data-id='GN25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: </span>
<span class='v GN25_16' data-id='GN25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names in their towns and their tent-circles; twelve chiefs with their peoples. </span>
<span class='v GN25_17' data-id='GN25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the years of Ishmael's life were a hundred and thirty-seven: and he came to his end, and was put to rest with his people. </span>
<span class='v GN25_18' data-id='GN25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And their country was from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt: they took their place to the east of all their brothers. </span>
<span class='v GN25_19' data-id='GN25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now these are the generations of Abraham's son Isaac: </span>
<span class='v GN25_20' data-id='GN25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean of Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramaean, to be his wife. </span>
<span class='v GN25_21' data-id='GN25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Isaac made prayer to the Lord for his wife because she had no children; and the Lord gave ear to his prayer, and Rebekah became with child. </span>
<span class='v GN25_22' data-id='GN25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the children were fighting together inside her, and she said, If it is to be so, why am I like this? So she went to put her question to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v GN25_23' data-id='GN25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to her, Two nations are in your body, and two peoples will come to birth from you: the one will be stronger than the other, and the older will be the servant of the younger. </span>
<span class='v GN25_24' data-id='GN25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when the time came for her to give birth, there were two children in her body. </span>
<span class='v GN25_25' data-id='GN25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the first came out red from head to foot like a robe of hair, and they gave him the name of Esau. </span>
<span class='v GN25_26' data-id='GN25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And after him, his brother came out, gripping Esau's foot; and he was named Jacob: Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them. </span>
<span class='v GN25_27' data-id='GN25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the boys came to full growth; and Esau became a man of the open country, an expert bowman; but Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. </span>
<span class='v GN25_28' data-id='GN25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac's love was for Esau, because Esau's meat was greatly to his taste: but Rebekah had more love for Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN25_29' data-id='GN25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And one day Jacob was cooking some soup when Esau came in from the fields in great need of food; </span>
<span class='v GN25_30' data-id='GN25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Esau said to Jacob, Give me a full meal of that red soup, for I am overcome with need for food: for this reason he was named Edom. </span>
<span class='v GN25_31' data-id='GN25_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said, First of all give me your birthright. </span>
<span class='v GN25_32' data-id='GN25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And Esau said, Truly, I am at the point of death: what profit is the birthright to me? </span>
<span class='v GN25_33' data-id='GN25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said, First of all give me your oath; and he gave him his oath, handing over his birthright to Jacob. </span>
<span class='v GN25_34' data-id='GN25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then Jacob gave him bread and soup; and he took food and drink and went away, caring little for his birthright. </span></div></div>
