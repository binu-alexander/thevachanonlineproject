<span class='v JB36_2' data-id='JB36_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give me a little more time, and I will make it clear to you; for I have still something to say for God. </span>
<span class='v JB36_3' data-id='JB36_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I will get my knowledge from far, and I will give righteousness to my Maker. </span>
<span class='v JB36_4' data-id='JB36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For truly my words are not false; one who has all knowledge is talking with you. </span>
<span class='v JB36_5' data-id='JB36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Truly, God gives up the hard-hearted, and will not give life to the sinner. </span>
<span class='v JB36_6' data-id='JB36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>His eyes are ever on the upright, and he gives to the crushed their right; </span>
<span class='v JB36_7' data-id='JB36_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Lifting them up to the seat of kings, and making them safe for ever. </span>
