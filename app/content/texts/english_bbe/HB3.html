<span class='v HB3_1' data-id='HB3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this reason, holy brothers, marked out to have a part in heaven, give thought to Jesus the representative and high priest of our faith; </span>
<span class='v HB3_2' data-id='HB3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Who kept faith with God who gave him his place, even as Moses did in all his house. </span>
<span class='v HB3_3' data-id='HB3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And it was right for this man to have more honour than Moses, even as the builder of a house has more honour than the house. </span>
<span class='v HB3_4' data-id='HB3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For every house has a builder; but the builder of all things is God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_5' data-id='HB3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Moses certainly kept faith as a servant, in all his house, and as a witness of those things which were to be said later; </span>
<span class='v HB3_6' data-id='HB3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we keep our hearts fixed in the glad and certain hope till the end. </span>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And so, as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you let his voice come to your ears, </span>
<span class='v HB3_8' data-id='HB3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Be not hard of heart, as when you made me angry, on the day of testing in the waste land, </span>
<span class='v HB3_9' data-id='HB3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When your fathers put me to the test, and saw my works for forty years. </span>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So that I was angry with this generation, and I said, Their hearts are in error at all times, and they have no knowledge of my ways; </span>
<span class='v HB3_11' data-id='HB3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And being angry I made an oath, saying, They may not come into my rest. </span>
<span class='v HB3_12' data-id='HB3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My brothers, take care that there is not by chance in any one of you an evil heart without belief, turning away from the living God: </span>
<span class='v HB3_13' data-id='HB3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But give comfort to one another every day as long as it is still Today; so that no one among you may be made hard by the deceit of sin: </span>
<span class='v HB3_14' data-id='HB3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For if we keep the substance of the faith which we had at the start, even till the end, we have a part with Christ; </span>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As it is said, Today if you will let his voice come to your ears, be not hard of heart, as when you made him angry. </span>
<span class='v HB3_16' data-id='HB3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Who made him angry when his voice came to them? was it not all those who came out of Egypt with Moses? </span>
<span class='v HB3_17' data-id='HB3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And with whom was he angry for forty years? was it not with those who did evil, who came to their deaths in the waste land? </span>
<span class='v HB3_18' data-id='HB3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And to whom did he make an oath that they might not come into his rest? was it not to those who went against his orders? </span>
<span class='v HB3_19' data-id='HB3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So we see that they were not able to go in because they had no belief. </span></div></div>
