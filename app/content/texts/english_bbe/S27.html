<span class='v S27_1' data-id='S27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when the king was living in his house, and the Lord had given him rest from war on every side; </span>
<span class='v S27_2' data-id='S27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of God is housed inside the curtains of a tent. </span>
<span class='v S27_3' data-id='S27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Nathan said to the king, Go and do whatever is in your heart; for the Lord is with you. </span>
<span class='v S27_4' data-id='S27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now that night the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying, </span>
<span class='v S27_5' data-id='S27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Go and say to my servant David, The Lord says, Are you to be the builder of a house, a living-place for me? </span>
<span class='v S27_6' data-id='S27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For from the day when I took the children of Israel up out of Egypt till this day, I have had no house, but have gone from place to place in a tent. </span>
<span class='v S27_7' data-id='S27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In all the places where I went with all the children of Israel, did I ever say to any of the judges of Israel, to whom I gave the care of my people Israel, Why have you not made me a house of cedar? </span>
<span class='v S27_8' data-id='S27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then say these words to my servant David, The Lord of armies says, I took you from the fields, from keeping the sheep, so that you might be a ruler over my people, over my people Israel: </span>
<span class='v S27_9' data-id='S27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And I have been with you wherever you went, cutting off before you all those who were against you; and I will make your name great, like the name of the greatest ones of the earth. </span>
<span class='v S27_10' data-id='S27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I will make a resting-place for my people Israel, planting them there, so that they may be living in the place which is theirs, and never again be moved; and never again will they be troubled by evil men as they were at the first, </span>
<span class='v S27_11' data-id='S27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>From the time when I put judges over my people Israel; and I will give you peace from all who are against you. And the Lord says to you that he will make you the head of a line of kings. </span>
<span class='v S27_12' data-id='S27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when the time comes for you to go to rest with your fathers, I will put in your place your seed after you, the offspring of your body, and I will make his kingdom strong. </span>
<span class='v S27_13' data-id='S27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He will be the builder of a house for my name, and I will make the seat of his authority certain for ever. </span>
<span class='v S27_14' data-id='S27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I will be to him a father and he will be to me a son: if he does wrong, I will give him punishment with the rod of men and with the blows of the children of men; </span>
<span class='v S27_15' data-id='S27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But my mercy will not be taken away from him, as I took it from him who was before you. </span>
<span class='v S27_16' data-id='S27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And your family and your kingdom will keep their place before me for ever: the seat of your authority will never be overturned. </span>
<span class='v S27_17' data-id='S27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Nathan gave David an account of all these words and this vision. </span>
<span class='v S27_18' data-id='S27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then David the king went in and took his seat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my family, that you have been my guide till now? </span>
<span class='v S27_19' data-id='S27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And this was only a small thing to you, O Lord God; but your words have even been about the far-off future of your servant's family, O Lord God! </span>
<span class='v S27_20' data-id='S27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>What more may David say to you? for you have knowledge of your servant, O Lord God. </span>
<span class='v S27_21' data-id='S27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Because of your word and from your heart, you have done all this great work, and let your servant see it. </span>
<span class='v S27_22' data-id='S27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Truly you are great, O Lord God: there is no one like you and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears. </span>
<span class='v S27_23' data-id='S27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, and to make a name for himself, and to do great and strange things for them, driving out a nation and its gods from before his people? </span>
<span class='v S27_24' data-id='S27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But you took and made strong for yourself your people Israel, to be your people for ever; and you, Lord, became their God. </span>
<span class='v S27_25' data-id='S27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And now, O Lord God, may the word which you have said about your servant and about his family, be made certain for ever, and may you do as you have said! </span>
<span class='v S27_26' data-id='S27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And let your name be made great for ever, and let men say, The Lord of armies is God over Israel: and let the family of David your servant be made strong before you! </span>
<span class='v S27_27' data-id='S27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For you, O Lord of armies, the God of Israel, have clearly said to your servant, I will make you the head of a family of kings: and so it has come into your servant's heart to make this prayer to you. </span>
<span class='v S27_28' data-id='S27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And now, O Lord God, you are God and your words are true and you have said you will give your servant this good thing; </span>
<span class='v S27_29' data-id='S27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So may it be your pleasure to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you: (for you, O Lord God, have said it,) and may your blessing be on your servant's family line for ever! </span></div></div>
