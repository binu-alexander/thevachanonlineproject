<span class='v PS64_1' data-id='PS64_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>O God, let the voice of my grief come to your ear: keep my life from the fear of those who are against me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_2' data-id='PS64_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Keep me safe from the secret purpose of wrongdoers; from the band of the workers of evil; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_3' data-id='PS64_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Who make their tongues sharp like a sword, and whose arrows are pointed, even bitter words; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_4' data-id='PS64_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So that in secret they may let loose their arrows at the upright, suddenly and unseen. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_5' data-id='PS64_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They make themselves strong in an evil purpose; they make holes for secret nets; they say, Who will see it, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_6' data-id='PS64_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Or make discovery of our secret purpose? The design is framed with care; and the inner thought of a man, and his heart, is deep. </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS64_8' data-id='PS64_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The evil of their tongues is the cause of their fall; all those who see them are shaking their heads at them. </span></div>

<span class='v PS64_9' data-id='PS64_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And in fear men make public the works of God; and giving thought to his acts they get wisdom. </span></div>
