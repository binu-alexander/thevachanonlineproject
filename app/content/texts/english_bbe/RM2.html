<span class='v RM2_1' data-id='RM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So you have no reason, whoever you are, for judging: for in judging another you are judging yourself, for you do the same things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_2' data-id='RM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And we are conscious that God is a true judge against those who do such things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_3' data-id='RM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But you who are judging another for doing what you do yourself, are you hoping that God's decision will not take effect against you? </span>
<span class='v RM2_4' data-id='RM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or is it nothing to you that God had pity on you, waiting and putting up with you for so long, not seeing that in his pity God's desire is to give you a change of heart? </span>
<span class='v RM2_5' data-id='RM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But by your hard and unchanged heart you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of the revelation of God's judging in righteousness; </span>
<span class='v RM2_6' data-id='RM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who will give to every man his right reward: </span>
<span class='v RM2_7' data-id='RM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To those who go on with good works in the hope of glory and honour and salvation from death, he will give eternal life: </span>
<span class='v RM2_8' data-id='RM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But to those who, from a love of competition, are not guided by what is true, will come the heat of his wrath, </span>
<span class='v RM2_9' data-id='RM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Trouble and sorrow on all whose works are evil, to the Jew first and then to the Greek; </span>
<span class='v RM2_10' data-id='RM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But glory and honour and peace to all whose works are good, to the Jew first and then to the Greek: </span>
<span class='v RM2_11' data-id='RM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For one man is not different from another before God. </span>
<span class='v RM2_12' data-id='RM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>All those who have done wrong without the law will get destruction without the law: and those who have done wrong under the law will have their punishment by the law; </span>
<span class='v RM2_13' data-id='RM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it is not the hearers of the law who will be judged as having righteousness before God, but only the doers: </span>
<span class='v RM2_14' data-id='RM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For when the Gentiles without the law have a natural desire to do the things in the law, they are a law to themselves; </span>
<span class='v RM2_15' data-id='RM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Because the work of the law is seen in their hearts, their sense of right and wrong giving witness to it, while their minds are at one time judging them and at another giving them approval; </span>
<span class='v RM2_16' data-id='RM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In the day when God will be a judge of the secrets of men, as it says in the good news of which I am a preacher, through Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v RM2_17' data-id='RM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But as for you who have the name of Jew, and are resting on the law, and take pride in God, </span>
<span class='v RM2_18' data-id='RM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And have knowledge of his desires, and are a judge of the things which are different, having the learning of the law, </span>
<span class='v RM2_19' data-id='RM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>In the belief that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in the dark, </span>
<span class='v RM2_20' data-id='RM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>A teacher of the foolish, having in the law the form of knowledge and of what is true; </span>
<span class='v RM2_21' data-id='RM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You who give teaching to others, do you give it to yourself? you who say that a man may not take what is not his, do you take what is not yours? </span>
<span class='v RM2_22' data-id='RM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You who say that a man may not be untrue to his wife, are you true to yours? you who are a hater of images, do you do wrong to the house of God? </span>
<span class='v RM2_23' data-id='RM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You who take pride in the law, are you doing wrong to the honour of God by behaviour which is against the law? </span>
<span class='v RM2_24' data-id='RM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For the name of God is shamed among the Gentiles because of you, as it is said in the holy Writings. </span>
<span class='v RM2_25' data-id='RM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>It is true that circumcision is of use if you keep the law, but if you go against the law it is as if you had it not. </span>
<span class='v RM2_26' data-id='RM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>If those who have not circumcision keep the rules of the law, will it not be credited to them as circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM2_27' data-id='RM2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And they, by their keeping of the law without circumcision, will be judges of you, by whom the law is broken though you have the letter of the law and circumcision. </span>
<span class='v RM2_28' data-id='RM2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The true Jew is not one who is only so publicly, and circumcision is not that which may be seen in the flesh: </span>
<span class='v RM2_29' data-id='RM2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But he is a Jew who is a secret one, whose circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God. </span></div></div>
