<span class='v NU31_1' data-id='NU31_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU31_2' data-id='NU31_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give the Midianites punishment for the wrong they did to the children of Israel: and after that you will go to rest with your people. </span>
<span class='v NU31_3' data-id='NU31_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Moses said to the people, Let men from among you be armed for war to put into effect against Midian the Lord's punishment on them. </span>
<span class='v NU31_4' data-id='NU31_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>From every tribe of Israel send a thousand to the war. </span>
<span class='v NU31_5' data-id='NU31_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So from the thousands of Israel a thousand were taken from every tribe, twelve thousand men armed for war. </span>
<span class='v NU31_6' data-id='NU31_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Moses sent them out to war, a thousand from every tribe, and with them Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, taking in his hands the vessels of the holy place and the horns for sounding the note of war. </span>
<span class='v NU31_7' data-id='NU31_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they made war on Midian, as the Lord gave orders to Moses; and they put to death every male. </span>
<span class='v NU31_8' data-id='NU31_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They put the kings of Midian to death with the rest, Evi and Reken and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian: and Balaam, the son of Beor, they put to death with the sword. </span>
<span class='v NU31_9' data-id='NU31_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The women of Midian with their little ones the children of Israel took prisoner; and all their cattle and flocks and all their goods they took for themselves; </span>
<span class='v NU31_10' data-id='NU31_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And after burning all their towns and all their tent-circles, </span>
<span class='v NU31_11' data-id='NU31_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They went away with the goods they had taken, man and beast. </span>
<span class='v NU31_12' data-id='NU31_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the prisoners and the goods and everything they had taken, they took to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the people of Israel, to the tent-circle in the lowlands of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. </span>
<span class='v NU31_13' data-id='NU31_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Eleazar the priest and the chiefs of the people went out to them before they had come into the tent-circle. </span>
<span class='v NU31_14' data-id='NU31_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Moses was angry with the chiefs of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who had come back from the war. </span>
<span class='v NU31_15' data-id='NU31_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Moses said to them, Why have you kept all the women safe? </span>
<span class='v NU31_16' data-id='NU31_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>It was these who, moved by Balaam, were the cause of Israel's sin against the Lord in the question of Peor, because of which disease came on the people of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v NU31_17' data-id='NU31_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So now put every male child to death, and every woman who has had sex relations with a man. </span>
<span class='v NU31_18' data-id='NU31_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But all the female children who have had no sex relations with men, you may keep for yourselves. </span>
<span class='v NU31_19' data-id='NU31_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You yourselves will have to keep outside the tent-circle for seven days, anyone of you who has put any person to death or come near a dead body; and on the third day and on the seventh day make yourselves and your prisoners clean. </span>
<span class='v NU31_20' data-id='NU31_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And every bit of clothing, and anything made of leather or goats' hair or wood, you are to make clean. </span>
<span class='v NU31_21' data-id='NU31_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had been to the fight, This is the rule of the law which the Lord has given to Moses: </span>
<span class='v NU31_22' data-id='NU31_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead, </span>
<span class='v NU31_23' data-id='NU31_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And anything which may be heated, is to go through the fire and be made clean; but in addition it is to be put in the water of cleaning: and anything which may not go through the fire is to be put in the water. </span>
<span class='v NU31_24' data-id='NU31_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day, after washing your clothing, you will be clean, and then you may come into the tent-circle. </span>
<span class='v NU31_25' data-id='NU31_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU31_26' data-id='NU31_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Get an account of everything which was taken in the war, of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of families of the people: </span>
<span class='v NU31_27' data-id='NU31_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And let division be made of it into two parts, one for the men of war who went out to the fight, and one for all the people: </span>
<span class='v NU31_28' data-id='NU31_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And from the men of war who went out let there be offered to the Lord one out of every five hundred, from the persons, and from the oxen and asses and sheep: </span>
<span class='v NU31_29' data-id='NU31_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Take this from their part and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to be lifted up to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v NU31_30' data-id='NU31_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And from the part given to the children of Israel, take one out of every fifty, from the persons, and from the oxen and asses and sheep, and give it to the Levites who have the care of the House of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v NU31_31' data-id='NU31_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So Eleazar and Moses did as the Lord had given orders to Moses. </span>
<span class='v NU31_32' data-id='NU31_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now the beasts taken, in addition to what the fighting-men took for themselves, were six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, </span>
<span class='v NU31_33' data-id='NU31_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And seventy-two thousand oxen, </span>
<span class='v NU31_34' data-id='NU31_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And sixty-one thousand asses; </span>
<span class='v NU31_35' data-id='NU31_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And thirty-two thousand persons, that is, women who had never had sex relations with a man. </span>
<span class='v NU31_36' data-id='NU31_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And the half given as their part to the men who went to the war, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, five hundred sheep, </span>
<span class='v NU31_37' data-id='NU31_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Of which the Lord's part was six hundred and seventy-five. </span>
<span class='v NU31_38' data-id='NU31_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The number of oxen was thirty-six thousand, of which the Lord's part was seventy-two; </span>
<span class='v NU31_39' data-id='NU31_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>The number of asses was thirty thousand, five hundred, of which the Lord's part was sixty-one. </span>
<span class='v NU31_40' data-id='NU31_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And the number of persons was sixteen thousand, of which the Lord's part was thirty-two persons. </span>
<span class='v NU31_41' data-id='NU31_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And Moses gave the Lord's part, lifted up as an offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord had given orders to Moses. </span>
<span class='v NU31_42' data-id='NU31_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And from the half given to the children of Israel, which Moses had kept separate from that given to the fighting-men, </span>
<span class='v NU31_43' data-id='NU31_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>(Now the people's half was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, five hundred sheep, </span>
<span class='v NU31_44' data-id='NU31_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And thirty-six thousand oxen, </span>
<span class='v NU31_45' data-id='NU31_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And thirty thousand, five hundred asses, </span>
<span class='v NU31_46' data-id='NU31_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And sixteen thousand persons;) </span>
<span class='v NU31_47' data-id='NU31_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Even from the children of Israel's half, Moses took one out of every fifty, men and beasts, and gave them to the Levites who had the care of the House of the Lord; as the Lord gave orders to Moses. </span>
<span class='v NU31_48' data-id='NU31_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Then the men in authority over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came to Moses, </span>
<span class='v NU31_49' data-id='NU31_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And said to him, Your servants have taken note of the number of all the fighting-men under our orders, and every one is present; </span>
<span class='v NU31_50' data-id='NU31_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And we have here an offering for the Lord from what every man took in the war, ornaments of gold, leg-chains and arm-rings, finger-rings, ear-rings, and neck-ornaments, to make our souls free from sin before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v NU31_51' data-id='NU31_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even all the worked ornaments. </span>
<span class='v NU31_52' data-id='NU31_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And the gold which the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds gave, as an offering to be lifted up before the Lord, came to sixteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty shekels. </span>
<span class='v NU31_53' data-id='NU31_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>(For every man of the army had taken goods for himself in the war.) </span>
<span class='v NU31_54' data-id='NU31_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold given by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and took it into the Tent of meeting, to be a sign in memory of the children of Israel before the Lord. </span></div></div>
