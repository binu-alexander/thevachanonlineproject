<span class='v R218_1' data-id='R218_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Jehoshaphat had great wealth and honour, and his son was married to Ahab's daughter. </span>
<span class='v R218_2' data-id='R218_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And after some years he went down to Samaria to see Ahab. And Ahab made a feast for him and the people who were with him, putting to death great numbers of sheep and oxen; and he got Jehoshaphat to go with him to Ramoth-gilead. </span>
<span class='v R218_3' data-id='R218_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Ahab, king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he said, I am as you are, and my people as your people; we will be with you in the war. </span>
<span class='v R218_4' data-id='R218_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Let us now get directions from the Lord. </span>
<span class='v R218_5' data-id='R218_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel got together all the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Am I to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And they said, Go up: for God will give it into the hands of the king. </span>
<span class='v R218_6' data-id='R218_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there no other prophet of the Lord here from whom we may get directions? </span>
<span class='v R218_7' data-id='R218_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is still one man by whom we may get directions from the Lord, but I have no love for him, because he has never been a prophet of good to me, but only of evil: he is Micaiah, the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. </span>
<span class='v R218_8' data-id='R218_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Israel sent for one of his unsexed servants and said, Go quickly and come back with Micaiah, the son of Imla. </span>
<span class='v R218_9' data-id='R218_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were seated on their seats of authority, dressed in their robes, by the doorway into Samaria; and all the prophets were acting as prophets before them. </span>
<span class='v R218_10' data-id='R218_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself iron horns and said, The Lord says, Pushing back the Aramaeans with these, you will put an end to them completely. </span>
<span class='v R218_11' data-id='R218_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And all the prophets said the same thing, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and it will go well for you, for the Lord will give it into the hands of the king. </span>
<span class='v R218_12' data-id='R218_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now the servant who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, See now, all the prophets with one voice are saying good things to the king; so let your words be like theirs, and say good things. </span>
<span class='v R218_13' data-id='R218_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, By the living Lord, whatever the Lord says to me I will say. </span>
<span class='v R218_14' data-id='R218_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, are we to go to Ramoth-gilead to make war or not? And he said, Go up, and it will go well for you; and they will be given up into your hands. </span>
<span class='v R218_15' data-id='R218_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the king said to him, Have I not, again and again, put you on your oath to say nothing to me but what is true in the name of the Lord? </span>
<span class='v R218_16' data-id='R218_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then he said, I saw all Israel wandering on the mountains like sheep without a keeper; and the Lord said, These have no master: let them go back, every man to his house in peace. </span>
<span class='v R218_17' data-id='R218_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not say that he would not be a prophet of good to me, but of evil? </span>
<span class='v R218_18' data-id='R218_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then he said, Give ear now to the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord seated on his seat of power, and all the army of heaven in their places, at his right hand and at his left. </span>
<span class='v R218_19' data-id='R218_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, How may Ahab, king of Israel, be tricked into going up to Ramoth-gilead to his death? And one said one thing and one another. </span>
<span class='v R218_20' data-id='R218_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then a spirit came forward and took his place before the Lord and said, I will get him to do it by a trick. And the Lord said to him, How? </span>
<span class='v R218_21' data-id='R218_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he said, I will go out and be a spirit of deceit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Your trick will have its effect on him: go out and do so. </span>
<span class='v R218_22' data-id='R218_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And now, see, the Lord has put a spirit of deceit in the mouth of these prophets of yours; and the Lord has said evil against you. </span>
<span class='v R218_23' data-id='R218_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and gave Micaiah a blow on the side of his face, saying, Where is the spirit of the Lord whose word is in you? </span>
<span class='v R218_24' data-id='R218_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, Truly, you will see on that day when you go into an inner room to keep yourself safe. </span>
<span class='v R218_25' data-id='R218_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the ruler of the town, and to Joash, the king's son; </span>
<span class='v R218_26' data-id='R218_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And say, By the king's order this man is to be put in prison, and given prison food till I come back in peace. </span>
<span class='v R218_27' data-id='R218_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah said, If you come back at all in peace, the Lord has not sent his word by me. </span>
<span class='v R218_28' data-id='R218_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramoth-gilead. </span>
<span class='v R218_29' data-id='R218_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will make a change in my clothing, so that I do not seem to be the king, and will go into the fight; but do you put on your robes. So the king of Israel made a change in his dress, and they went to the fight. </span>
<span class='v R218_30' data-id='R218_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now the king of Aram had given orders to the captains of his war-carriages, saying, Make no attack on small or great, but only on the king of Israel. </span>
<span class='v R218_31' data-id='R218_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So when the captains of the war-carriages saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. And turning about, they came round him, but Jehoshaphat gave a cry, and the Lord came to his help, and God sent them away from him. </span>
<span class='v R218_32' data-id='R218_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now when the captains of the war-carriages saw that he was not the king of Israel, they went back from going after him. </span>
<span class='v R218_33' data-id='R218_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And a certain man sent an arrow from his bow without thought of its direction, and gave the king of Israel a wound where his breastplate was joined to his clothing; so he said to the driver of his war-carriage, Go to one side and take me away out of the army, for I am badly wounded. </span>
<span class='v R218_34' data-id='R218_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But the fight became more violent while the day went on; and the king of Israel was supported in his war-carriage facing the Aramaeans till the evening; and by sundown he was dead. </span></div></div>
