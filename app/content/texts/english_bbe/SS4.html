<span class='v SS4_1' data-id='SS4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>See, you are fair, my love, you are fair; you have the eyes of a dove; your hair is as a flock of goats, which take their rest on the side of Gilead. </span>
<span class='v SS4_2' data-id='SS4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep whose wool is newly cut, which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young. </span>
<span class='v SS4_3' data-id='SS4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Your red lips are like a bright thread, and your mouth is fair of form; the sides of your head are like pomegranate fruit under your veil. </span>
<span class='v SS4_4' data-id='SS4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Your neck is like the tower of David made for a store-house of arms, in which a thousand breastplates are hanging, breastplates for fighting-men. </span>
<span class='v SS4_5' data-id='SS4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Your two breasts are like two young roes of the same birth, which take their food among the lilies. </span>
<span class='v SS4_6' data-id='SS4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Till the evening comes, and the sky slowly becomes dark, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. </span>
<span class='v SS4_7' data-id='SS4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You are all fair, my love; there is no mark on you. </span>
<span class='v SS4_8' data-id='SS4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon; see from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the places of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards. </span>
<span class='v SS4_9' data-id='SS4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You have taken away my heart, my sister, my bride; you have taken away my heart, with one look you have taken it, with one chain of your neck! </span>
<span class='v SS4_10' data-id='SS4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>How fair is your love, my sister! How much better is your love than wine, and the smell of your oils than any perfume! </span>
<span class='v SS4_11' data-id='SS4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Your lips are dropping honey; honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your clothing is like the smell of Lebanon. </span>
<span class='v SS4_12' data-id='SS4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>A garden walled-in is my sister, my bride; a garden shut up, a spring of water stopped. </span>
<span class='v SS4_13' data-id='SS4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The produce of the garden is pomegranates; with all the best fruits, henna and spikenard, </span>
<span class='v SS4_14' data-id='SS4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Spikenard and safron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. </span>
<span class='v SS4_15' data-id='SS4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You are a fountain of gardens, a spring of living waters, and flowing waters from Lebanon. </span>
<span class='v SS4_16' data-id='SS4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be awake, O north wind; and come, O south, blowing on my garden, so that its spices may come out. Let my loved one come into his garden, and take of his good fruits. </span></div></div>
