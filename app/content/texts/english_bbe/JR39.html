<span class='v JR39_1' data-id='JR39_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And it came about, that when Jerusalem was taken, (in the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, with all his army, came against Jerusalem, shutting it in on every side; </span>
<span class='v JR39_2' data-id='JR39_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the town was broken into:) </span>
<span class='v JR39_3' data-id='JR39_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>All the captains of the king of Babylon came in and took their places in the middle doorway of the town, Nergal-shar-ezer, ruler of Sin-magir, the Rabmag, and Nebushazban, the Rab-saris, and all the captains of the king of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR39_4' data-id='JR39_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all the men of war saw it, they went in flight from the town by night, by the way of the king's garden, through the doorway between the two walls: and they went out by the Arabah. </span>
<span class='v JR39_5' data-id='JR39_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the Chaldaean army went after them and overtook Zedekiah in the lowlands of Jericho: and they made him a prisoner and took him up to Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, to Riblah in the land of Hamath, to be judged by him. </span>
<span class='v JR39_6' data-id='JR39_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Babylon put the sons of Zedekiah to death before his eyes in Riblah: and the king of Babylon put to death all the great men of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR39_7' data-id='JR39_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And more than this, he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and had him put in chains to take him away to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR39_8' data-id='JR39_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the Chaldaeans put the king's house on fire, as well as the houses of the people, and had the walls of Jerusalem broken down. </span>
<span class='v JR39_9' data-id='JR39_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, took away to Babylon as prisoners, all the rest of the workmen who were still in the town, as well as those who had given themselves up to him, and all the rest of the people. </span>
<span class='v JR39_10' data-id='JR39_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, let the poorest of the people, who had nothing whatever, go on living in the land of Judah, and gave them vine-gardens and fields at the same time. </span>
<span class='v JR39_11' data-id='JR39_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, gave orders about Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR39_12' data-id='JR39_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Take him and keep an eye on him and see that no evil comes to him; but do with him whatever he says to you. </span>
<span class='v JR39_13' data-id='JR39_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the armed men, sent Nebushazban, the Rab-saris, and Nergal-shar-ezer, the Rabmag, and all the chief captains of the king of Babylon, </span>
<span class='v JR39_14' data-id='JR39_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And they sent and took Jeremiah out of the place of the watchmen, and gave him into the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him to his house: so he was living among the people. </span>
<span class='v JR39_15' data-id='JR39_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the place of the armed watchmen, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR39_16' data-id='JR39_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Go and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, has said: See, my words will come true for this town, for evil and not for good: they will come about before your eyes on that day. </span>
<span class='v JR39_17' data-id='JR39_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But I will keep you safe on that day, says the Lord: you will not be given into the hands of the men you are fearing. </span>
<span class='v JR39_18' data-id='JR39_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For I will certainly let you go free, and you will not be put to the sword, but your life will be given to you out of the hands of your attackers: because you have put your faith in me, says the Lord. </span></div></div>
