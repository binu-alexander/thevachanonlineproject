<span class='v T22_1' data-id='T22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So then, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_2' data-id='T22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the things which I have said to you before a number of witnesses, give to those of the faith, so that they may be teachers of others. </span>
<span class='v T22_3' data-id='T22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Be ready to do without the comforts of life, as one of the army of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_4' data-id='T22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>A fighting man, when he is with the army, keeps himself free from the business of this life so that he may be pleasing to him who has taken him into his army. </span>
<span class='v T22_5' data-id='T22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And if a man takes part in a competition he does not get the crown if he has not kept the rules. </span>
<span class='v T22_6' data-id='T22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It is right for the worker in the fields to be the first to take of the fruit. </span>
<span class='v T22_7' data-id='T22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Give thought to what I say; for the Lord will give you wisdom in all things. </span>
<span class='v T22_8' data-id='T22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Keep in mind Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, who came back from the dead, as my good news gives witness: </span>
<span class='v T22_9' data-id='T22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>In which I put up with the hardest conditions, even prison chains, like one who has done a crime; but the word of God is not in chains. </span>
<span class='v T22_10' data-id='T22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But I undergo all things for the saints, so that they may have salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </span>
<span class='v T22_11' data-id='T22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This is a true saying: If we undergo death with him, then will we be living with him: </span>
<span class='v T22_12' data-id='T22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If we go on to the end, then we will be ruling with him: if we say we have no knowledge of him, then he will say he has no knowledge of us: </span>
<span class='v T22_13' data-id='T22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If we are without faith, still he keeps faith, for he will never be untrue to himself. </span>
<span class='v T22_14' data-id='T22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Put these things before them, giving them orders in the name of the Lord to keep themselves from fighting about words, which is of no profit, only causing error in their hearers. </span>
<span class='v T22_15' data-id='T22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let it be your care to get the approval of God, as a workman who has no cause for shame, giving the true word in the right way. </span>
<span class='v T22_16' data-id='T22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But take no part in wrong and foolish talk, for those who do so will go farther into evil, </span>
<span class='v T22_17' data-id='T22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And their words will be like poisoned wounds in the flesh: such are Hymenaeus and Philetus; </span>
<span class='v T22_18' data-id='T22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Men whose ideas are all false, who say that the coming back from the dead has even now taken place, overturning the faith of some. </span>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But God's strong base is unchanging, having this sign, The Lord has knowledge of those who are his: and, Let everyone by whom the name of the Lord is named be turned away from evil. </span>
<span class='v T22_20' data-id='T22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but others of wood and earth, and some which are honoured and some without honour. </span>
<span class='v T22_21' data-id='T22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If a man makes himself clean from these, he will be a vessel for honour, made holy, ready for the master's use, ready for every good work. </span>
<span class='v T22_22' data-id='T22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But keep yourself from those desires of the flesh which are strong when the body is young, and go after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those whose prayers go up to the Lord from a clean heart. </span>
<span class='v T22_23' data-id='T22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And put away foolish and uncontrolled questionings, seeing that they are a cause of trouble. </span>
<span class='v T22_24' data-id='T22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For it is not right for the Lord's servant to make trouble, but he is to be gentle to all, ready in teaching, putting up with wrong, </span>
<span class='v T22_25' data-id='T22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Gently guiding those who go against the teaching; if by chance God may give them a change of heart and true knowledge, </span>
<span class='v T22_26' data-id='T22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And so they may get themselves free from the net of the Evil One, being made the prisoners of the Lord's servant, for the purpose of God. </span></div></div>
