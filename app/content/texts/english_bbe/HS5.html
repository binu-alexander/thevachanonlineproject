<span class='v HS5_1' data-id='HS5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear to this, O priests; give attention, O Israel, and you, family of the king; for you are to be judged; you have been a deceit at Mizpah and a net stretched out on Tabor. </span>
<span class='v HS5_2' data-id='HS5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They have gone deep in the evil ways of Shittim, but I am the judge of all. </span>
<span class='v HS5_3' data-id='HS5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I have knowledge of Ephraim, and Israel is not secret from me; for now, O Ephraim, you have been false to me, Israel has become unclean. </span>
<span class='v HS5_4' data-id='HS5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Their works will not let them come back to their God, for a false spirit is in them and they have no knowledge of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS5_5' data-id='HS5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the pride of Israel gives an answer to his face; and Ephraim will have a fall through his sins, and the fall of Judah will be the same as theirs. </span>
<span class='v HS5_6' data-id='HS5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They will go, with their flocks and their herds, in search of the Lord, but they will not see him; he has taken himself out of their view. </span>
<span class='v HS5_7' data-id='HS5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They have been false to the Lord; they have given birth to strange children; now the new moon will make them waste with their fields. </span>
<span class='v HS5_8' data-id='HS5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let the horn be sounded in Gibeah and in Ramah; give a loud cry in Beth-aven, They are after you, O Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v HS5_9' data-id='HS5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Ephraim will become a waste in the day of punishment; I have given knowledge among the tribes of Israel of what is certain. </span>
<span class='v HS5_10' data-id='HS5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The rulers of Judah are like those who take away a landmark; I will let loose my wrath on them like flowing water. </span>
<span class='v HS5_11' data-id='HS5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is troubled; he is crushed by his judges, because he took pleasure in walking after deceit. </span>
<span class='v HS5_12' data-id='HS5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And so to Ephraim I am like a wasting insect, and a destruction to the children of Judah. </span>
<span class='v HS5_13' data-id='HS5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When Ephraim saw his disease and Judah his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to the great king; but he is not able to make you well or give you help for your wound. </span>
<span class='v HS5_14' data-id='HS5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For I will be to Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the children of Judah; I, even I, will give him wounds and go away; I will take him away, and there will be no helper. </span>
<span class='v HS5_15' data-id='HS5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I will go back to my place till they are made waste; in their trouble they will go after me early and will make search for me. </span></div></div>
