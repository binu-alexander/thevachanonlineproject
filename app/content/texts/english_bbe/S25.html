<span class='v S25_1' data-id='S25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David in Hebron and said, Truly, we are your bone and your flesh. </span>
<span class='v S25_2' data-id='S25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In the past when Saul was king over us, it was you who went at the head of Israel when they went out or came in: and the Lord said to you, You are to be the keeper of my people Israel and their ruler. </span>
<span class='v S25_3' data-id='S25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So all the responsible men of Israel came to the king at Hebron; and King David made an agreement with them in Hebron before the Lord: and they put the holy oil on David and made him king over Israel. </span>
<span class='v S25_4' data-id='S25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>David was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king for forty years, </span>
<span class='v S25_5' data-id='S25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Ruling over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem, over all Israel and Judah, for thirty-three years. </span>
<span class='v S25_6' data-id='S25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the people of the land: and they said to David, You will not come in here, but the blind and the feeble-footed will keep you out; for they said, David will not be able to come in here. </span>
<span class='v S25_7' data-id='S25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But David took the strong place of Zion, which is the town of David. </span>
<span class='v S25_8' data-id='S25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And that day David said, Whoever makes an attack on the Jebusites, let him go up by the water-pipe, and put to death all the blind and feeble-footed who are hated by David. And this is why they say, The blind and feeble-footed may not come into the house. </span>
<span class='v S25_9' data-id='S25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So David took the strong tower for his living-place, naming it the town of David. And David took in hand the building of the town all round, starting from the Millo. </span>
<span class='v S25_10' data-id='S25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And David became greater and greater; for the Lord, the God of armies, was with him. </span>
<span class='v S25_11' data-id='S25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Hiram, king of Tyre, sent men to David, with cedar-trees and woodworkers and stoneworkers: and they made David a house. </span>
<span class='v S25_12' data-id='S25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And David saw that the Lord had made his position safe as king over Israel, and that he had made his kingdom great because of his people Israel. </span>
<span class='v S25_13' data-id='S25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And David took more women and wives in Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron: and he had more sons and daughters. </span>
<span class='v S25_14' data-id='S25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>These are the names of those whose birth took place in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon </span>
<span class='v S25_15' data-id='S25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia </span>
<span class='v S25_16' data-id='S25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet. </span>
<span class='v S25_17' data-id='S25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when the Philistines had news that David had been made king over Israel, they all went up in search of David; and David, hearing of it, went down to the strong place. </span>
<span class='v S25_18' data-id='S25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when the Philistines came, they went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v S25_19' data-id='S25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And David, desiring directions from the Lord, said, Am I to go up against the Philistines? will you give them up into my hands? And the Lord said, Go up, for I will certainly give up the Philistines into your hands. </span>
<span class='v S25_20' data-id='S25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And David went to Baal-perazim, and overcame them there; and he said, The Lord has let the forces fighting against me be broken before me as a wall is broken by rushing waters. So that place was named Baal-perazim. </span>
<span class='v S25_21' data-id='S25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines, when they went in flight, did not take their images with them, and David and his men took them away. </span>
<span class='v S25_22' data-id='S25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the Philistines came up again, and went in every direction in the valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v S25_23' data-id='S25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when David went for directions to the Lord, he said, You are not to go up against them in front; but make a circle round them from the back and come on them opposite the spice-trees. </span>
<span class='v S25_24' data-id='S25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then at the sound of footsteps in the tops of the trees, go forward quickly, for the Lord has gone out before you to overcome the army of the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v S25_25' data-id='S25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And David did as the Lord had said; and he overcame the Philistines, attacking them from Gibeon to near Gezer. </span></div></div>
