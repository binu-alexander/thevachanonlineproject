<span class='v JB11_1' data-id='JB11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Zophar the Naamathite made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB11_2' data-id='JB11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Are all these words to go unanswered? and is a man seen to be right because he is full of talk? </span>
<span class='v JB11_3' data-id='JB11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Are your words of pride to make men keep quiet? and are you to make sport, with no one to put you to shame? </span>
<span class='v JB11_4' data-id='JB11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You may say, My way is clean, and I am free from sin in your eyes. </span>
<span class='v JB11_5' data-id='JB11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if only God would take up the word, opening his lips in argument with you; </span>
<span class='v JB11_6' data-id='JB11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And would make clear to you the secrets of wisdom, and the wonders of his purpose! </span>
<span class='v JB11_7' data-id='JB11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Are you able to take God's measure, to make discovery of the limits of the Ruler of all? </span>
<span class='v JB11_8' data-id='JB11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They are higher than heaven; what is there for you to do? deeper than the underworld, and outside your knowledge; </span>
<span class='v JB11_9' data-id='JB11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Longer in measure than the earth, and wider than the sea. </span>
<span class='v JB11_10' data-id='JB11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If he goes on his way, shutting a man up and putting him to death, who may make him go back from his purpose? </span>
<span class='v JB11_11' data-id='JB11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For in his eyes men are as nothing; he sees evil and takes note of it. </span>
<span class='v JB11_12' data-id='JB11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And so a hollow-minded man will get wisdom, when a young ass of the field gets teaching. </span>
<span class='v JB11_13' data-id='JB11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But if you put your heart right, stretching out your hands to him; </span>
<span class='v JB11_14' data-id='JB11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If you put far away the evil of your hands, and let no wrongdoing have a place in your tent; </span>
<span class='v JB11_15' data-id='JB11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then truly your face will be lifted up, with no mark of sin, and you will be fixed in your place without fear: </span>
<span class='v JB11_16' data-id='JB11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For your sorrow will go from your memory, like waters flowing away: </span>
<span class='v JB11_17' data-id='JB11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And your life will be brighter than day; though it is dark, it will become like the morning. </span>
<span class='v JB11_18' data-id='JB11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And you will be safe because there is hope; after looking round, you will take your rest in quiet; </span>
<span class='v JB11_19' data-id='JB11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Sleeping with no fear of danger; and men will be desiring to have grace in your eyes; </span>
<span class='v JB11_20' data-id='JB11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the eyes of the evil-doers will be wasting away; their way of flight is gone, and their only hope is the taking of their last breath. </span></div></div>
