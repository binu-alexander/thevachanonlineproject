<span class='v JB9_1' data-id='JB9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB9_2' data-id='JB9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Truly, I see that it is so: and how is it possible for a man to get his right before God? </span>
<span class='v JB9_3' data-id='JB9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If a man was desiring to go to law with him, he would not be able to give him an answer to one out of a thousand questions. </span>
<span class='v JB9_4' data-id='JB9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He is wise in heart and great in strength: who ever made his face hard against him, and any good came of it? </span>
<span class='v JB9_5' data-id='JB9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is he who takes away the mountains without their knowledge, overturning them in his wrath: </span>
<span class='v JB9_6' data-id='JB9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who is moving the earth out of its place, so that its pillars are shaking: </span>
<span class='v JB9_7' data-id='JB9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who gives orders to the sun, and it does not give its light; and who keeps the stars from shining. </span>
<span class='v JB9_8' data-id='JB9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>By whose hand the heavens were stretched out, and who is walking on the waves of the sea: </span>
<span class='v JB9_9' data-id='JB9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Who made the Bear and Orion, and the Pleiades, and the store-houses of the south: </span>
<span class='v JB9_10' data-id='JB9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Who does great things not to be searched out; yes, wonders without number. </span>
<span class='v JB9_11' data-id='JB9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>See, he goes past me and I see him not: he goes on before, but I have no knowledge of him. </span>
<span class='v JB9_12' data-id='JB9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If he puts out his hand to take, by whom may it be turned back? who may say to him, What are you doing? </span>
<span class='v JB9_13' data-id='JB9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>God's wrath may not be turned back; the helpers of Rahab were bent down under him. </span>
<span class='v JB9_14' data-id='JB9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>How much less may I give an answer to him, using the right words in argument with him? </span>
<span class='v JB9_15' data-id='JB9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Even if my cause was good, I would not be able to give an answer; I would make request for grace from him who was against me. </span>
<span class='v JB9_16' data-id='JB9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If I had sent for him to be present, and he had come, I would have no faith that he would give ear to my voice. </span>
<span class='v JB9_17' data-id='JB9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For I would be crushed by his storm, my wounds would be increased without cause. </span>
<span class='v JB9_18' data-id='JB9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He would not let me take my breath, but I would be full of bitter grief. </span>
<span class='v JB9_19' data-id='JB9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If it is a question of strength, he says, Here I am! and if it is a question of a cause at law, he says, Who will give me a fixed day? </span>
<span class='v JB9_20' data-id='JB9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Though I was in the right, he would say that I was in the wrong; I have done no evil; but he says that I am a sinner. </span>
<span class='v JB9_21' data-id='JB9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I have done no wrong; I give no thought to what becomes of me; I have no desire for life. </span>
<span class='v JB9_22' data-id='JB9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>It is all the same to me; so I say, He puts an end to the sinner and to him who has done no wrong together. </span>
<span class='v JB9_23' data-id='JB9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If death comes suddenly through disease, he makes sport of the fate of those who have done no wrong. </span>
<span class='v JB9_24' data-id='JB9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The land is given into the power of the evil-doer; the faces of its judges are covered; if not by him, then who has done it? </span>
<span class='v JB9_25' data-id='JB9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>My days go quicker than a post-runner: they go in flight, they see no good. </span>
<span class='v JB9_26' data-id='JB9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They go rushing on like reed-boats, like an eagle dropping suddenly on its food. </span>
<span class='v JB9_27' data-id='JB9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If I say, I will put my grief out of mind, I will let my face be sad no longer and I will be bright; </span>
<span class='v JB9_28' data-id='JB9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I go in fear of all my pains; I am certain that I will not be free from sin in your eyes. </span>
<span class='v JB9_29' data-id='JB9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>You will not let me be clear of sin! why then do I take trouble for nothing? </span>
<span class='v JB9_30' data-id='JB9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If I am washed with snow water, and make my hands clean with soap; </span>
<span class='v JB9_31' data-id='JB9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then you will have me pushed into the dust, so that I will seem disgusting to my very clothing. </span>
<span class='v JB9_32' data-id='JB9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For he is not a man as I am, that I might give him an answer, that we might come together before a judge. </span>
<span class='v JB9_33' data-id='JB9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>There is no one to give a decision between us, who might have control over us. </span>
<span class='v JB9_34' data-id='JB9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Let him take away his rod from me and not send his fear on me: </span>
<span class='v JB9_35' data-id='JB9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then I would say what is in my mind without fear of him; for there is no cause of fear in myself. </span></div></div>
