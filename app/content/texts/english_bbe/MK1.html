<span class='v MK1_1' data-id='MK1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The first words of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. </span>
<span class='v MK1_2' data-id='MK1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Even as it is said in the book of Isaiah the prophet, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way; </span>
<span class='v MK1_3' data-id='MK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight; </span>
<span class='v MK1_4' data-id='MK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>John came, and gave baptism in the waste land, preaching baptism as a sign of forgiveness of sin for those whose hearts were changed. </span>
<span class='v MK1_5' data-id='MK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And there went out to him all the people of Judaea, and all those of Jerusalem, and they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying that they were sinners. </span>
<span class='v MK1_6' data-id='MK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey. </span>
<span class='v MK1_7' data-id='MK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he said to them all, There is one coming after me who is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to undo. </span>
<span class='v MK1_8' data-id='MK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I have given you baptism with water, but he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v MK1_9' data-id='MK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And it came about in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given baptism by John in the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v MK1_10' data-id='MK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And straight away, coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens broken open and the Spirit coming down on him as a dove: </span>
<span class='v MK1_11' data-id='MK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And a voice came out of heaven, You are my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. </span>
<span class='v MK1_12' data-id='MK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And straight away the Spirit sent him out into the waste land. </span>
<span class='v MK1_13' data-id='MK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he was in the waste land for forty days, being tested by Satan; and he was with the beasts; and the angels took care of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_14' data-id='MK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now after John had been put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the good news of God, </span>
<span class='v MK1_15' data-id='MK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And saying, The time has come, and the kingdom of God is near: let your hearts be turned from sin and have faith in the good news. </span>
<span class='v MK1_16' data-id='MK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And going by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, the brother of Simon, putting a net into the sea: for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class='v MK1_17' data-id='MK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. </span>
<span class='v MK1_18' data-id='MK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they went straight from their nets, and came after him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_19' data-id='MK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were in their boat stitching up their nets. </span>
<span class='v MK1_20' data-id='MK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he said, Come after me: and they went away from their father Zebedee, who was in the boat with the servants, and came after him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_21' data-id='MK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they came to Capernaum; and on the Sabbath he went into the Synagogue and gave teaching. </span>
<span class='v MK1_22' data-id='MK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they were full of wonder at his teaching, because he gave it as one having authority, and not like the scribes. </span>
<span class='v MK1_23' data-id='MK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And there was in their Synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he gave a cry, </span>
<span class='v MK1_24' data-id='MK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I see well who you are, the Holy One of God. </span>
<span class='v MK1_25' data-id='MK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him sharply, Be quiet, and come out of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_26' data-id='MK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the unclean spirit, shaking him violently, and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_27' data-id='MK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And they were all greatly surprised, so that they put questions to one another, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he gives orders even to the unclean spirits, and they do what he says. </span>
<span class='v MK1_28' data-id='MK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And news of him went out quickly everywhere into all parts of Galilee round about. </span>
<span class='v MK1_29' data-id='MK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And when they came out of the Synagogue, they went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. </span>
<span class='v MK1_30' data-id='MK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon's wife's mother was ill, with a burning heat; and they gave him word of her: </span>
<span class='v MK1_31' data-id='MK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he came and took her by the hand, lifting her up; and she became well, and took care of their needs. </span>
<span class='v MK1_32' data-id='MK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And in the evening, at sundown, they took to him all who were diseased, and those who had evil spirits. </span>
<span class='v MK1_33' data-id='MK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And all the town had come together at the door. </span>
<span class='v MK1_34' data-id='MK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And a number, who were ill with different diseases, he made well, and sent out evil spirits; but he did not let the evil spirits say anything, because they had knowledge of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_35' data-id='MK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And in the morning, a long time before daylight, he got up and went out to a quiet place, and there he gave himself up to prayer. </span>
<span class='v MK1_36' data-id='MK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And Simon and those who were with him came after him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_37' data-id='MK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And when they came up with him, they said to him, Everyone is looking for you. </span>
<span class='v MK1_38' data-id='MK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, Let us go to other parts into the nearest towns, so that I may give teaching there, because for this purpose I came. </span>
<span class='v MK1_39' data-id='MK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And he went into their Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits. </span>
<span class='v MK1_40' data-id='MK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And a leper came to him and, going down on his knees before him, made a request, saying, If it is your pleasure, you have the power to make me clean. </span>
<span class='v MK1_41' data-id='MK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And being moved with pity, he put out his hand, and touching him said to him, It is my pleasure; be made clean. </span>
<span class='v MK1_42' data-id='MK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And straight away the disease went from him, and he was made clean. </span>
<span class='v MK1_43' data-id='MK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And he sent him away, saying to him very sharply, </span>
<span class='v MK1_44' data-id='MK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>See that you say nothing to any man: but go and let the priest see you, and make yourself clean by an offering of the things ordered by Moses, for a witness to them. </span>
<span class='v MK1_45' data-id='MK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But he went out, and made it public, giving an account of it everywhere, so that Jesus was no longer able to go openly into a town, but was outside in the waste land; and they came to him from every part. </span></div></div>
