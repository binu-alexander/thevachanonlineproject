<span class='v DT28_29' data-id='DT28_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>You will go feeling your way when the sun is high, like a blind man for whom all is dark, and nothing will go well for you: you will be crushed and made poor for ever, and you will have no saviour. </span>
<span class='v DT28_30' data-id='DT28_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>You will take a wife, but another man will have the use of her: the house which your hands have made will never be your resting-place: you will make a vine-garden, and never take the fruit of it. </span>
<span class='v DT28_31' data-id='DT28_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Your ox will be put to death before your eyes, but its flesh will not be your food: your ass will be violently taken away before your face, and will not be given back to you: your sheep will be given to your haters, and there will be no saviour for you. </span>
<span class='v DT28_32' data-id='DT28_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people, and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day: and you will have no power to do anything. </span>
<span class='v DT28_33' data-id='DT28_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The fruit of your land and all the work of your hands will be food for a nation which is strange to you and to your fathers; you will only be crushed down and kept under for ever: </span>
<span class='v DT28_34' data-id='DT28_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So that the things which your eyes have to see will send you out of your minds. </span>

<span class='v DT28_45' data-id='DT28_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And all these curses will come after you and overtake you, till your destruction is complete; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, or keep his laws and his orders which he gave you: </span>
<span class='v DT28_46' data-id='DT28_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>These things will come on you and on your seed, to be a sign and a wonder for ever; </span>
<span class='v DT28_47' data-id='DT28_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Because you did not give honour to the Lord your God, worshipping him gladly, with joy in your hearts on account of all your wealth of good things; </span>
<span class='v DT28_48' data-id='DT28_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>For this cause you will become servants to those whom the Lord your God will send against you, without food and drink and clothing, and in need of all things: and he will put a yoke of iron on your neck till he has put an end to you. </span>
<span class='v DT28_49' data-id='DT28_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The Lord will send a nation against you from the farthest ends of the earth, coming with the flight of an eagle; a nation whose language is strange to you; </span>
<span class='v DT28_50' data-id='DT28_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>A hard-faced nation, who will have no respect for the old or mercy for the young: </span>
<span class='v DT28_51' data-id='DT28_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>He will take the fruit of your cattle and of your land till death puts an end to you: he will let you have nothing of your grain or wine or oil or any of the increase of your cattle or the young of your flock, till he has made your destruction complete. </span>
<span class='v DT28_52' data-id='DT28_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Your towns will be shut in by his armies, till your high walls, in which you put your faith, have come down: his armies will be round your towns, through all your land which the Lord your God has given you. </span>
<span class='v DT28_53' data-id='DT28_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And your food will be the fruit of your body, the flesh of the sons and daughters which the Lord your God has given you; because of your bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters. </span>
<span class='v DT28_54' data-id='DT28_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>That man among you who is soft and used to comfort will be hard and cruel to his brother, and to his dear wife, and to of those his children who are still living; </span>
<span class='v DT28_55' data-id='DT28_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>And will not give to any of them the flesh of his children which will be his food because he has no other; in the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns. </span>
<span class='v DT28_56' data-id='DT28_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>The most soft and delicate of your women, who would not so much as put her foot on the earth, so delicate is she, will be hard-hearted to her husband and to her son and to her daughter; </span>
<span class='v DT28_57' data-id='DT28_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>And to her baby newly come to birth, and to the children of her body; for having no other food, she will make a meal of them secretly, because of her bitter need and the cruel grip of your haters on all your towns. </span>
<span class='v DT28_58' data-id='DT28_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>If you will not take care to do all the words of this law, recorded in this book, honouring that name of glory and of fear, THE LORD YOUR GOD; </span>
<span class='v DT28_59' data-id='DT28_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord your God will make your punishment, and the punishment of your seed, a thing to be wondered at; great punishments and cruel diseases stretching on through long years. </span>
<span class='v DT28_60' data-id='DT28_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>He will send on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which were a cause of fear to you, and they will take you in their grip. </span>
<span class='v DT28_61' data-id='DT28_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>And all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the Lord send on you till your destruction is complete. </span>
<span class='v DT28_62' data-id='DT28_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>And you will become a very small band, though your numbers were like the stars of heaven; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v DT28_63' data-id='DT28_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you, so the Lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction, and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage. </span>
<span class='v DT28_64' data-id='DT28_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will send you wandering among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other: there you will be servants to other gods, of wood and stone, gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge. </span>
<span class='v DT28_65' data-id='DT28_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And even among these nations there will be no peace for you, and no rest for your feet: but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul: </span>
<span class='v DT28_66' data-id='DT28_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>Your very life will be hanging in doubt before you, and day and night will be dark with fears, and nothing in life will be certain: </span>

<span class='v DT28_68' data-id='DT28_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will take you back to Egypt again in ships, by the way of which I said to you, You will never see it again: there you will be offering yourselves as men-servants and women-servants to your haters for a price, and no man will take you. </span></div></div>
