<span class='v DT28_30' data-id='DT28_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>You will take a wife, but another man will have the use of her: the house which your hands have made will never be your resting-place: you will make a vine-garden, and never take the fruit of it. </span>
<span class='v DT28_31' data-id='DT28_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Your ox will be put to death before your eyes, but its flesh will not be your food: your ass will be violently taken away before your face, and will not be given back to you: your sheep will be given to your haters, and there will be no saviour for you. </span>
<span class='v DT28_32' data-id='DT28_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people, and your eyes will be wasted away with looking and weeping for them all the day: and you will have no power to do anything. </span>

<span class='v DT28_58' data-id='DT28_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>If you will not take care to do all the words of this law, recorded in this book, honouring that name of glory and of fear, THE LORD YOUR GOD; </span>

<span class='v DT28_60' data-id='DT28_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>He will send on you again all the diseases of Egypt, which were a cause of fear to you, and they will take you in their grip. </span>
<span class='v DT28_61' data-id='DT28_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>And all the diseases and the pains not recorded in the book of this law will the Lord send on you till your destruction is complete. </span>
<span class='v DT28_62' data-id='DT28_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>And you will become a very small band, though your numbers were like the stars of heaven; because you did not give ear to the voice of the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v DT28_63' data-id='DT28_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>And as the Lord took delight in doing you good and increasing you, so the Lord will take pleasure in cutting you off and causing your destruction, and you will be uprooted from the land which you are about to take as your heritage. </span>
<span class='v DT28_64' data-id='DT28_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>And the Lord will send you wandering among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other: there you will be servants to other gods, of wood and stone, gods of which you and your fathers had no knowledge. </span>
<span class='v DT28_65' data-id='DT28_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>And even among these nations there will be no peace for you, and no rest for your feet: but the Lord will give you there a shaking heart and wasting eyes and weariness of soul: </span>
<span class='v DT28_66' data-id='DT28_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>Your very life will be hanging in doubt before you, and day and night will be dark with fears, and nothing in life will be certain: </span>
