<span class='v IS24_1' data-id='IS24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>See, the Lord is making the earth waste and unpeopled, he is turning it upside down, and sending the people in all directions. </span>
<span class='v IS24_2' data-id='IS24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And it will be the same for the people as for the priest; for the servant as for his master; and for the woman-servant as for her owner; the same for the one offering goods for a price as for him who takes them; the same for him who gives money at interest and for him who takes it; the same for him who lets others have the use of his property as for those who make use of it. </span>
<span class='v IS24_3' data-id='IS24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The earth will be completely waste and without men; for this is the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS24_4' data-id='IS24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The earth is sorrowing and wasting away, the world is full of grief and wasting away, the high ones of the earth come to nothing. </span>
<span class='v IS24_5' data-id='IS24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The earth has been made unclean by those living in it; because the laws have not been kept by them, the orders have been changed, and the eternal agreement has been broken. </span>
<span class='v IS24_6' data-id='IS24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this cause the earth is given up to the curse, and those in it are judged as sinners: for this cause those living on the earth are burned up, and the rest are small in number. </span>
<span class='v IS24_7' data-id='IS24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The new wine is thin, the vine is feeble, and all the glad-hearted make sounds of grief. </span>
<span class='v IS24_8' data-id='IS24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The pleasing sound of all instruments of music has come to an end, and the voices of those who are glad. </span>
<span class='v IS24_9' data-id='IS24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There is no more drinking of wine with a song; strong drink will be bitter to those who take it. </span>
<span class='v IS24_10' data-id='IS24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The town is waste and broken down: every house is shut up, so that no man may come in. </span>
<span class='v IS24_11' data-id='IS24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine; there is an end of all delight, the joy of the land is gone. </span>
<span class='v IS24_12' data-id='IS24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In the town all is waste, and in the public place is destruction. </span>
<span class='v IS24_13' data-id='IS24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it will be in the heart of the earth among the peoples, like the shaking of an olive-tree, as the last of the grapes after the getting-in is done. </span>
<span class='v IS24_14' data-id='IS24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But those will be making sounds of joy; they will be crying loudly from the sea for the glory of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v IS24_15' data-id='IS24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Give praise to the Lord in the east, to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, in the sea-lands. </span>
<span class='v IS24_16' data-id='IS24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>From the farthest part of the earth comes the sound of songs, glory to the upright. But I said, I am wasting away, wasting away, the curse is on me! The false ones go on in their false way, yes, they go on acting falsely. </span>
<span class='v IS24_17' data-id='IS24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Fear, and death, and the net, are come on you, O people of the earth. </span>
<span class='v IS24_18' data-id='IS24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And it will be that he who goes in flight from the sound of fear will be overtaken by death; and he who gets free from death will be taken in the net: for the windows on high are open, and the bases of the earth are shaking. </span>
<span class='v IS24_19' data-id='IS24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The earth is completely broken, it is parted in two, it is violently moved. </span>
<span class='v IS24_20' data-id='IS24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The earth will be moving uncertainly, like a man overcome by drink; it will be shaking like a tent; and the weight of its sin will be on it, crushing it down so that it will not get up again. </span>
<span class='v IS24_21' data-id='IS24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And in that day the Lord will send punishment on the army of the high ones on high, and on the kings of the earth on the earth. </span>
<span class='v IS24_22' data-id='IS24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they will be got together, like prisoners in the prison-house; and after a long time they will have their punishment. </span>
<span class='v IS24_23' data-id='IS24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then the moon will be veiled, and the sun put to shame; for the Lord of armies will be ruling in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before his judges he will let his glory be seen. </span></div></div>
