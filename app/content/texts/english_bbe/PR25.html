<span class='v PR25_6' data-id='PR25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not take glory for yourself before the king, and do not put yourself in the place of the great: </span>
<span class='v PR25_7' data-id='PR25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For it is better to have it said to you, Come up here; than for you to be put down in a lower place before the ruler. </span>
<span class='v PR25_8' data-id='PR25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Do not be quick to go to law about what you have seen, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbour has put you to shame? </span>
<span class='v PR25_9' data-id='PR25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Have a talk with your neighbour himself about your cause, but do not give away the secret of another: </span>
<span class='v PR25_10' data-id='PR25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Or your hearer may say evil of you, and your shame will not be turned away. </span>
<span class='v PR25_11' data-id='PR25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>A word at the right time is like apples of gold in a network of silver. </span>
<span class='v PR25_12' data-id='PR25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Like a nose-ring of gold and an ornament of the best gold, is a wise man who says sharp words to an ear ready to give attention. </span>
<span class='v PR25_13' data-id='PR25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As the cold of snow in the time of grain-cutting, so is a true servant to those who send him; for he gives new life to the soul of his master. </span>
<span class='v PR25_14' data-id='PR25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>As clouds and wind without rain, so is one who takes credit for an offering he has not given. </span>
<span class='v PR25_15' data-id='PR25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>A judge is moved by one who for a long time undergoes wrongs without protest, and by a soft tongue even bone is broken. </span>
<span class='v PR25_16' data-id='PR25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If you have honey, take only as much as is enough for you; for fear that, being full of it, you may not be able to keep it down. </span>
<span class='v PR25_17' data-id='PR25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let not your foot be frequently in your neighbour's house, or he may get tired of you, and his feeling be turned to hate. </span>

<span class='v PR25_20' data-id='PR25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Like one who takes off clothing in cold weather and like acid on a wound, is he who makes melody to a sad heart. </span>
<span class='v PR25_21' data-id='PR25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>If your hater is in need of food, give him bread; and if he is in need of drink, give him water: </span>
<span class='v PR25_22' data-id='PR25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For so you will put coals of fire on his head, and the Lord will give you your reward. </span>
<span class='v PR25_23' data-id='PR25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As the north wind gives birth to rain, so is an angry face caused by a tongue saying evil secretly. </span>
<span class='v PR25_24' data-id='PR25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>It is better to be living in an angle of the house-top, than with a bitter-tongued woman in a wide house. </span>
<span class='v PR25_25' data-id='PR25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As cold water to a tired soul, so is good news from a far country. </span>
<span class='v PR25_26' data-id='PR25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Like a troubled fountain and a dirty spring, is an upright man who has to give way before evil-doers. </span>
<span class='v PR25_27' data-id='PR25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>It is not good to take much honey: so he who is not looking for honour will be honoured. </span>
