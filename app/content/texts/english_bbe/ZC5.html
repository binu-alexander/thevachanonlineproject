<span class='v ZC5_1' data-id='ZC5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then again lifting up my eyes I saw a roll in flight through the air. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_2' data-id='ZC5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, A roll going through the air; it is twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_3' data-id='ZC5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, This is the curse which goes out over the face of all the land: for long enough has every thief gone without punishment, and long enough has every taker of false oaths gone without punishment. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_4' data-id='ZC5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will send it out, says the Lord of armies, and it will go into the house of the thief and into the house of him who takes a false oath by my name: and it will be in his house, causing its complete destruction, with its woodwork and its stones. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_5' data-id='ZC5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the angel who was talking to me went out and said to me, Let your eyes be lifted up now, and see the ephah which is going out. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_6' data-id='ZC5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah which is going out. And he said further, This is their evil-doing in all the land. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_7' data-id='ZC5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I saw a round cover of lead lifted up; and a woman was seated in the middle of the ephah. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_8' data-id='ZC5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said, This is Sin; and pushing her down into the ephah, he put the weight of lead on the mouth of it. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_9' data-id='ZC5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And lifting up my eyes I saw two women coming out, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they took the ephah, lifting it up between earth and heaven. </span>
<span class='v ZC5_10' data-id='ZC5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I said to the angel who was talking to me, Where are they taking the ephah? </span>
<span class='v ZC5_11' data-id='ZC5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, To make a house for her in the land of Shinar: and they will make a place ready, and put her there in the place which is hers. </span></div></div>
