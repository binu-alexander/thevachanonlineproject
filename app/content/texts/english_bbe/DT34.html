<span class='v DT34_2' data-id='DT34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, as far as the Great Sea of the west; </span>
<span class='v DT34_3' data-id='DT34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the South, and the circle of the valley of Jericho, the town of palm-trees, as far as Zoar. </span>
<span class='v DT34_4' data-id='DT34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to him, This is the land about which I made an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed: now I have let you see it with your eyes, but you will not go in there. </span>
<span class='v DT34_5' data-id='DT34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So death came to Moses, the servant of the Lord, there in the land of Moab, as the Lord had said. </span>

<span class='v DT34_7' data-id='DT34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Moses at his death was a hundred and twenty years old: his eye had not become clouded, or his natural force become feeble. </span>
<span class='v DT34_8' data-id='DT34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For thirty days the children of Israel were weeping for Moses in the table-lands of Moab, till the days of weeping and sorrow for Moses were ended. </span>
