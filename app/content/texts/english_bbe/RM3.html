<span class='v RM3_1' data-id='RM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>How then is the Jew better off? or what profit is there in circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM3_2' data-id='RM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Much in every way: first of all because the words of God were given to them. </span>
<span class='v RM3_3' data-id='RM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And if some have no faith, will that make the faith of God without effect? </span>
<span class='v RM3_4' data-id='RM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In no way: but let God be true, though every man is seen to be untrue; as it is said in the Writings, That your words may be seen to be true, and you may be seen to be right when you are judged. </span>
<span class='v RM3_5' data-id='RM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But if the righteousness of God is supported by our wrongdoing what is to be said? is it wrong for God to be angry (as men may say)? </span>
<span class='v RM3_6' data-id='RM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In no way: because if it is so, how is God able to be the judge of all the world? </span>
<span class='v RM3_7' data-id='RM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But if, because I am untrue, God being seen to be true gets more glory, why am I to be judged as a sinner? </span>
<span class='v RM3_8' data-id='RM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let us not do evil so that good may come (a statement which we are falsely said by some to have made), because such behaviour will have its right punishment. </span>
<span class='v RM3_9' data-id='RM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What then? are we worse off than they? In no way: because we have before made it clear that Jews as well as Greeks are all under the power of sin; </span>
<span class='v RM3_10' data-id='RM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>As it is said in the holy Writings, There is not one who does righteousness; </span>
<span class='v RM3_11' data-id='RM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Not one who has the knowledge of what is right, not one who is a searcher after God; </span>
<span class='v RM3_12' data-id='RM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They have all gone out of the way, there is no profit in any of them; there is not one who does good, not so much as one: </span>
<span class='v RM3_13' data-id='RM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Their throat is like an open place of death; with their tongues they have said what is not true: the poison of snakes is under their lips: </span>
<span class='v RM3_14' data-id='RM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Whose mouth is full of curses and bitter words: </span>
<span class='v RM3_15' data-id='RM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Their feet are quick in running after blood; </span>
<span class='v RM3_16' data-id='RM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Destruction and trouble are in their ways; </span>
<span class='v RM3_17' data-id='RM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And of the way of peace they have no knowledge: </span>
<span class='v RM3_18' data-id='RM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There is no fear of God before their eyes. </span>
<span class='v RM3_19' data-id='RM3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now, we have knowledge that what the law says is for those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all men may be judged by God: </span>
<span class='v RM3_20' data-id='RM3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Because by the works of the law no man is able to have righteousness in his eyes, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. </span>
<span class='v RM3_21' data-id='RM3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But now without the law there is a revelation of the righteousness of God, to which witness is given by the law and the prophets; </span>
<span class='v RM3_22' data-id='RM3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>That is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, to all those who have faith; and one man is not different from another, </span>
<span class='v RM3_23' data-id='RM3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For all have done wrong and are far from the glory of God; </span>
<span class='v RM3_24' data-id='RM3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they may have righteousness put to their credit, freely, by his grace, through the salvation which is in Christ Jesus: </span>
<span class='v RM3_25' data-id='RM3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Whom God has put forward as the sign of his mercy, through faith, by his blood, to make clear his righteousness when, in his pity, God let the sins of earlier times go without punishment; </span>
<span class='v RM3_26' data-id='RM3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And to make clear his righteousness now, so that he might himself be upright, and give righteousness to him who has faith in Jesus. </span>
<span class='v RM3_27' data-id='RM3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>What reason, then, is there for pride? It is shut out. By what sort of law? of works? No, but by a law of faith. </span>
<span class='v RM3_28' data-id='RM3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For this reason, then, a man may get righteousness by faith without the works of the law. </span>
<span class='v RM3_29' data-id='RM3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not in the same way the God of Gentiles? Yes, of Gentiles: </span>
<span class='v RM3_30' data-id='RM3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If God is one; and he will give righteousness because of faith to those who have circumcision, and through faith to those who have not circumcision. </span>
<span class='v RM3_31' data-id='RM3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Do we, then, through faith make the law of no effect? in no way: but we make it clear that the law is important. </span></div></div>
