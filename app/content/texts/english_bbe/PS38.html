<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_1' data-id='PS38_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>O Lord, be not bitter with me in your wrath; let not your hand be on me in the heat of your passion. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_2' data-id='PS38_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For your arrows have gone into my flesh, and I am crushed under the weight of your hand. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_3' data-id='PS38_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>My flesh is wasted because of your wrath; and there is no peace in my bones because of my sin. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_4' data-id='PS38_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For my crimes have gone over my head; they are like a great weight which is more than my strength. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_5' data-id='PS38_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>My wounds are poisoned and evil-smelling, because of my foolish behaviour. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_6' data-id='PS38_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am troubled, I am made low; I go weeping all the day. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_7' data-id='PS38_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For my body is full of burning; all my flesh is unhealthy. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_8' data-id='PS38_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I am feeble and crushed down; I gave a cry like a lion because of the grief in my heart. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_9' data-id='PS38_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Lord, all my desire is before you; my sorrow is not kept secret from you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_10' data-id='PS38_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>My heart goes out in pain, my strength is wasting away; as for the light of my eyes, it is gone from me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_11' data-id='PS38_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My lovers and my friends keep away from my disease; my relations keep far away. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_12' data-id='PS38_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Those who have a desire to take my life put nets for me; those who are designing my destruction say evil things against me, all the day their minds are full of deceit. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_13' data-id='PS38_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But I kept my ears shut like a man without hearing; like a man without a voice, never opening his mouth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_14' data-id='PS38_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So I was like a man whose ears are shut, and in whose mouth there are no sharp words. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_15' data-id='PS38_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>In you, O Lord, is my hope: you will give me an answer, O Lord, my God. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_16' data-id='PS38_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I said, Let them not be glad over me; when my foot is moved, let them not be lifted up with pride against me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_17' data-id='PS38_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>My feet are near to falling, and my sorrow is ever before me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_18' data-id='PS38_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will make clear my wrongdoing, with sorrow in my heart for my sin. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_19' data-id='PS38_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But they are strong who have hate for me without cause: those who are against me falsely are increased in numbers. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_20' data-id='PS38_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They give me back evil for good; they are my haters because I go after the thing which is right. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS38_21' data-id='PS38_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not give me up, O Lord; O my God, be near to me. </span></div>
