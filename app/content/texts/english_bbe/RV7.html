<span class='v RV7_1' data-id='RV7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth, keeping back the four winds in their hands, so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree. </span>
<span class='v RV7_2' data-id='RV7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the mark of the living God: and he said with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea, </span>
<span class='v RV7_3' data-id='RV7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do no damage to the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have put a mark on the servants of our God. </span>
<span class='v RV7_4' data-id='RV7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows, a hundred and forty-four thousand, who were marked out of every tribe of the people of Israel. </span>
<span class='v RV7_5' data-id='RV7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Of the tribe of Judah were marked twelve thousand: of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand: of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand: </span>

<span class='v RV7_9' data-id='RV7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After these things I saw a great army of people more than might be numbered, out of every nation and of all tribes and peoples and languages, taking their places before the high seat and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, and with branches in their hands, </span>
<span class='v RV7_10' data-id='RV7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Saying with a loud voice, Salvation to our God who is seated on the high seat, and to the Lamb. </span>
<span class='v RV7_11' data-id='RV7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And all the angels were round about the high seat, and about the rulers and the four beasts; and they went down on their faces before the high seat, and gave worship to God, saying, </span>
<span class='v RV7_12' data-id='RV7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So be it. Let blessing and glory and wisdom and praise and honour and power and strength be given to our God for ever and ever. So be it. </span>
<span class='v RV7_13' data-id='RV7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And one of the rulers made answer, saying to me, These who have on white robes, who are they, and where did they come from? </span>
<span class='v RV7_14' data-id='RV7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I said to him, My lord, you have knowledge. And he said to me, These are they who came through the great testing, and their robes have been washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb. </span>
<span class='v RV7_15' data-id='RV7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This is why they are before the high seat of God; and they are his servants day and night in his house: and he who is seated on the high seat will be a tent over them. </span>
<span class='v RV7_16' data-id='RV7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>They will never be in need of food or drink: and they will never again be troubled by the burning heat of the sun: </span>
<span class='v RV7_17' data-id='RV7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the Lamb who is on the high seat will be their keeper and their guide to fountains of living water: and God will make glad their eyes for ever. </span></div></div>
