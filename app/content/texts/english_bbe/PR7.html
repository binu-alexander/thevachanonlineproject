<span class='v PR7_1' data-id='PR7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My son, keep my sayings, and let my rules be stored up with you. </span>
<span class='v PR7_2' data-id='PR7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Keep my rules and you will have life; let my teaching be to you as the light of your eyes; </span>
<span class='v PR7_3' data-id='PR7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Let them be fixed to your fingers, and recorded in your heart. </span>
<span class='v PR7_4' data-id='PR7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Say to wisdom, You are my sister; let knowledge be named your special friend: </span>
<span class='v PR7_5' data-id='PR7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So that they may keep you from the strange woman, even from her whose words are smooth. </span>
<span class='v PR7_6' data-id='PR7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Looking out from my house, and watching through the window, </span>
<span class='v PR7_7' data-id='PR7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I saw among the young men one without sense, </span>
<span class='v PR7_8' data-id='PR7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Walking in the street near the turn of her road, going on the way to her house, </span>
<span class='v PR7_9' data-id='PR7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>At nightfall, in the evening of the day, in the black dark of the night. </span>
<span class='v PR7_10' data-id='PR7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the woman came out to him, in the dress of a loose woman, with a designing heart; </span>
<span class='v PR7_11' data-id='PR7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>She is full of noise and uncontrolled; her feet keep not in her house. </span>
<span class='v PR7_12' data-id='PR7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now she is in the street, now in the open spaces, waiting at every turning of the road. </span>
<span class='v PR7_13' data-id='PR7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So she took him by his hand, kissing him, and without a sign of shame she said to him: </span>
<span class='v PR7_14' data-id='PR7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I have a feast of peace-offerings, for today my oaths have been effected. </span>
<span class='v PR7_15' data-id='PR7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So I came out in the hope of meeting you, looking for you with care, and now I have you. </span>
<span class='v PR7_16' data-id='PR7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>My bed is covered with cushions of needlework, with coloured cloths of the cotton thread of Egypt; </span>
<span class='v PR7_17' data-id='PR7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I have made my bed sweet with perfumes and spices. </span>
<span class='v PR7_18' data-id='PR7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Come, let us take our pleasure in love till the morning, having joy in love's delights. </span>
<span class='v PR7_19' data-id='PR7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For the master of the house is away on a long journey: </span>
<span class='v PR7_20' data-id='PR7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He has taken a bag of money with him; he is coming back at the full moon. </span>
<span class='v PR7_21' data-id='PR7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>With her fair words she overcame him, forcing him with her smooth lips. </span>
<span class='v PR7_22' data-id='PR7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The simple man goes after her, like an ox going to its death, like a roe pulled by a cord; </span>
<span class='v PR7_23' data-id='PR7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Like a bird falling into a net; with no thought that his life is in danger, till an arrow goes into his side. </span>
<span class='v PR7_24' data-id='PR7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So now, my sons, give ear to me; give attention to the sayings of my mouth; </span>
<span class='v PR7_25' data-id='PR7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Let not your heart be turned to her ways, do not go wandering in her footsteps. </span>
<span class='v PR7_26' data-id='PR7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For those wounded and made low by her are great in number; and all those who have come to their death through her are a great army. </span>
<span class='v PR7_27' data-id='PR7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Her house is the way to the underworld, going down to the rooms of death. </span></div></div>
