<span class='v JB10_1' data-id='JB10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My soul is tired of life; I will let my sad thoughts go free in words; my soul will make a bitter outcry. </span>
<span class='v JB10_2' data-id='JB10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I will say to God, Do not put me down as a sinner; make clear to me what you have against me. </span>
<span class='v JB10_3' data-id='JB10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>What profit is it to you to be cruel, to give up the work of your hands, looking kindly on the design of evil-doers? </span>
<span class='v JB10_4' data-id='JB10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Have you eyes of flesh, or do you see as man sees? </span>
<span class='v JB10_5' data-id='JB10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Are your days as the days of man, or your years like his, </span>
<span class='v JB10_6' data-id='JB10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That you take note of my sin, searching after my wrongdoing, </span>
<span class='v JB10_7' data-id='JB10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Though you see that I am not an evil-doer; and there is no one who is able to take a man out of your hands? </span>
<span class='v JB10_8' data-id='JB10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Your hands made me, and I was formed by you, but then, changing your purpose, you gave me up to destruction. </span>
<span class='v JB10_9' data-id='JB10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>O keep in mind that you made me out of earth; and will you send me back again to dust? </span>
<span class='v JB10_10' data-id='JB10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Was I not drained out like milk, becoming hard like cheese? </span>
<span class='v JB10_11' data-id='JB10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>By you I was clothed with skin and flesh, and joined together with bones and muscles. </span>
<span class='v JB10_12' data-id='JB10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>You have been kind to me, and your grace has been with me, and your care has kept my spirit safe. </span>
<span class='v JB10_13' data-id='JB10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But you kept these things in the secret of your heart; I am certain this was in your thoughts: </span>
<span class='v JB10_14' data-id='JB10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>That, if I did wrong, you would take note of it, and would not make me clear from sin: </span>
<span class='v JB10_15' data-id='JB10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>That, if I was an evil-doer, the curse would come on me; and if I was upright, my head would not be lifted up, being full of shame and overcome with trouble. </span>
<span class='v JB10_16' data-id='JB10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And that if there was cause for pride, you would go after me like a lion; and again put out your wonders against me: </span>
<span class='v JB10_17' data-id='JB10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>That you would send new witnesses against me, increasing your wrath against me, and letting loose new armies on me. </span>
<span class='v JB10_18' data-id='JB10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Why then did you make me come out of my mother's body? It would have been better for me to have taken my last breath, and for no eye to have seen me, </span>
<span class='v JB10_19' data-id='JB10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And for me to have been as if I had not been; to have been taken from my mother's body straight to my last resting-place. </span>
<span class='v JB10_20' data-id='JB10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Are not the days of my life small in number? Let your eyes be turned away from me, so that I may have a little pleasure, </span>
<span class='v JB10_21' data-id='JB10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Before I go to the place from which I will not come back, to the land where all is dark and black, </span>
<span class='v JB10_22' data-id='JB10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>A land of thick dark, without order, where the very light is dark. </span></div></div>
