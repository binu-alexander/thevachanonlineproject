<span class='v PS78_1' data-id='PS78_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear, O my people, to my law; let your ears be bent down to the words of my mouth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_2' data-id='PS78_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Opening my mouth I will give out a story, even the dark sayings of old times; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_3' data-id='PS78_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Which have come to our hearing and our knowledge, as they were given to us by our fathers. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_4' data-id='PS78_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>We will not keep them secret from our children; we will make clear to the coming generation the praises of the Lord and his strength, and the great works of wonder which he has done. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_5' data-id='PS78_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He put up a witness in Jacob, and made a law in Israel; which he gave to our fathers so that they might give knowledge of them to their children; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_6' data-id='PS78_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So that the generation to come might have knowledge of them, even the children of the future, who would give word of them to their children; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_7' data-id='PS78_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So that they might put their hope in God, and not let God's works go out of their minds, but keep his laws; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_8' data-id='PS78_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And not be like their fathers, a stiff-necked and uncontrolled generation; a generation whose heart was hard, whose spirit was not true to God. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_9' data-id='PS78_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The children of Ephraim, armed with bows, were turned back on the day of the fight. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_10' data-id='PS78_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They were not ruled by God's word, and they would not go in the way of his law; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_11' data-id='PS78_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>They let his works go out of their memory, and the wonders which he had made them see. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_12' data-id='PS78_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He did great works before the eyes of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_13' data-id='PS78_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The sea was cut in two so that they might go through; the waters were massed together on this side and on that. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_14' data-id='PS78_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the daytime he was guiding them in the cloud, and all through the night with a light of fire. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_15' data-id='PS78_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The rocks of the waste land were broken by his power, and he gave them drink as out of the deep waters. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_16' data-id='PS78_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He made streams come out of the rock; and waters came flowing down like rivers. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_17' data-id='PS78_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they went on sinning against him even more, turning away from the Most High in the waste land; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_18' data-id='PS78_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Testing God in their hearts, requesting meat for their desire. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_19' data-id='PS78_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They said bitter words against God, saying, Is God able to make ready a table in the waste land? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_20' data-id='PS78_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>See, the rock was cut open by his power, so that the water came rushing out, and overflowing streams; is he able to give us bread? is he able to get meat for his people? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_21' data-id='PS78_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So these things came to the Lord's ears, and he was angry; and a fire was lighted against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_22' data-id='PS78_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Because they had no faith in God, and no hope in his salvation. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_23' data-id='PS78_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he gave orders to the clouds on high, and the doors of heaven were open; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_24' data-id='PS78_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And he sent down manna like rain for their food, and gave them the grain of heaven. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_25' data-id='PS78_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Man took part in the food of strong ones; he sent them meat in full measure. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_26' data-id='PS78_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>He sent an east wind from heaven, driving on the south wind by his power. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_27' data-id='PS78_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>He sent down meat on them like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the sea, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_28' data-id='PS78_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he let it come down into their resting-place, round about their tents. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_29' data-id='PS78_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So they had food and were full; for he gave them their desire; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_30' data-id='PS78_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But they were not turned from their desires; and while the food was still in their mouths, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_31' data-id='PS78_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The wrath of God came on them, and put to death the fattest of them, and put an end to the young men of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_32' data-id='PS78_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For all this they went on sinning even more, and had no faith in his great wonders. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_33' data-id='PS78_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So their days were wasted like a breath, and their years in trouble. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_34' data-id='PS78_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When he sent death on them, then they made search for him; turning to him and looking for him with care; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_35' data-id='PS78_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>In the memory that God was their Rock, and the Most High God their saviour. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_36' data-id='PS78_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But their lips were false to him, and their tongues were untrue to him; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_37' data-id='PS78_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And their hearts were not right with him, and they did not keep their agreement with him. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_38' data-id='PS78_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But he, being full of pity, has forgiveness for sin, and does not put an end to man: frequently turning back his wrath, and not being violently angry. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_39' data-id='PS78_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So he kept in mind that they were only flesh; a breath which is quickly gone, and will not come again. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_40' data-id='PS78_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>How frequently did they go against him in the waste land, and give him cause for grief in the dry places! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_41' data-id='PS78_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Again they put God to the test, and gave pain to the Holy One of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_42' data-id='PS78_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They did not keep in mind the work of his hand, or the day when he took them from the power of their haters; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_43' data-id='PS78_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>How he had done his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_44' data-id='PS78_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>So that their rivers were turned to blood, and they were not able to get drink from their streams. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_45' data-id='PS78_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>He sent different sorts of flies among them, poisoning their flesh; and frogs for their destruction. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_46' data-id='PS78_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>He gave the increase of their fields to worms, the fruits of their industry to the locusts. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_47' data-id='PS78_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>He sent ice for the destruction of their vines; their trees were damaged by the bitter cold. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_48' data-id='PS78_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>Ice was rained down on their cattle; thunderstorms sent destruction among the flocks. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_49' data-id='PS78_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>He sent on them the heat of his wrath, his bitter disgust, letting loose evil angels among them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_50' data-id='PS78_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>He let his wrath have its way; he did not keep back their soul from death, but gave their life to disease. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_51' data-id='PS78_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>He gave to destruction all the first sons of Egypt; the first-fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_52' data-id='PS78_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>But he took his people out like sheep, guiding them in the waste land like a flock. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_53' data-id='PS78_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>He took them on safely so that they had no fear; but their haters were covered by the sea. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_54' data-id='PS78_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>And he was their guide to his holy land, even to the mountain, which his right hand had made his; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_55' data-id='PS78_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Driving out nations before them, marking out the line of their heritage, and giving the people of Israel their tents for a resting-place. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_56' data-id='PS78_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>But they were bitter against the Most High God, testing him, and not keeping his laws; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_57' data-id='PS78_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Their hearts were turned back and untrue like their fathers; they were turned to one side like a twisted bow. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_58' data-id='PS78_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>They made him angry with their high places; moving him to wrath with their images. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_59' data-id='PS78_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>When this came to God's ears he was very angry, and gave up Israel completely; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_60' data-id='PS78_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>So that he went away from the holy place in Shiloh, the tent which he had put among men; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_61' data-id='PS78_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>And he let his strength be taken prisoner, and gave his glory into the hands of his hater. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_62' data-id='PS78_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>He gave his people up to the sword, and was angry with his heritage. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_63' data-id='PS78_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>Their young men were burned in the fire; and their virgins were not praised in the bride-song. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_64' data-id='PS78_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>Their priests were put to death by the sword, and their widows made no weeping for them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_65' data-id='PS78_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Then was the Lord like one awaking from sleep, and like a strong man crying out because of wine. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_66' data-id='PS78_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>His haters were turned back by his blows and shamed for ever. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_67' data-id='PS78_67'><span class='v-num v-67'>67&nbsp;</span>And he put the tent of Joseph on one side, and took not the tribe of Ephraim; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_68' data-id='PS78_68'><span class='v-num v-68'>68&nbsp;</span>But he took the tribe of Judah for himself, and the mountain of Zion, in which he had pleasure. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_69' data-id='PS78_69'><span class='v-num v-69'>69&nbsp;</span>And he made his holy place like the high heaven, like the earth which is fixed by him for ever. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_70' data-id='PS78_70'><span class='v-num v-70'>70&nbsp;</span>He took David to be his servant, taking him from the place of the flocks; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_71' data-id='PS78_71'><span class='v-num v-71'>71&nbsp;</span>From looking after the sheep which were giving milk, he took him to give food to Jacob his people, and to Israel his heritage. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS78_72' data-id='PS78_72'><span class='v-num v-72'>72&nbsp;</span>So he gave them food with an upright heart, guiding them by the wisdom of his hands. </span></div></div>
