<span class='v C18_1' data-id='C18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now about things offered to images: we all seem to ourselves to have knowledge. Knowledge gives pride, but love gives true strength. </span>
<span class='v C18_2' data-id='C18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If anyone seems to himself to have knowledge, so far he has not the right sort of knowledge about anything; </span>
<span class='v C18_3' data-id='C18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But if anyone has love for God, God has knowledge of him. </span>
<span class='v C18_4' data-id='C18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So, then, as to the question of taking food offered to images, we are certain that an image is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one. </span>
<span class='v C18_5' data-id='C18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For though there are those who have the name of gods, in heaven or on earth, as there are a number of gods and a number of lords, </span>
<span class='v C18_6' data-id='C18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There is for us only one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we are for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we have our being through him. </span>
<span class='v C18_7' data-id='C18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Still, all men have not that knowledge: but some, being used till now to the image, are conscious that they are taking food which has been offered to the image; and because they are not strong in the faith, their minds are troubled. </span>
<span class='v C18_8' data-id='C18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But God's approval of us is not based on the food we take: if we do not take it we are no worse for it; and if we take it we are no better. </span>
<span class='v C18_9' data-id='C18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But take care that this power of yours does not give cause for trouble to the feeble. </span>
<span class='v C18_10' data-id='C18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, taking food as a guest in the house of an image, will it not give him, if he is feeble, the idea that he may take food offered to images? </span>
<span class='v C18_11' data-id='C18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And so, through your knowledge, you are the cause of destruction to your brother, for whom Christ underwent death. </span>
<span class='v C18_12' data-id='C18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And in this way, doing evil to the brothers, and causing trouble to those whose faith is feeble, you are sinning against Christ. </span>
<span class='v C18_13' data-id='C18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this reason, if food is a cause of trouble to my brother, I will give up taking meat for ever, so that I may not be a cause of trouble to my brother. </span></div></div>
