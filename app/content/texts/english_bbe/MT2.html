<span class='v MT2_1' data-id='MT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when the birth of Jesus took place in Beth-lehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v MT2_2' data-id='MT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Saying, Where is the King of the Jews whose birth has now taken place? We have seen his star in the east and have come to give him worship. </span>
<span class='v MT2_3' data-id='MT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And when it came to the ears of Herod the king, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. </span>
<span class='v MT2_4' data-id='MT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he got together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, questioning them as to where the birth-place of the Christ would be. </span>
<span class='v MT2_5' data-id='MT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, In Beth-lehem of Judaea; for so it is said in the writings of the prophet, </span>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>You Beth-lehem, in the land of Judah, are not the least among the chiefs of Judah: out of you will come a ruler, who will be the keeper of my people Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT2_7' data-id='MT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Herod sent for the wise men privately, and put questions to them about what time the star had been seen. </span>
<span class='v MT2_8' data-id='MT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he sent them to Beth-lehem and said, Go and make certain where the young child is; and when you have seen him, let me have news of it, so that I may come and give him worship. </span>
<span class='v MT2_9' data-id='MT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And after hearing the king, they went on their way; and the star which they saw in the east went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the young child was. </span>
<span class='v MT2_10' data-id='MT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And when they saw the star they were full of joy. </span>
<span class='v MT2_11' data-id='MT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they came into the house, and saw the young child with Mary, his mother; and falling down on their faces they gave him worship; and from their store they gave him offerings of gold, perfume, and spices. </span>
<span class='v MT2_12' data-id='MT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And it was made clear to them by God in a dream that they were not to go back to Herod; so they went into their country by another way. </span>
<span class='v MT2_13' data-id='MT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And when they had gone, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream, saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into Egypt, and do not go from there till I give you word; for Herod will be searching for the young child to put him to death. </span>
<span class='v MT2_14' data-id='MT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So he took the young child and his mother by night, and went into Egypt; </span>
<span class='v MT2_15' data-id='MT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And was there till the death of Herod; so that the word of the Lord through the prophet might come true, Out of Egypt have I sent for my son. </span>
<span class='v MT2_16' data-id='MT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was very angry; and he sent out, and put to death all the male children in Beth-lehem and in all the parts round about it, from two years old and under, acting on the knowledge which he had got with care from the wise men. </span>
<span class='v MT2_17' data-id='MT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the word of Jeremiah the prophet came true, </span>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In Ramah there was a sound of weeping and great sorrow, Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted for their loss. </span>
<span class='v MT2_19' data-id='MT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord came in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, </span>
<span class='v MT2_20' data-id='MT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Saying, Get up and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: because they who were attempting to take the young child's life are dead. </span>
<span class='v MT2_21' data-id='MT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he got up, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT2_22' data-id='MT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But when it came to his ears that Archelaus was ruling over Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was in fear of going there; and God having given him news of the danger in a dream, he went out of the way into the country parts of Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MT2_23' data-id='MT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he came and was living in a town named Nazareth: so that the word of the prophets might come true, He will be named a Nazarene. </span></div></div>
