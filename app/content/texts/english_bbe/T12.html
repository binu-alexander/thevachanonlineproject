<span class='v T12_1' data-id='T12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My desire is, first of all, that you will make requests and prayers and give praise for all men; </span>
<span class='v T12_2' data-id='T12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For kings and all those in authority; so that we may have a calm and quiet life in all fear of God and serious behaviour. </span>
<span class='v T12_3' data-id='T12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is good and pleasing in the eyes of God our Saviour; </span>
<span class='v T12_4' data-id='T12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Whose desire is that all men may have salvation and come to the knowledge of what is true. </span>
<span class='v T12_5' data-id='T12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For there is one God and one peacemaker between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v T12_6' data-id='T12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Who gave himself as an offering for all; witness of which was to be given at the right time; </span>
<span class='v T12_7' data-id='T12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And of this I became a preacher and an Apostle (what I say is true, not false,) and a teacher of the Gentiles in the true faith. </span>
<span class='v T12_8' data-id='T12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>It is my desire, then, that in every place men may give themselves to prayer, lifting up holy hands, without wrath or argument. </span>
<span class='v T12_9' data-id='T12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And that women may be dressed in simple clothing, with a quiet and serious air; not with twisted hair and gold or jewels or robes of great price; </span>
<span class='v T12_10' data-id='T12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But clothed with good works, as is right for women who are living in the fear of God. </span>
<span class='v T12_11' data-id='T12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let a woman quietly take the place of a learner and be under authority. </span>
<span class='v T12_12' data-id='T12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In my opinion it is right for a woman not to be a teacher, or to have rule over a man, but to be quiet. </span>
<span class='v T12_13' data-id='T12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For Adam was first formed, then Eve; </span>
<span class='v T12_14' data-id='T12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Adam was not taken by deceit, but the woman, being tricked, became a wrongdoer. </span>
<span class='v T12_15' data-id='T12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if they go on in faith and love and holy self-control, she will be kept safe at the time of childbirth. </span></div></div>
