<span class='v C211_1' data-id='C211_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Put up with me if I am a little foolish: but, truly, you do put up with me. </span>
<span class='v C211_2' data-id='C211_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For I have a very great care for you: because you have been married by me to one husband, and it is my desire to give you completely holy to Christ. </span>
<span class='v C211_3' data-id='C211_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I have a fear, that in some way, as Eve was tricked by the deceit of the snake, your minds may be turned away from their simple and holy love for Christ. </span>
<span class='v C211_4' data-id='C211_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For if anyone comes preaching another Jesus from the one whose preachers we are, or if you have got a different spirit, or a different sort of good news from those which came to you, how well you put up with these things. </span>
<span class='v C211_5' data-id='C211_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For in my opinion, I am in no way less than the most important of the Apostles. </span>
<span class='v C211_6' data-id='C211_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But though I am rough in my way of talking, I am not so in knowledge, as we have made clear to all by our acts among you. </span>
<span class='v C211_7' data-id='C211_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Or did I do wrong in making myself low so that you might be lifted up, because I gave you the good news of God without reward? </span>
<span class='v C211_8' data-id='C211_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I took money from other churches as payment for my work, so that I might be your servant; </span>
<span class='v C211_9' data-id='C211_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when I was present with you, and was in need, I let no man be responsible for me; for the brothers, when they came from Macedonia, gave me whatever was needed; and in everything I kept myself from being a trouble to you, and I will go on doing so. </span>
<span class='v C211_10' data-id='C211_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>As the true word of Christ is in me, I will let no man take from me this my cause of pride in the country of Achaia. </span>
<span class='v C211_11' data-id='C211_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Why? because I have no love for you? let God be judge. </span>
<span class='v C211_12' data-id='C211_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But what I do, that I will go on doing, so that I may give no chance to those who are looking for one; so that, in the cause of their pride, they may be seen to be the same as we are. </span>
<span class='v C211_13' data-id='C211_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For such men are false Apostles, workers of deceit, making themselves seem like Apostles of Christ. </span>
<span class='v C211_14' data-id='C211_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And it is no wonder; for even Satan himself is able to take the form of an angel of light. </span>
<span class='v C211_15' data-id='C211_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So it is no great thing if his servants make themselves seem to be servants of righteousness; whose end will be the reward of their works. </span>
<span class='v C211_16' data-id='C211_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I say again, Let me not seem foolish to anyone; but if I do, put up with me as such, so that I may take a little glory to myself. </span>
<span class='v C211_17' data-id='C211_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>What I am now saying is not by the order of the Lord, but as a foolish person, taking credit to myself, as it seems. </span>
<span class='v C211_18' data-id='C211_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Seeing that there are those who take credit to themselves after the flesh, I will do the same. </span>
<span class='v C211_19' data-id='C211_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For you put up with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves. </span>
<span class='v C211_20' data-id='C211_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You put up with a man if he makes servants of you, if he makes profit out of you, if he makes you prisoners, if he puts himself in a high place, if he gives you blows on the face. </span>
<span class='v C211_21' data-id='C211_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I say this by way of shaming ourselves, as if we had been feeble. But if anyone puts himself forward (I am talking like a foolish person), I will do the same. </span>
<span class='v C211_22' data-id='C211_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they of Israel? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I. </span>
<span class='v C211_23' data-id='C211_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking foolishly) I am more so; I have had more experience of hard work, of prisons, of blows more than measure, of death. </span>
<span class='v C211_24' data-id='C211_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Five times the Jews gave me forty blows but one. </span>
<span class='v C211_25' data-id='C211_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Three times I was whipped with rods, once I was stoned, three times the ship I was in came to destruction at sea, a night and a day I have been in the water; </span>
<span class='v C211_26' data-id='C211_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In frequent travels, in dangers on rivers, in dangers from outlaws, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the town, in dangers in the waste land, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brothers; </span>
<span class='v C211_27' data-id='C211_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>In hard work and weariness, in frequent watchings, going without food and drink, cold and in need of clothing. </span>
<span class='v C211_28' data-id='C211_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In addition to all the other things, there is that which comes on me every day, the care of all the churches. </span>
<span class='v C211_29' data-id='C211_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Who is feeble and I am not feeble? who is in danger of falling, and I am not angry? </span>
<span class='v C211_30' data-id='C211_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If I have to take credit to myself, I will do so in the things in which I am feeble. </span>
<span class='v C211_31' data-id='C211_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be praise for ever, is witness that the things which I say are true. </span>
<span class='v C211_32' data-id='C211_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>In Damascus, the ruler under Aretas the king kept watch over the town of the people of Damascus, in order to take me: </span>
<span class='v C211_33' data-id='C211_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And being let down in a basket from the wall through a window, I got free from his hands. </span></div></div>
