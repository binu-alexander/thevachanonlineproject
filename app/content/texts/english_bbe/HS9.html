<span class='v HS9_1' data-id='HS9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Have no joy, O Israel, and do not be glad like the nations; for you have been untrue to your God; your desire has been for the loose woman's reward on every grain-floor. </span>
<span class='v HS9_2' data-id='HS9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The grain-floor and the place where the grapes are crushed will not give them food; there will be no new wine for them. </span>
<span class='v HS9_3' data-id='HS9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They will have no resting-place in the Lord's land, but Ephraim will go back to Egypt, and they will take unclean food in Assyria. </span>
<span class='v HS9_4' data-id='HS9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They will give no wine offering to the Lord, they will not make offerings ready for him; their bread will be like the bread of those in sorrow; all who take it will be unclean, because their bread will be only for their desire, it will not come into the house of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HS9_5' data-id='HS9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>What will you do on the day of worship, and on the day of the feast of the Lord? </span>
<span class='v HS9_6' data-id='HS9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For see, they are going away into Assyria; Egypt will get them together, Memphis will be their last resting-place; their fair silver vessels will be covered over with field plants, and thorns will come up in their tents. </span>
<span class='v HS9_7' data-id='HS9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The days of punishment, the days of reward are come; Israel will be put to shame; the prophet is foolish, the man who has the spirit is off his head, because of your great sin. </span>
<span class='v HS9_8' data-id='HS9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>There is great hate against the watchman of Ephraim, the people of my God; as for the prophet, there is a net in all his ways, and hate in the house of his God. </span>
<span class='v HS9_9' data-id='HS9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They have gone deep in evil as in the days of Gibeah; he will keep in mind their wrongdoing, he will give them punishment for their sins. </span>
<span class='v HS9_10' data-id='HS9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I made discovery of Israel as of grapes in the waste land; I saw your fathers as the first-fruits of the fig-tree in her early fruit time; but they came to Baal-peor, and made themselves holy to the thing of shame, and became disgusting like that to which they gave their love. </span>
<span class='v HS9_11' data-id='HS9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As for Ephraim, their glory will go in flight like a bird: there will be no birth and no one with child and no giving of life. </span>
<span class='v HS9_12' data-id='HS9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Even though their children have come to growth I will take them away, so that not a man will be there; for their evil-doing will be complete and they will be put to shame because of it. </span>
<span class='v HS9_13' data-id='HS9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As I have seen a beast whose young have been taken from her, so Ephraim will give birth to children only for them to be put to death. </span>
<span class='v HS9_14' data-id='HS9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>O Lord, what will you give them? Give them bodies which may not give birth and breasts without milk. </span>
<span class='v HS9_15' data-id='HS9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All their evil-doing is in Gilgal; there I had hate for them; because of their evil-doing I will send them out of my house; they will no longer be dear to me; all their rulers are uncontrolled. </span>
<span class='v HS9_16' data-id='HS9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The rod has come on Ephraim, their root is dry, let them have no fruit; even though they give birth, I will put to death the dearest fruit of their bodies. </span>
<span class='v HS9_17' data-id='HS9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>My God will give them up because they did not give ear to him; they will be wandering among the nations. </span></div></div>
