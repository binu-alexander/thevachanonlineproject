<span class='v RV1_5' data-id='RV1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And from Jesus Christ, the true witness, the first to come back from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood; </span>

<span class='v RV1_10' data-id='RV1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and a great voice at my back, as of a horn, came to my ears, </span>
<span class='v RV1_11' data-id='RV1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Saying, What you see, put in a book, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. </span>
<span class='v RV1_12' data-id='RV1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And turning to see the voice which said these words to me, I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them; </span>
<span class='v RV1_13' data-id='RV1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And in the middle of them one like a son of man, clothed with a robe down to his feet, and with a band of gold round his breasts. </span>
<span class='v RV1_14' data-id='RV1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And his head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; </span>
<span class='v RV1_15' data-id='RV1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And his feet like polished brass, as if it had been burned in a fire; and his voice was as the sound of great waters. </span>
<span class='v RV1_16' data-id='RV1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword: and his face was like the sun shining in its strength. </span>
<span class='v RV1_17' data-id='RV1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when I saw him, I went down on my face at his feet as one dead. And he put his right hand on me, saying, Have no fear; I am the first and the last and the Living one; </span>
<span class='v RV1_18' data-id='RV1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And I was dead, and see, I am living for ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hell. </span>
<span class='v RV1_19' data-id='RV1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Put in writing, then, the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will be after these; </span>
<span class='v RV1_20' data-id='RV1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights.
