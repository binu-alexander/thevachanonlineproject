<span class='v IS38_3' data-id='IS38_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>O Lord, keep in mind how I have been true to you with all my heart, and have done what is good in your eyes. And Hezekiah gave way to bitter weeping. </span>
<span class='v IS38_4' data-id='IS38_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS38_5' data-id='IS38_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Go to Hezekiah, and say, The Lord, the God of David, your father, says, Your prayer has come to my ears, and I have seen your weeping: see, I will give you fifteen more years of life. </span>
<span class='v IS38_6' data-id='IS38_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will keep you and this town safe from the hands of the king of Assyria: and I will keep watch over this town. </span>
<span class='v IS38_7' data-id='IS38_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah said, This is the sign the Lord will give you, that he will do what he has said: </span>
<span class='v IS38_8' data-id='IS38_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>See, I will make the shade which has gone down on the steps of Ahaz with the sun, go back ten steps. So the shade went back the ten steps by which it had gone down. </span>
<span class='v IS38_9' data-id='IS38_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The writing of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after he had been ill, and had got better from his disease. </span>
<span class='v IS38_10' data-id='IS38_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I said, In the quiet of my days I am going down into the underworld: the rest of my years are being taken away from me. </span>
<span class='v IS38_11' data-id='IS38_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I said, I will not see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of the living: I will not see man again or those living in the world. </span>
<span class='v IS38_12' data-id='IS38_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>My resting-place is pulled up and taken away from me like a herdsman's tent: my life is rolled up like a linen-worker's thread; I am cut off from the cloth on the frame: from day even to night you give me up to pain. </span>
<span class='v IS38_13' data-id='IS38_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I am crying out with pain till the morning; it is as if a lion was crushing all my bones. </span>
<span class='v IS38_14' data-id='IS38_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I make cries like a bird; I give out sounds of grief like a dove: my eyes are looking up with desire; O Lord, I am crushed, take up my cause. </span>
<span class='v IS38_15' data-id='IS38_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What am I to say? seeing that it is he who has done it: all my time of sleeping I am turning from side to side without rest. </span>

<span class='v IS38_18' data-id='IS38_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For the underworld is not able to give you praise, death gives you no honour: for those who go down into the underworld there is no hope in your mercy. </span>
<span class='v IS38_19' data-id='IS38_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The living, the living man, he will give you praise, as I do this day: the father will give the story of your mercy to his children. </span>
<span class='v IS38_20' data-id='IS38_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>O Lord, quickly be my saviour; so we will make my songs to corded instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord. </span>
