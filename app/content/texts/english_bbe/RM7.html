<span class='v RM7_1' data-id='RM7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Is it not clear, my brothers (I am using an argument to those who have knowledge of the law), that the law has power over a man as long as he is living? </span>
<span class='v RM7_2' data-id='RM7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For the woman who has a husband is placed by the law under the power of her husband as long as he is living; but if her husband is dead, she is free from the law of the husband. </span>
<span class='v RM7_3' data-id='RM7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So if, while the husband is living, she is joined to another man, she will get the name of one who is untrue to her husband: but if the husband is dead, she is free from the law, so that she is not untrue, even if she takes another man. </span>
<span class='v RM7_4' data-id='RM7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In the same way, my brothers, you were made dead to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, even to him who came again from the dead, so that we might give fruit to God. </span>
<span class='v RM7_5' data-id='RM7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For when we were in the flesh, the evil passions which came into being through the law were working in our bodies to give the fruit of death. </span>
<span class='v RM7_6' data-id='RM7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But now we are free from the law, having been made dead to that which had power over us; so that we are servants in the new way of the spirit, not in the old way of the letter. </span>
<span class='v RM7_7' data-id='RM7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>What then is to be said? is the law sin? in no way. But I would not have had knowledge of sin but for the law: for I would not have been conscious of desire if the law had not said, You may not have a desire for what is another's. </span>
<span class='v RM7_8' data-id='RM7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But sin, taking its chance through that which was ordered by the law, was working in me every form of desire: because without the law sin is dead. </span>
<span class='v RM7_9' data-id='RM7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And there was a time when I was living without the law: but when the law gave its orders, sin came to life and put me to death; </span>
<span class='v RM7_10' data-id='RM7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I made the discovery that the law whose purpose was to give life had become a cause of death: </span>
<span class='v RM7_11' data-id='RM7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For I was tricked and put to death by sin, which took its chance through the law. </span>
<span class='v RM7_12' data-id='RM7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the law is holy, and its orders are holy, upright, and good. </span>
<span class='v RM7_13' data-id='RM7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Was then that which is good, death to me? In no way. But the purpose was that sin might be seen to be sin by working death to me through that which is good; so that through the orders of the law sin might seem much more evil. </span>
<span class='v RM7_14' data-id='RM7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For we are conscious that the law is of the spirit; but I am of the flesh, given into the power of sin. </span>
<span class='v RM7_15' data-id='RM7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And I have no clear knowledge of what I am doing, for that which I have a mind to do, I do not, but what I have hate for, that I do. </span>
<span class='v RM7_16' data-id='RM7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But, if I do that which I have no mind to do, I am in agreement with the law that the law is good. </span>
<span class='v RM7_17' data-id='RM7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. </span>
<span class='v RM7_18' data-id='RM7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For I am conscious that in me, that is, in my flesh, there is nothing good: I have the mind but not the power to do what is right. </span>
<span class='v RM7_19' data-id='RM7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For the good which I have a mind to do, I do not: but the evil which I have no mind to do, that I do. </span>
<span class='v RM7_20' data-id='RM7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But if I do what I have no mind to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin living in me. </span>
<span class='v RM7_21' data-id='RM7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So I see a law that, though I have a mind to do good, evil is present in me. </span>
<span class='v RM7_22' data-id='RM7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In my heart I take pleasure in the law of God, </span>
<span class='v RM7_23' data-id='RM7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But I see another law in my body, working against the law of my mind, and making me the servant of the law of sin which is in my flesh. </span>
<span class='v RM7_24' data-id='RM7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>How unhappy am I! who will make me free from the body of this death? </span>
<span class='v RM7_25' data-id='RM7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I give praise to God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So with my mind I am a servant to the law of God, but with my flesh to the law of sin. </span></div></div>
