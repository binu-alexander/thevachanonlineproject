<span class='v GN26_1' data-id='GN26_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then came a time of great need in the land, like that which had been before in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar. </span>
<span class='v GN26_2' data-id='GN26_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Lord came to him in a vision and said, Do not go down to Egypt; keep in the land of which I will give you knowledge: </span>
<span class='v GN26_3' data-id='GN26_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Keep in this land, and I will be with you and give you my blessing; for to you and to your seed will I give all these lands, giving effect to the oath which I made to your father Abraham; </span>
<span class='v GN26_4' data-id='GN26_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will make your seed like the stars of heaven in number, and will give them all these lands, and your seed will be a blessing to all the nations of the earth; </span>
<span class='v GN26_5' data-id='GN26_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Because Abraham gave ear to my voice and kept my words, my rules, my orders, and my laws. </span>
<span class='v GN26_6' data-id='GN26_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Isaac went on living in Gerar; </span>
<span class='v GN26_7' data-id='GN26_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when he was questioned by the men of the place about his wife, he said, She is my sister; fearing to say, She is my wife; for, he said, the men of the place may put me to death on account of Rebekah; because she is very beautiful. </span>
<span class='v GN26_8' data-id='GN26_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when he had been there for some time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking through a window, saw Isaac playing with Rebekah his wife. </span>
<span class='v GN26_9' data-id='GN26_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said to Isaac, It is clear that she is your wife: why then did you say, She is my sister? And Isaac said, For fear that I might be put to death because of her. </span>
<span class='v GN26_10' data-id='GN26_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Abimelech said, What have you done to us? one of the people might well have had connection with your wife, and the sin would have been ours. </span>
<span class='v GN26_11' data-id='GN26_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech gave orders to his people that anyone touching Isaac or his wife was to be put to death. </span>
<span class='v GN26_12' data-id='GN26_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac, planting seed in that land, got in the same year fruit a hundred times as much, for the blessing of the Lord was on him. </span>
<span class='v GN26_13' data-id='GN26_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And his wealth became very great, increasing more and more; </span>
<span class='v GN26_14' data-id='GN26_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For he had great wealth of flocks and herds and great numbers of servants; so that the Philistines were full of envy. </span>
<span class='v GN26_15' data-id='GN26_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now all the water-holes, which his father's servants had made in the days of Abraham, had been stopped up with earth by the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v GN26_16' data-id='GN26_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go away from us, for you are stronger than we are. </span>
<span class='v GN26_17' data-id='GN26_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So Isaac went away from there, and put up his tents in the valley of Gerar, making his living-place there. </span>
<span class='v GN26_18' data-id='GN26_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he made again the water-holes which had been made in the days of Abraham his father, and which had been stopped up by the Philistines; and he gave them the names which his father had given them. </span>
<span class='v GN26_19' data-id='GN26_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now Isaac's servants made holes in the valley, and came to a spring of flowing water. </span>
<span class='v GN26_20' data-id='GN26_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the herdmen of Gerar had a fight with Isaac's herdmen, for they said, The spring is ours: so he gave the spring the name of Esek, because there was a fight about it. </span>
<span class='v GN26_21' data-id='GN26_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then they made another water-hole, and there was a fight about that, so he gave it the name of Sitnah. </span>
<span class='v GN26_22' data-id='GN26_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then he went away from there, and made another water-hole, about which there was no fighting: so he gave it the name of Rehoboth, for he said, Now the Lord has made room for us, and we will have fruit in this land. </span>
<span class='v GN26_23' data-id='GN26_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And from there he went on to Beer-sheba. </span>
<span class='v GN26_24' data-id='GN26_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>That night the Lord came to him in a vision, and said, I am the God of your father Abraham: have no fear for I am with you, blessing you, and your seed will be increased because of my servant Abraham. </span>
<span class='v GN26_25' data-id='GN26_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then he made an altar there, and gave worship to the name of the Lord, and he put up his tents there, and there his servants made a water-hole. </span>
<span class='v GN26_26' data-id='GN26_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech had come to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol, the captain of his army. </span>
<span class='v GN26_27' data-id='GN26_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Isaac said to them, Why have you come to me, seeing that in your hate for me you sent me away from you? </span>
<span class='v GN26_28' data-id='GN26_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they said, We saw clearly that the Lord was with you: so we said, Let there be an oath between us and you, and let us make an agreement with you; </span>
<span class='v GN26_29' data-id='GN26_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>That you will do us no damage, even as we put no hand on you, and did you nothing but good, and sent you away in peace: and now the blessing of the Lord is on you. </span>
<span class='v GN26_30' data-id='GN26_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then he made a feast for them, and they all had food and drink. </span>
<span class='v GN26_31' data-id='GN26_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And early in the morning they took an oath one to the other: then Isaac sent them away and they went on their way in peace. </span>
<span class='v GN26_32' data-id='GN26_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And that day Isaac's servants came to him and gave him word of the water-hole which they had made, and said to him, We have come to water. </span>
<span class='v GN26_33' data-id='GN26_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he gave it the name of Shibah: so the name of that town is Beer-sheba to this day. </span>
<span class='v GN26_34' data-id='GN26_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And when Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite: </span>
<span class='v GN26_35' data-id='GN26_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And Isaac and Rebekah had grief of mind because of them. </span></div></div>
