<span class='v EK3_1' data-id='EK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, take this roll for your food, and go and say my words to the children of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK3_2' data-id='EK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And, on my opening my mouth, he made me take the roll as food. </span>
<span class='v EK3_3' data-id='EK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, let your stomach make a meal of it and let your inside be full of this roll which I am giving you. Then I took it, and it was sweet as honey in my mouth. </span>
<span class='v EK3_4' data-id='EK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, go now to the children of Israel, and say my words to them. </span>
<span class='v EK3_5' data-id='EK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For you are not sent to a people whose talk is strange and whose language is hard, but to the children of Israel; </span>
<span class='v EK3_6' data-id='EK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Not to a number of peoples whose talk is strange and whose language is hard and whose words are not clear to you. Truly, if I sent you to them they would give ear to you. </span>
<span class='v EK3_7' data-id='EK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But the children of Israel will not give ear to you; for they have no mind to give ear to me: for all the children of Israel have a hard brow and a stiff heart. </span>
<span class='v EK3_8' data-id='EK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>See, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your brow hard against their brows. </span>
<span class='v EK3_9' data-id='EK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Like a diamond harder than rock I have made your brow: have no fear of them and do not be overcome by their looks, for they are an uncontrolled people. </span>
<span class='v EK3_10' data-id='EK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, Son of man, take into your heart all my words which I am about to say to you, and let your ears be open to them. </span>
<span class='v EK3_11' data-id='EK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And go now to those who have been taken away as prisoners, to the children of your people, and say to them, This is what the Lord has said; if they give ear or if they do not. </span>
<span class='v EK3_12' data-id='EK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then I was lifted up by the wind, and at my back the sound of a great rushing came to my ears when the glory of the Lord was lifted up from his place. </span>
<span class='v EK3_13' data-id='EK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And there was the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels at their side, the sound of a great rushing. </span>
<span class='v EK3_14' data-id='EK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the wind, lifting me up, took me away: and I went in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong on me. </span>
<span class='v EK3_15' data-id='EK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then I came to those who had been taken away as prisoners, who were at Telabib by the river Chebar, and I was seated among them full of wonder for seven days. </span>
<span class='v EK3_16' data-id='EK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And at the end of seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK3_17' data-id='EK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the children of Israel: so give ear to the word of my mouth, and give them word from me of their danger. </span>
<span class='v EK3_18' data-id='EK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When I say to the evil-doer, Death will certainly be your fate; and you give him no word of it and say nothing to make clear to the evil-doer the danger of his evil way, so that he may be safe; that same evil man will come to death in his evil-doing; but I will make you responsible for his blood. </span>
<span class='v EK3_19' data-id='EK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But if you give the evil-doer word of his danger, and he is not turned from his sin or from his evil way, death will overtake him in his evil-doing; but your life will be safe. </span>
<span class='v EK3_20' data-id='EK3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Again, when an upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, and I put a cause of falling in his way, death will overtake him: because you have given him no word of his danger, death will overtake him in his evil-doing, and there will be no memory of the upright acts which he has done; but I will make you responsible for his blood. </span>
<span class='v EK3_21' data-id='EK3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But if you say to the upright man that he is not to do evil, he will certainly keep his life because he took note of your word; and your life will be safe. </span>
<span class='v EK3_22' data-id='EK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the hand of the Lord was on me there; and he said, Get up and go out into the valley and there I will have talk with you. </span>
<span class='v EK3_23' data-id='EK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then I got up and went out into the valley; and I saw the glory of the Lord resting there as I had seen it by the river Chebar; and I went down on my face. </span>
<span class='v EK3_24' data-id='EK3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then the spirit came into me and put me on my feet; and he had talk with me and said to me, Go and keep yourself shut up inside your house. </span>
<span class='v EK3_25' data-id='EK3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But see, O son of man, I will put bands on you, prisoning you in them, and you will not go out among them: </span>
<span class='v EK3_26' data-id='EK3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I will make your tongue fixed to the roof of your mouth, so that you have no voice and may not make protests to them: for they are an uncontrolled people. </span>
<span class='v EK3_27' data-id='EK3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But when I have talk with you I will make your mouth open, and you are to say to them, This is what the Lord has said: Let the hearer give ear; and as for him who will not, let him keep his ears shut: for they are an uncontrolled people. </span></div></div>
