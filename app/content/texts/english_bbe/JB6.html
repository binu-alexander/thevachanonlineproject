<span class='v JB6_1' data-id='JB6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Job made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB6_2' data-id='JB6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If only my passion might be measured, and put into the scales against my trouble! </span>
<span class='v JB6_3' data-id='JB6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For then its weight would be more than the sand of the seas: because of this my words have been uncontrolled. </span>
<span class='v JB6_4' data-id='JB6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For the arrows of the Ruler of all are present with me, and their poison goes deep into my spirit: his army of fears is put in order against me. </span>
<span class='v JB6_5' data-id='JB6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Does the ass of the fields give out his voice when he has grass? or does the ox make sounds over his food? </span>
<span class='v JB6_6' data-id='JB6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Will a man take food which has no taste without salt? or is there any taste in the soft substance of purslain? </span>
<span class='v JB6_7' data-id='JB6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>My soul has no desire for such things, they are as disease in my food. </span>
<span class='v JB6_8' data-id='JB6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If only I might have an answer to my prayer, and God would give me my desire! </span>
<span class='v JB6_9' data-id='JB6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If only he would be pleased to put an end to me; and would let loose his hand, so that I might be cut off! </span>
<span class='v JB6_10' data-id='JB6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I would still have comfort, and I would have joy in the pains of death, for I have not been false to the words of the Holy One. </span>
<span class='v JB6_11' data-id='JB6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Have I strength to go on waiting, or have I any end to be looking forward to? </span>
<span class='v JB6_12' data-id='JB6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh brass? </span>
<span class='v JB6_13' data-id='JB6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I have no help in myself, and wisdom is completely gone from me. </span>
<span class='v JB6_14' data-id='JB6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He whose heart is shut against his friend has given up the fear of the Ruler of all. </span>
<span class='v JB6_15' data-id='JB6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>My friends have been false like a stream, like streams in the valleys which come to an end: </span>
<span class='v JB6_16' data-id='JB6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Which are dark because of the ice, and the snow falling into them; </span>
<span class='v JB6_17' data-id='JB6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Under the burning sun they are cut off, and come to nothing because of the heat. </span>
<span class='v JB6_18' data-id='JB6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The camel-trains go out of their way; they go up into the waste and come to destruction. </span>
<span class='v JB6_19' data-id='JB6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The camel-trains of Tema were searching with care, the bands of Sheba were waiting for them: </span>
<span class='v JB6_20' data-id='JB6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>They were put to shame because of their hope; they came and their hope was gone. </span>
<span class='v JB6_21' data-id='JB6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So have you now become to me; you see my sad condition and are in fear. </span>
<span class='v JB6_22' data-id='JB6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Did I say, Give me something? or, Make a payment for me out of your wealth? </span>
<span class='v JB6_23' data-id='JB6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Or, Get me out of the power of my hater? or, Give money so that I may be free from the power of the cruel ones? </span>
<span class='v JB6_24' data-id='JB6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Give me teaching and I will be quiet; and make me see my error. </span>
<span class='v JB6_25' data-id='JB6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>How pleasing are upright words! but what force is there in your arguments? </span>
<span class='v JB6_26' data-id='JB6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>My words may seem wrong to you, but the words of him who has no hope are for the wind. </span>
<span class='v JB6_27' data-id='JB6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Truly, you are such as would give up the child of a dead man to his creditors, and would make a profit out of your friend. </span>
<span class='v JB6_28' data-id='JB6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now then, let your eyes be turned to me, for truly I will not say what is false to your face. </span>
<span class='v JB6_29' data-id='JB6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Let your minds be changed, and do not have an evil opinion of me; yes, be changed, for my righteousness is still in me. </span>
<span class='v JB6_30' data-id='JB6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Is there evil in my tongue? is not the cause of my trouble clear to me? </span></div></div>
