<span class='v MT17_1' data-id='MT17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, his brother, and makes them go up with him into a high mountain by themselves. </span>
<span class='v MT17_2' data-id='MT17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he was changed in form before them; and his face was shining like the sun, and his clothing became white as light. </span>
<span class='v MT17_3' data-id='MT17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Moses and Elijah came before their eyes, talking with him. </span>
<span class='v MT17_4' data-id='MT17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Peter made answer and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will let me, I will make here three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah. </span>
<span class='v MT17_5' data-id='MT17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>While he was still talking, a bright cloud came over them: and a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased; give ear to him. </span>
<span class='v MT17_6' data-id='MT17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And at these words the disciples went down on their faces in great fear. </span>
<span class='v MT17_7' data-id='MT17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Jesus came and put his hand on them and said, Get up and have no fear. </span>
<span class='v MT17_8' data-id='MT17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, but Jesus only. </span>
<span class='v MT17_9' data-id='MT17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus gave them orders, saying, Let no man have word of what you have seen, till the Son of man has come again from the dead. </span>
<span class='v MT17_10' data-id='MT17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And his disciples, questioning him, said, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah has to come first? </span>
<span class='v MT17_11' data-id='MT17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And in answer he said, Elijah truly has to come and put all things right: </span>
<span class='v MT17_12' data-id='MT17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But I say to you that Elijah has come, and they had no knowledge of him, but did to him whatever they were pleased to do; the same will the Son of man undergo at their hands. </span>
<span class='v MT17_13' data-id='MT17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples saw that he was talking to them of John the Baptist. </span>
<span class='v MT17_14' data-id='MT17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And when they came to the people, a man went down on his knees to him, saying, </span>
<span class='v MT17_15' data-id='MT17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Lord have mercy on my son: for he is off his head, and is in great pain; and frequently he goes falling into the fire, and frequently into the water. </span>
<span class='v MT17_16' data-id='MT17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I took him to your disciples, and they were not able to make him well. </span>
<span class='v MT17_17' data-id='MT17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, answering, said, O false and foolish generation, how long will I be with you? how long will I put up with you? let him come here to me. </span>
<span class='v MT17_18' data-id='MT17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Jesus gave orders to the unclean spirit, and it went out of him: and the boy was made well from that hour. </span>
<span class='v MT17_19' data-id='MT17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately, and said, Why were we not able to send it out? </span>
<span class='v MT17_20' data-id='MT17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he says to them, Because of your little faith: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Be moved from this place to that; and it will be moved; and nothing will be impossible to you. </span>
<span class='v MT17_21' data-id='MT17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>[] </span>
<span class='v MT17_22' data-id='MT17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And while they were going about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man will be given up into the hands of men; </span>
<span class='v MT17_23' data-id='MT17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And they will put him to death, and the third day he will come again from the dead. And they were very sad. </span>
<span class='v MT17_24' data-id='MT17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when they had come to Capernaum, those who took the Temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your master make payment of the Temple tax? </span>
<span class='v MT17_25' data-id='MT17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? from whom do the kings of the earth get payment or tax? from their sons or from other people? </span>
<span class='v MT17_26' data-id='MT17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And when he said, From other people, Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free. </span>
<span class='v MT17_27' data-id='MT17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But, so that we may not be a cause of trouble to them, go to the sea, and let down a hook, and take the first fish which comes up; and in his mouth you will see a bit of money: take that, and give it to them for me and you. </span></div></div>
