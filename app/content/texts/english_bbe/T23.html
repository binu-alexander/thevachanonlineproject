<span class='v T23_1' data-id='T23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But be certain of this, that in the last days times of trouble will come. </span>
<span class='v T23_2' data-id='T23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, uplifted in pride, given to bitter words, going against the authority of their fathers, never giving praise, having no religion, </span>
<span class='v T23_3' data-id='T23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Without natural love, bitter haters, saying evil of others, violent and uncontrolled, hating all good, </span>
<span class='v T23_4' data-id='T23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>False to their friends, acting without thought, lifted up in mind, loving pleasure more than God; </span>
<span class='v T23_5' data-id='T23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Having a form of religion, but turning their backs on the power of it: go not with these. </span>
<span class='v T23_6' data-id='T23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For these are they who go secretly into houses, making prisoners of foolish women, weighted down with sin, turned from the way by their evil desires, </span>
<span class='v T23_7' data-id='T23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Ever learning, and never coming to the knowledge of what is true. </span>
<span class='v T23_8' data-id='T23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And as James and Jambres went against Moses, so do these go against what is true: men of evil minds, who, tested by faith, are seen to be false. </span>
<span class='v T23_9' data-id='T23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But they will go no farther: for their foolish behaviour will be clear to all men, as theirs was in the end. </span>
<span class='v T23_10' data-id='T23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But you took as your example my teaching, behaviour, purpose, and faith; my long waiting, my love, my quiet undergoing of trouble; </span>
<span class='v T23_11' data-id='T23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>My punishments and pain; the things which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; the cruel attacks made on me: and the Lord made me free from them all. </span>
<span class='v T23_12' data-id='T23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Yes, and all whose purpose is to be living in the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus, will be cruelly attacked. </span>
<span class='v T23_13' data-id='T23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Evil and false men will become worse and worse, using deceit and themselves overcome by deceit. </span>
<span class='v T23_14' data-id='T23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But see that you keep to the teaching you have been given and the things of which you are certain, conscious of who has been your teacher; </span>
<span class='v T23_15' data-id='T23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And that from the time when you were a child, you have had knowledge of the holy Writings, which are able to make you wise to salvation, through faith in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T23_16' data-id='T23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Every holy Writing which comes from God is of profit for teaching, for training, for guiding, for education in righteousness: </span>
<span class='v T23_17' data-id='T23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So that the man of God may be complete, trained and made ready for every good work. </span></div></div>
