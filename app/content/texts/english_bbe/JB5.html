<span class='v JB5_1' data-id='JB5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give now a cry for help; is there anyone who will give you an answer? and to which of the holy ones will you make your prayer? </span>
<span class='v JB5_2' data-id='JB5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For wrath is the cause of death to the foolish, and he who has no wisdom comes to his end through passion. </span>
<span class='v JB5_3' data-id='JB5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly the curse came on his house. </span>
<span class='v JB5_4' data-id='JB5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now his children have no safe place, and they are crushed before the judges, for no one takes up their cause. </span>
<span class='v JB5_5' data-id='JB5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Their produce is taken by him who has no food, and their grain goes to the poor, and he who is in need of water gets it from their spring. </span>
<span class='v JB5_6' data-id='JB5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For evil does not come out of the dust, or trouble out of the earth; </span>
<span class='v JB5_7' data-id='JB5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But trouble is man's fate from birth, as the flames go up from the fire. </span>
<span class='v JB5_8' data-id='JB5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But as for me, I would make my prayer to God, and I would put my cause before him: </span>
<span class='v JB5_9' data-id='JB5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Who does great things outside our knowledge, wonders without number: </span>
<span class='v JB5_10' data-id='JB5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Who gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields: </span>
<span class='v JB5_11' data-id='JB5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Lifting up those who are low, and putting the sad in a safe place; </span>
<span class='v JB5_12' data-id='JB5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Who makes the designs of the wise go wrong, so that they are unable to give effect to their purposes. </span>
<span class='v JB5_13' data-id='JB5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He takes the wise in their secret designs, and the purposes of the twisted are cut off suddenly. </span>
<span class='v JB5_14' data-id='JB5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the daytime it becomes dark for them, and in the sunlight they go feeling about as if it was night. </span>
<span class='v JB5_15' data-id='JB5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But he keeps safe from their sword those who have no father, and the poor from the power of the strong. </span>
<span class='v JB5_16' data-id='JB5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So the poor man has hope, and the mouth of the evil-doer is stopped. </span>
<span class='v JB5_17' data-id='JB5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Truly, that man is happy who has training from the hand of God: so do not let your heart be shut to the teaching of the Ruler of all. </span>
<span class='v JB5_18' data-id='JB5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For after his punishment he gives comfort, and after wounding, his hands make you well. </span>
<span class='v JB5_19' data-id='JB5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He will keep you safe from six troubles, and in seven no evil will come near you. </span>
<span class='v JB5_20' data-id='JB5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When there is need of food he will keep you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. </span>
<span class='v JB5_21' data-id='JB5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He will keep you safe from the evil tongue; and you will have no fear of wasting when it comes. </span>
<span class='v JB5_22' data-id='JB5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You will make sport of destruction and need, and will have no fear of the beasts of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JB5_23' data-id='JB5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For you will be in agreement with the stones of the earth, and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you. </span>
<span class='v JB5_24' data-id='JB5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And you will be certain that your tent is at peace, and after looking over your property you will see that nothing is gone. </span>
<span class='v JB5_25' data-id='JB5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>You will be certain that your seed will be great, and your offspring like the plants of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JB5_26' data-id='JB5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>You will come to your last resting-place in full strength, as the grain is taken up to the crushing-floor in its time. </span>
<span class='v JB5_27' data-id='JB5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>See, we have made search with care, and it is so; it has come to our ears; see that you take note of it for yourself. </span></div></div>
