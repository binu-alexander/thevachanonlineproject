<span class='v JB14_1' data-id='JB14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>As for man, the son of woman, his days are short and full of trouble. </span>
<span class='v JB14_2' data-id='JB14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He comes out like a flower, and is cut down: he goes in flight like a shade, and is never seen again. </span>
<span class='v JB14_3' data-id='JB14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Is it on such a one as this that your eyes are fixed, with the purpose of judging him? </span>
<span class='v JB14_4' data-id='JB14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If only a clean thing might come out of an unclean! But it is not possible. </span>
<span class='v JB14_5' data-id='JB14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>If his days are ordered, and you have knowledge of the number of his months, having given him a fixed limit past which he may not go; </span>
<span class='v JB14_6' data-id='JB14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let your eyes be turned away from him, and take your hand from him, so that he may have pleasure at the end of his day, like a servant working for payment. </span>
<span class='v JB14_7' data-id='JB14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For there is hope of a tree; if it is cut down, it will come to life again, and its branches will not come to an end. </span>
<span class='v JB14_8' data-id='JB14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Though its root may be old in the earth, and its cut-off end may be dead in the dust; </span>
<span class='v JB14_9' data-id='JB14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Still, at the smell of water, it will make buds, and put out branches like a young plant. </span>
<span class='v JB14_10' data-id='JB14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But man comes to his death and is gone: he gives up his spirit, and where is he? </span>
<span class='v JB14_11' data-id='JB14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The waters go from a pool, and a river becomes waste and dry; </span>
<span class='v JB14_12' data-id='JB14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So man goes down to his last resting-place and comes not again: till the heavens come to an end, they will not be awake or come out of their sleep. </span>
<span class='v JB14_13' data-id='JB14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>If only you would keep me safe in the underworld, putting me in a secret place till your wrath is past, giving me a fixed time when I might come to your memory again! </span>
<span class='v JB14_14' data-id='JB14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If death takes a man, will he come to life again? All the days of my trouble I would be waiting, till the time came for me to be free. </span>
<span class='v JB14_15' data-id='JB14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>At the sound of your voice I would give an answer, and you would have a desire for the work of your hands. </span>
<span class='v JB14_16' data-id='JB14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For now my steps are numbered by you, and my sin is not overlooked. </span>
<span class='v JB14_17' data-id='JB14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>My wrongdoing is corded up in a bag, and my sin is shut up safe. </span>
<span class='v JB14_18' data-id='JB14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But truly a mountain falling comes to dust, and a rock is moved from its place; </span>
<span class='v JB14_19' data-id='JB14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The stones are crushed small by the force of the waters; the dust of the earth is washed away by their overflowing: and so you put an end to the hope of man. </span>
<span class='v JB14_20' data-id='JB14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You overcome him for ever, and he is gone; his face is changed in death, and you send him away. </span>
<span class='v JB14_21' data-id='JB14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>His sons come to honour, and he has no knowledge of it; they are made low, but he is not conscious of it. </span>
<span class='v JB14_22' data-id='JB14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Only his flesh still has pain, and his soul is sad. </span></div></div>
