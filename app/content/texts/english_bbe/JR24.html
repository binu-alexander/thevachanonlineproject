<span class='v JR24_2' data-id='JR24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>One basket had very good figs, like the figs which first come to growth: and the other basket had very bad figs, so bad that they were of no use for food. </span>
<span class='v JR24_3' data-id='JR24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord said to me, What do you see, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs are very good, and the bad very bad, and of no use for food, they are so bad. </span>
<span class='v JR24_4' data-id='JR24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR24_5' data-id='JR24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, has said: Like these good figs, so in my eyes will be the prisoners of Judah, whom I have sent from this place into the land of the Chaldaeans for their good. </span>
<span class='v JR24_6' data-id='JR24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I will keep my eyes on them for good, and I will take them back again to this land, building them up and not pulling them down, planting them and not uprooting them. </span>
<span class='v JR24_7' data-id='JR24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I will give them a heart to have knowledge of me, that I am the Lord: and they will be my people, and I will be their God: for they will come back to me with all their heart. </span>
<span class='v JR24_8' data-id='JR24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And like the bad figs which are so bad that they are of no use for food, so I will give up Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his chiefs and the rest of Jerusalem who are still in this land, and those who are in the land of Egypt: </span>
<span class='v JR24_9' data-id='JR24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I will give them up to be a cause of fear and of trouble among all the kingdoms of the earth; to be a name of shame and common talk and a cutting word and a curse in all the places wherever I will send them wandering. </span>
<span class='v JR24_10' data-id='JR24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I will send the sword, and need of food, and disease, among them till they are all cut off from the land which I gave to them and to their fathers. </span></div></div>
