<span class='v SS3_2' data-id='SS3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I will get up now and go about the town, in the streets and in the wide ways I will go after him who is the love of my soul: I went after him, but I did not see him. </span>
<span class='v SS3_3' data-id='SS3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The watchmen who go about the town came by me; to them I said, Have you seen him who is my heart's desire? </span>
<span class='v SS3_4' data-id='SS3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I was but a little way from them, when I came face to face with him who is the love of my soul. I took him by the hands, and did not let him go, till I had taken him into my mother's house, and into the room of her who gave me birth. </span>
<span class='v SS3_5' data-id='SS3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes of the field, let not love be moved till it is ready. </span>
