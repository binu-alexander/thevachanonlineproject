<span class='v PS18_2' data-id='PS18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The Lord is my Rock, my walled town, and my saviour; my God, my Rock, in him will I put my faith; my breastplate, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS18_3' data-id='PS18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I will send up my cry to the Lord, who is to be praised; so will I be made safe from those who are against me. </span></div>
