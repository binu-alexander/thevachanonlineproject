<span class='v MC6_1' data-id='MC6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Give ear now to the words of the Lord: Up! put forward your cause before the mountains, let your voice be sounding among the hills. </span>
<span class='v MC6_2' data-id='MC6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give ear, O you mountains, to the Lord's cause, and take note, you bases of the earth: for the Lord has a cause against his people, and he will take it up with Israel. </span>
<span class='v MC6_3' data-id='MC6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>O my people, what have I done to you? how have I been a weariness to you? give answer against me. </span>
<span class='v MC6_4' data-id='MC6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For I took you up out of the land of Egypt and made you free from the prison-house; I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. </span>
<span class='v MC6_5' data-id='MC6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>O my people, keep in mind now what was designed by Balak, king of Moab, and the answer which Balaam, son of Beor, gave him; the events, from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may be certain of the upright acts of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v MC6_6' data-id='MC6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>With what am I to come before the Lord and go with bent head before the high God? am I to come before him with burned offerings, with young oxen a year old? </span>
<span class='v MC6_7' data-id='MC6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of sheep or with ten thousand rivers of oil? am I to give my first child for my wrongdoing, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? </span>
<span class='v MC6_8' data-id='MC6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He has made clear to you, O man, what is good; and what is desired from you by the Lord; only doing what is right, and loving mercy, and walking without pride before your God. </span>
<span class='v MC6_9' data-id='MC6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The voice of the Lord is crying out to the town: Give ear, you tribes and the meeting of the town. </span>
<span class='v MC6_10' data-id='MC6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Am I to let the stores of the evil-doer go out of my memory, and the short measure, which is cursed? </span>
<span class='v MC6_11' data-id='MC6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Is it possible for me to let wrong scales and the bag of false weights go without punishment? </span>
<span class='v MC6_12' data-id='MC6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For its men of wealth are cruel, and its people have said what is not true, and their tongue is false in their mouth. </span>
<span class='v MC6_13' data-id='MC6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So I have made a start with your punishment; I have made you waste because of your sins. </span>
<span class='v MC6_14' data-id='MC6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You will have food, but not enough; your shame will be ever with you: you will get your goods moved, but you will not take them away safely; and what you do take away I will give to the sword. </span>
<span class='v MC6_15' data-id='MC6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You will put in seed, but you will not get in the grain; you will be crushing olives, but your bodies will not be rubbed with the oil; and you will get in the grapes, but you will have no wine. </span>
<span class='v MC6_16' data-id='MC6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For you have kept the laws of Omri and all the works of the family of Ahab, and you have been guided by their designs: so that I might make you a cause of wonder and your people a cause of hisses; and the shame of my people will be on you. </span></div></div>
