<span class='v LV20_2' data-id='LV20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Again, say to the children of Israel, If any man of the children of Israel, or any other man living in Israel, gives his offspring to Molech, he is certainly to be put to death: he is to be stoned by the people of the land; </span>
<span class='v LV20_3' data-id='LV20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And my face will be turned against that man, and he will be cut off from his people; because he has given his offspring to Molech, making my holy place unclean, and making my holy name common. </span>
<span class='v LV20_4' data-id='LV20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And if the people of the land do not take note of that man when he gives his offspring to Molech, and do not put him to death, </span>
<span class='v LV20_5' data-id='LV20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then my face will be turned against him and his family, and he and all those who do evil with him will be cut off from among their people. </span>

<span class='v LV20_23' data-id='LV20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And do not keep the rules of the nations which I am driving out before you; for they did all these things, and for that reason my soul was turned against them. </span>
