<span class='v NU10_2' data-id='NU10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Make two silver horns of hammered work, to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents. </span>
<span class='v NU10_3' data-id='NU10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When they are sounded, all the people are to come together to you at the door of the Tent of meeting. </span>

<span class='v NU10_6' data-id='NU10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>At the sound of a second loud note, the tents on the south side are to go forward: the loud note will be the sign to go forward. </span>

<span class='v NU10_8' data-id='NU10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The horns are to be sounded by the sons of Aaron, the priests; this is to be a law for you for ever, from generation to generation. </span>
<span class='v NU10_9' data-id='NU10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong, then let the loud note of the horn be sounded; and the Lord your God will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you. </span>
<span class='v NU10_10' data-id='NU10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month, let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace-offerings; and they will put the Lord in mind of you: I am the Lord your God. </span>
<span class='v NU10_11' data-id='NU10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now in the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud was taken up from over the Tent of witness. </span>
<span class='v NU10_12' data-id='NU10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the children of Israel went on their journey out of the waste land of Sinai; and the cloud came to rest in the waste land of Paran. </span>

<span class='v NU10_28' data-id='NU10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>This was the order in which the children of Israel were journeying by armies; so they went forward. </span>
<span class='v NU10_29' data-id='NU10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of his father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, We are journeying to that place of which the Lord has said, I will give it to you: so come with us, and it will be for your profit: for the Lord has good things in store for Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU10_30' data-id='NU10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But he said, I will not go with you, I will go back to the land of my birth and to my relations. </span>
<span class='v NU10_31' data-id='NU10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said, Do not go from us; for you will be eyes for us, guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents. </span>

<span class='v NU10_33' data-id='NU10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So they went forward three days' journey from the mountain of the Lord; and the ark of the Lord's agreement went three days' journey before them, looking for a resting-place for them; </span>
<span class='v NU10_34' data-id='NU10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And by day the cloud of the Lord went over them, when they went forward from the place where they had put up their tents. </span>
<span class='v NU10_35' data-id='NU10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And when the ark went forward Moses said, Come up, O Lord, and let the armies of those who are against you be broken, and let your haters go in flight before you. </span>
<span class='v NU10_36' data-id='NU10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And when it came to rest, he said, Take rest, O Lord, and give a blessing to the families of Israel. </span></div></div>
