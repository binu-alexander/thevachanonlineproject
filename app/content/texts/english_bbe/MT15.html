<span class='v MT15_1' data-id='MT15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then there came to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying, </span>
<span class='v MT15_2' data-id='MT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Why do your disciples go against the teaching of the fathers? for they take food with unwashed hands. </span>
<span class='v MT15_3' data-id='MT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And in answer he said to them, Why do you, yourselves, go against the word of God on account of the teaching which has been handed down to you? </span>
<span class='v MT15_4' data-id='MT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For God said, Give honour to your father and mother: and, He who says evil of father or mother will be put to death. </span>
<span class='v MT15_5' data-id='MT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you say, If a man says to his father or his mother, That by which you might have had profit from me is given to God; </span>
<span class='v MT15_6' data-id='MT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There is no need for him to give honour to his father. And you have made the word of God without effect because of your teaching. </span>
<span class='v MT15_7' data-id='MT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You false ones, well did Isaiah say of you, </span>
<span class='v MT15_8' data-id='MT15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>These people give me honour with their lips, but their heart is far from me. </span>
<span class='v MT15_9' data-id='MT15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But their worship is to no purpose, while they give as their teaching the rules of men. </span>
<span class='v MT15_10' data-id='MT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he got the people together and said to them, Give ear, and let my words be clear to you: </span>
<span class='v MT15_11' data-id='MT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Not that which goes into the mouth makes a man unclean, but that which comes out of the mouth. </span>
<span class='v MT15_12' data-id='MT15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came and said to him, Did you see that the Pharisees were troubled when these words came to their ears? </span>
<span class='v MT15_13' data-id='MT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But he said in answer, Every plant which my Father in heaven has not put in the earth, will be taken up by the roots. </span>
<span class='v MT15_14' data-id='MT15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let them be: they are blind guides. And if a blind man is guiding a blind man, the two will go falling into a hole together. </span>
<span class='v MT15_15' data-id='MT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Peter said to him, Make the story clear to us. </span>
<span class='v MT15_16' data-id='MT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he said, Are you, like them, still without wisdom? </span>
<span class='v MT15_17' data-id='MT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth goes on into the stomach, and is sent out as waste? </span>
<span class='v MT15_18' data-id='MT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But the things which come out of the mouth come from the heart; and they make a man unclean. </span>
<span class='v MT15_19' data-id='MT15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, the taking of life, broken faith between the married, unclean desires of the flesh, taking of property, false witness, bitter words: </span>
<span class='v MT15_20' data-id='MT15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>These are the things which make a man unclean; but to take food with unwashed hands does not make a man unclean. </span>
<span class='v MT15_21' data-id='MT15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Jesus went away from there into the country of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MT15_22' data-id='MT15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And a woman of Canaan came out from those parts, crying and saying, Have pity on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is greatly troubled with an unclean spirit. </span>
<span class='v MT15_23' data-id='MT15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he gave her no answer. And his disciples came and said to him, Send her away, for she is crying after us. </span>
<span class='v MT15_24' data-id='MT15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But he made answer and said, I was sent only to the wandering sheep of the house of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT15_25' data-id='MT15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But she came and gave him worship, saying, Help, Lord. </span>
<span class='v MT15_26' data-id='MT15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he made answer and said, It is not right to take the children's bread and give it to the dogs. </span>
<span class='v MT15_27' data-id='MT15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But she said, Yes, Lord: but even the dogs take the bits from under their masters' table. </span>
<span class='v MT15_28' data-id='MT15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman, great is your faith: let your desire be done. And her daughter was made well from that hour. </span>
<span class='v MT15_29' data-id='MT15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Jesus went from there and came to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and took his seat there. </span>
<span class='v MT15_30' data-id='MT15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And there came to him great numbers of people having with them those who were broken in body, or blind, or without voice, or wounded, or ill in any way, and a number of others; they put them down at his feet and he made them well: </span>
<span class='v MT15_31' data-id='MT15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So that the people were full of wonder when they saw that those who had no voice were talking, the feeble were made strong, those whose bodies were broken had the power of walking, and the blind were able to see: and they gave glory to the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT15_32' data-id='MT15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And Jesus got his disciples together and said, I have pity for the people, because they have now been with me three days and have no food: and I will not send them away without food, or they will have no strength for the journey. </span>
<span class='v MT15_33' data-id='MT15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And the disciples say to him, How may we get enough bread in a waste place, to give food to such a number of people? </span>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus says to them, How much bread have you? And they said, Seven cakes, and some small fishes. </span>
<span class='v MT15_35' data-id='MT15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then he gave an order to the people to be seated on the earth, </span>
<span class='v MT15_36' data-id='MT15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And he took the seven cakes of bread and the fishes; and having given praise, he gave the broken bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the people. </span>
<span class='v MT15_37' data-id='MT15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And they all took food, and had enough; and they took up of the broken bits, seven baskets full. </span>
<span class='v MT15_38' data-id='MT15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And there were four thousand men who took food, together with women and children. </span>
<span class='v MT15_39' data-id='MT15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when he had sent the people away, he got into the boat, and came into the country of Magadan. </span></div></div>
