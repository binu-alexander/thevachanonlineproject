<span class='v MT3_1' data-id='MT3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the waste land of Judaea, </span>
<span class='v MT3_2' data-id='MT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin; for the kingdom of heaven is near. </span>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is he of whom Isaiah the prophet said, The voice of one crying in the waste land, Make ready the way of the Lord, make his roads straight. </span>
<span class='v MT3_4' data-id='MT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now John was clothed in camel's hair, with a leather band about him; and his food was locusts and honey. </span>
<span class='v MT3_5' data-id='MT3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jerusalem and all Judaea went out to him, and all the people from near Jordan; </span>
<span class='v MT3_6' data-id='MT3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they were given baptism by him in the river Jordan, saying openly that they had done wrong. </span>
<span class='v MT3_7' data-id='MT3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But when he saw a number of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of snakes, at whose word are you going in flight from the wrath to come? </span>
<span class='v MT3_8' data-id='MT3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Let your change of heart be seen in your works: </span>
<span class='v MT3_9' data-id='MT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And say not to yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; because I say to you that God is able from these stones to make children for Abraham. </span>
<span class='v MT3_10' data-id='MT3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And even now the axe is put to the root of the trees; every tree then which does not give good fruit is cut down, and put into the fire. </span>
<span class='v MT3_11' data-id='MT3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Truly, I give baptism with water to those of you whose hearts are changed; but he who comes after me is greater than I, whose shoes I am not good enough to take up: he will give you baptism with the Holy Spirit and with fire: </span>
<span class='v MT3_12' data-id='MT3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In whose hand is the instrument with which he will make clean his grain; he will put the good grain in his store, but the waste will be burned up in the fire which will never be put out. </span>
<span class='v MT3_13' data-id='MT3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be given baptism by him. </span>
<span class='v MT3_14' data-id='MT3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But John would have kept him back, saying, It is I who have need of baptism from you, and do you come to me? </span>
<span class='v MT3_15' data-id='MT3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made answer, saying to him, Let it be so now: because so it is right for us to make righteousness complete. Then he gave him baptism. </span>
<span class='v MT3_16' data-id='MT3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And Jesus, having been given baptism, straight away went up from the water; and, the heavens opening, he saw the Spirit of God coming down on him as a dove; </span>
<span class='v MT3_17' data-id='MT3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And a voice came out of heaven, saying, This is my dearly loved Son, with whom I am well pleased. </span></div></div>
