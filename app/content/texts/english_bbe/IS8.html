<span class='v IS8_1' data-id='IS8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said to me, Take a great writing-board, and on it put down in common letters, Maher-shalal-hash-baz; </span>
<span class='v IS8_2' data-id='IS8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And take true witnesses to the writing, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah, the son of Jeberechiah. </span>
<span class='v IS8_3' data-id='IS8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I went in to my wife, and she became with child, and gave birth to a son. Then the Lord said to me, Give him the name Maher-shalal-hash-baz, </span>
<span class='v IS8_4' data-id='IS8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For before the child is able to say, Father, or, Mother, the wealth of Damascus and the goods of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria. </span>
<span class='v IS8_5' data-id='IS8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said again to me, </span>
<span class='v IS8_6' data-id='IS8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Because this people will have nothing to do with the softly-flowing waters of Shiloah, and have fear of Rezin and Remaliah's son; </span>
<span class='v IS8_7' data-id='IS8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For this cause the Lord is sending on them the waters of the River, deep and strong, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it will come up through all its streams, overflowing all its edges: </span>
<span class='v IS8_8' data-id='IS8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And it will come on into Judah; rushing on and overflowing, till the waters are up to the neck; ***and his outstretched wings will be covering the land from side to side: for God is with us. </span>
<span class='v IS8_9' data-id='IS8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Have knowledge, O peoples, and be in fear; give ear, all you far-off parts of the earth: </span>
<span class='v IS8_10' data-id='IS8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Let your designs be formed, and they will come to nothing; give your orders, and they will not be effected: for God is with us. </span>
<span class='v IS8_11' data-id='IS8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For the Lord, controlling me with a strong hand, gave me orders not to go in the way of this people, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS8_12' data-id='IS8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Do not say, It is holy, about everything of which this people says, It is holy; and do not be in fear of what they go in fear of. </span>
<span class='v IS8_13' data-id='IS8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But let the Lord of armies be holy to you, and go in fear of him, giving honour to him. </span>
<span class='v IS8_14' data-id='IS8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he will be for a holy place: but for a stone of falling and a rock of trouble to the two houses of Israel, and to the men of Jerusalem, for a net in which they may be taken. </span>
<span class='v IS8_15' data-id='IS8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And numbers of them, falling on the stone, will be broken, and will be taken in the net. </span>
<span class='v IS8_16' data-id='IS8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let my teaching be kept secret: and my words be given to my disciples only. </span>
<span class='v IS8_17' data-id='IS8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And I will be waiting for the Lord, whose face is veiled from the house of Jacob, and I will be looking for him. </span>
<span class='v IS8_18' data-id='IS8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>See, I and the children whom the Lord has given me, are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the Lord of armies, whose resting-place is in Mount Zion. </span>
<span class='v IS8_19' data-id='IS8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And when they say to you, Make request for us to those who have control of spirits, and to those wise in secret arts, who make hollow bird-like sounds; is it not right for a people to make request to their gods, to make request for the living to the dead? </span>
<span class='v IS8_20' data-id='IS8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then say to them, Put your faith in the teaching and the witness. ... If they do not say such things. ... For him there is no dawn. ... </span>
<span class='v IS8_21' data-id='IS8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he will go through the land in bitter trouble and in need of food; and when he is unable to get food, he will become angry, cursing his king and his God, and his eyes will be turned to heaven on high; </span>
<span class='v IS8_22' data-id='IS8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he will be looking down on the earth, and there will be trouble and dark clouds, black night where there is no seeing. </span></div></div>
