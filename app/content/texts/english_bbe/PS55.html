<span class='v PS55_3' data-id='PS55_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I am troubled because of the voice of the cruel ones, because of the loud cry of the evil-doers; for they put a weight of evil on me, and they are cruel in their hate for me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS55_4' data-id='PS55_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>My heart is deeply wounded, and the fear of death has come on me. </span></div>

<span class='v PS55_12' data-id='PS55_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For it was not my hater who said evil of me; that would have been no grief to me; it was not one outside the number of my friends who made himself strong against me, or I would have kept myself from him in a secret place; </span></div>
