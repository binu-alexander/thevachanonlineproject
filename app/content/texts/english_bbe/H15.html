<span class='v H15_1' data-id='H15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But about the times and their order, my brothers, there is no need for me to say anything to you. </span>
<span class='v H15_2' data-id='H15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves have the knowledge that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. </span>
<span class='v H15_3' data-id='H15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When they say, There is peace and no danger, then sudden destruction will come on them, as birth-pains on a woman with child; and they will not be able to get away from it. </span>
<span class='v H15_4' data-id='H15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you, my brothers, are not in the dark, for that day to overtake you like a thief: </span>
<span class='v H15_5' data-id='H15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For you are all sons of light and of the day: we are not of the night or of the dark. </span>
<span class='v H15_6' data-id='H15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So then, let us not take our rest as the others do, but let us be self-controlled and awake. </span>
<span class='v H15_7' data-id='H15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For those who are sleeping do so in the night; and those who are the worse for drink are so in the night; </span>
<span class='v H15_8' data-id='H15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But let us, who are of the day, be serious, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and on our heads, the hope of salvation. </span>
<span class='v H15_9' data-id='H15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God's purpose for us is not wrath, but salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v H15_10' data-id='H15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Who was put to death for us, so that, awake or sleeping, we may have a part in his life. </span>
<span class='v H15_11' data-id='H15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So then, go on comforting and building up one another, as you have been doing. </span>
<span class='v H15_12' data-id='H15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But we make this request to you, my brothers: give attention to those who are working among you, who are over you in the Lord to keep order among you; </span>
<span class='v H15_13' data-id='H15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And have a high opinion of them in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. </span>
<span class='v H15_14' data-id='H15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And our desire is that you will keep control over those whose lives are not well ordered, giving comfort to the feeble-hearted, supporting those with little strength, and putting up with much from all. </span>
<span class='v H15_15' data-id='H15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let no one give evil for evil; but ever go after what is good, for one another and for all. </span>
<span class='v H15_16' data-id='H15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Have joy at all times. </span>
<span class='v H15_17' data-id='H15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Keep on with your prayers. </span>
<span class='v H15_18' data-id='H15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>In everything give praise: for this is the purpose of God in Christ Jesus for you. </span>
<span class='v H15_19' data-id='H15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Do not put out the light of the Spirit; </span>
<span class='v H15_20' data-id='H15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Do not make little of the words of the prophets; </span>
<span class='v H15_21' data-id='H15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Let all things be tested; keep to what is good; </span>
<span class='v H15_22' data-id='H15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Keep from every form of evil. </span>
<span class='v H15_23' data-id='H15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And may the God of peace himself make you holy in every way; and may your spirit and soul and body be free from all sin at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v H15_24' data-id='H15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>God, by whom you have been marked out in his purpose, is unchanging and will make it complete. </span>
<span class='v H15_25' data-id='H15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Brothers, keep us in mind in your prayers. </span>
<span class='v H15_26' data-id='H15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Give all the brothers a holy kiss. </span>
<span class='v H15_27' data-id='H15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>I give orders in the name of the Lord that all the brothers are to be present at the reading of this letter. </span>
<span class='v H15_28' data-id='H15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. </span></div></div>
