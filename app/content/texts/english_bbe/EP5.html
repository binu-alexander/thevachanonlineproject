<span class='v EP5_1' data-id='EP5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Let it then be your desire to be like God, as well-loved children; </span>
<span class='v EP5_2' data-id='EP5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And be living in love, even as Christ had love for you, and gave himself up for us, an offering to God for a perfume of a sweet smell. </span>
<span class='v EP5_3' data-id='EP5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But evil acts of the flesh and all unclean things, or desire for others' property, let it not even be named among you, as is right for saints; </span>
<span class='v EP5_4' data-id='EP5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And let there be no low behaviour, or foolish talk, or words said in sport, which are not right, but in place of them the giving of praise. </span>
<span class='v EP5_5' data-id='EP5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Being certain of this, that no man who gives way to the passions of the flesh, no unclean person, or one who has desire for the property of others, or who gives worship to images, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and God. </span>
<span class='v EP5_6' data-id='EP5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not be turned from the right way by foolish words; for because of these things the punishment of God comes on those who do not put themselves under him. </span>
<span class='v EP5_7' data-id='EP5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Have no part with such men; </span>
<span class='v EP5_8' data-id='EP5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For you at one time were dark, but now are light in the Lord: let your behaviour be that of children of light </span>
<span class='v EP5_9' data-id='EP5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(Because the fruit of the light is in all righteousness and in everything which is good and true), </span>
<span class='v EP5_10' data-id='EP5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Testing by experience what is well-pleasing to the Lord; </span>
<span class='v EP5_11' data-id='EP5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And have no company with the works of the dark, which give no fruit, but make their true quality clear; </span>
<span class='v EP5_12' data-id='EP5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the things which are done by them in secret it is shame even to put into words. </span>
<span class='v EP5_13' data-id='EP5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But all things, when their true quality is seen, are made clear by the light: because everything which is made clear is light. </span>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this reason he says, Be awake, you who are sleeping, and come up from among the dead, and Christ will be your light. </span>
<span class='v EP5_15' data-id='EP5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Take care then how you are living, not as unwise, but as wise; </span>
<span class='v EP5_16' data-id='EP5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Making good use of the time, because the days are evil. </span>
<span class='v EP5_17' data-id='EP5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this reason, then, do not be foolish, but be conscious of the Lord's pleasure. </span>
<span class='v EP5_18' data-id='EP5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And do not take overmuch wine by which one may be overcome, but be full of the Spirit; </span>
<span class='v EP5_19' data-id='EP5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Joining with one another in holy songs of praise and of the Spirit, using your voice in songs and making melody in your heart to the Lord; </span>
<span class='v EP5_20' data-id='EP5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Giving praise at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; </span>
<span class='v EP5_21' data-id='EP5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Letting yourselves be ruled by one another in the fear of Christ. </span>
<span class='v EP5_22' data-id='EP5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Wives, be under the authority of your husbands, as of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP5_23' data-id='EP5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body. </span>
<span class='v EP5_24' data-id='EP5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And as the church is under Christ's authority, so let wives be under the rule of their husbands in all things. </span>
<span class='v EP5_25' data-id='EP5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, have love for your wives, even as Christ had love for the church, and gave himself for it; </span>
<span class='v EP5_26' data-id='EP5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So that he might make it holy, having made it clean with the washing of water by the word, </span>
<span class='v EP5_27' data-id='EP5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And might take it for himself, a church full of glory, not having one mark or fold or any such thing; but that it might be holy and complete. </span>
<span class='v EP5_28' data-id='EP5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Even so it is right for husbands to have love for their wives as for their bodies. He who has love for his wife has love for himself: </span>
<span class='v EP5_29' data-id='EP5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For no man ever had hate for his flesh; but he gives it food and takes care of it, even as Christ does for the church; </span>
<span class='v EP5_30' data-id='EP5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Because we are parts of his body. </span>
<span class='v EP5_31' data-id='EP5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For this cause will a man go away from his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. </span>
<span class='v EP5_32' data-id='EP5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This is a great secret: but my words are about Christ and the church. </span>
<span class='v EP5_33' data-id='EP5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But do you, everyone, have love for his wife, even as for himself; and let the wife see that she has respect for her husband. </span></div></div>
