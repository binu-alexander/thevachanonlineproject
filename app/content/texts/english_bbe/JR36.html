<span class='v JR36_1' data-id='JR36_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now it came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR36_2' data-id='JR36_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Take a book and put down in it all the words I have said to you against Israel and against Judah and against all the nations, from the day when my word came to you in the days of Josiah till this day. </span>
<span class='v JR36_3' data-id='JR36_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>It may be that the people of Judah, hearing of all the evil which it is my purpose to do to them, will be turned, every man from his evil ways; so that they may have my forgiveness for their evil-doing and their sin. </span>
<span class='v JR36_4' data-id='JR36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah sent for Baruch, the son of Neriah; and Baruch took down from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord which he had said to him, writing them in a book. </span>
<span class='v JR36_5' data-id='JR36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Jeremiah gave orders to Baruch, saying, I am shut up, and am not able to go into the house of the Lord: </span>
<span class='v JR36_6' data-id='JR36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So you are to go, reading there from the book, which you have taken down from my mouth, the words of the Lord, in the hearing of the people in the Lord's house, on a day when they go without food, and in the hearing of all the men of Judah who have come out from their towns. </span>
<span class='v JR36_7' data-id='JR36_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It may be that their prayer for grace will go up to the Lord, and that every man will be turned from his evil ways: for great is the wrath and the passion made clear by the Lord against this people. </span>
<span class='v JR36_8' data-id='JR36_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Baruch, the son of Neriah, did as Jeremiah the prophet gave him orders to do, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the Lord's house. </span>
<span class='v JR36_9' data-id='JR36_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now it came about in the fifth year of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, that it was given out publicly that all the people in Jerusalem, and all the people who came from the towns of Judah to Jerusalem, were to keep from food before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR36_10' data-id='JR36_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Baruch gave a public reading of the words of Jeremiah from the book, in the house of the Lord, in the room of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher square, as one goes in by the new doorway of the Lord's house, in the hearing of all the people. </span>
<span class='v JR36_11' data-id='JR36_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Micaiah, the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, after hearing all the words of the Lord from the book, </span>
<span class='v JR36_12' data-id='JR36_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Went down to the king's house, to the scribe's room: and all the rulers were seated there, Elishama the scribe and Delaiah, the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah, the son of Hananiah, and all the rulers. </span>
<span class='v JR36_13' data-id='JR36_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Micaiah gave them an account of all the words which had come to his ears when Baruch was reading the book to the people. </span>
<span class='v JR36_14' data-id='JR36_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So all the rulers sent Jehudi, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in your hand the book from which you have been reading to the people and come. So Baruch, the son of Neriah, took the book in his hand and came down to them. </span>
<span class='v JR36_15' data-id='JR36_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then they said to him, Be seated now, and give us a reading from it. So Baruch did so, reading it to them. </span>
<span class='v JR36_16' data-id='JR36_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now it came about that, after hearing all the words, they said to one another in fear, We will certainly give the king an account of all these words. </span>
<span class='v JR36_17' data-id='JR36_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And questioning Baruch, they said, Say now, how did you put all these words down in writing from his mouth? </span>
<span class='v JR36_18' data-id='JR36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then Baruch, answering, said, He said all these things to me by word of mouth, and I put them down with ink in the book. </span>
<span class='v JR36_19' data-id='JR36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then the rulers said to Baruch, Go and put yourself in a safe place, you and Jeremiah, and let no man have knowledge of where you are. </span>
<span class='v JR36_20' data-id='JR36_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then they went into the open square to the king; but the book they put away in the room of Elishama the scribe; and they gave the king an account of all the words. </span>
<span class='v JR36_21' data-id='JR36_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So the king sent Jehudi to get the book, and he took it from the room of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi gave a reading of it in the hearing of the king and all the rulers who were by the king's side. </span>
<span class='v JR36_22' data-id='JR36_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now the king was seated in the winter house, and a fire was burning in the fireplace in front of him. </span>
<span class='v JR36_23' data-id='JR36_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And it came about that whenever Jehudi, in his reading, had got through three or four divisions, the king, cutting them with his penknife, put them into the fire, till all the book was burned up in the fire which was burning in the fireplace. </span>
<span class='v JR36_24' data-id='JR36_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But they had no fear and gave no signs of grief, not the king or any of his servants, after hearing all these words. </span>
<span class='v JR36_25' data-id='JR36_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made a strong request to the king not to let the book be burned, but he would not give ear to them. </span>
<span class='v JR36_26' data-id='JR36_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the king gave orders to Jerahmeel, the king's son, and Seraiah, the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the Lord kept them safe. </span>
<span class='v JR36_27' data-id='JR36_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then after the book, in which Baruch had put down the words of Jeremiah, had been burned by the king, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR36_28' data-id='JR36_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Take another book and put down in it all the words which were in the first book, which Jehoiakim, king of Judah, put into the fire. </span>
<span class='v JR36_29' data-id='JR36_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And about Jehoiakim, king of Judah, you are to say, This is what the Lord has said: You have put this book into the fire, saying, Why have you put in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come, causing the destruction of this land and putting an end to every man and beast in it? </span>
<span class='v JR36_30' data-id='JR36_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For this reason the Lord has said of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He will have no son to take his place on the seat of David: his dead body will be put out to undergo the heat of the day and the cold of the night. </span>
<span class='v JR36_31' data-id='JR36_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And I will send punishment on him and on his seed and on his servants for their evil-doing; I will send on them and on the people of Jerusalem and the men of Judah, all the evil which I said against them, but they did not give ear. </span>
<span class='v JR36_32' data-id='JR36_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah took another book, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who put down in it, from the mouth of Jeremiah, all the words of the book which had been burned in the fire by Jehoiakim, king of Judah: and in addition a number of other words of the same sort. </span></div></div>
