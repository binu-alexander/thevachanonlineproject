<span class='v EK37_1' data-id='EK37_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The hand of the Lord had been on me, and he took me out in the spirit of the Lord and put me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones; </span>
<span class='v EK37_2' data-id='EK37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he made me go past them round about: and I saw that there was a very great number of them on the face of the wide valley, and they were very dry. </span>
<span class='v EK37_3' data-id='EK37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Son of man, is it possible for these bones to come to life? And I made answer, and said, It is for you to say, O Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK37_4' data-id='EK37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And again he said to me, Be a prophet to these bones, and say to them, O you dry bones, give ear to the word of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK37_5' data-id='EK37_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>This is what the Lord has said to these bones: See, I will make breath come into you so that you may come to life; </span>
<span class='v EK37_6' data-id='EK37_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will put muscles on you and make flesh come on you, and put skin over you, and breath into you, so that you may have life; and you will be certain that I am the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK37_7' data-id='EK37_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I gave the word as I was ordered: and at my words there was a shaking of the earth, and the bones came together, bone to bone. </span>
<span class='v EK37_8' data-id='EK37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And looking I saw that there were muscles on them and flesh came up, and they were covered with skin: but there was no breath in them. </span>
<span class='v EK37_9' data-id='EK37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, Be a prophet to the wind, be a prophet, son of man, and say to the wind, The Lord has said: Come from the four winds, O wind, breathing on these dead so that they may come to life. </span>
<span class='v EK37_10' data-id='EK37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I gave the word at his orders, and breath came into them, and they came to life and got up on their feet, a very great army. </span>
<span class='v EK37_11' data-id='EK37_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are all the children of Israel: and see, they are saying, Our bones have become dry our hope is gone, we are cut off completely. </span>
<span class='v EK37_12' data-id='EK37_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For this cause be a prophet to them, and say, This is what the Lord has said: See, I am opening the resting-places of your dead, and I will make you come up out of your resting-places, O my people; and I will take you into the land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK37_13' data-id='EK37_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And you will be certain that I am the Lord by my opening the resting-places of your dead and making you come up out of your resting-places, O my people. </span>
<span class='v EK37_14' data-id='EK37_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I will put my spirit in you, so that you may come to life, and I will give you a rest in your land: and you will be certain that I the Lord have said it and have done it, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EK37_15' data-id='EK37_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK37_16' data-id='EK37_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And you, son of man, take one stick, writing on it, For Judah and for the children of Israel who are in his company: then take another stick, writing on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel who are in his company: </span>
<span class='v EK37_17' data-id='EK37_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then, joining them one to another, make them one stick, so that they may be one in your hand. </span>
<span class='v EK37_18' data-id='EK37_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when the children of your people say to you, Will you not make clear to us what these things have to do with us? </span>
<span class='v EK37_19' data-id='EK37_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then say to them, This is what the Lord has said: See, I am taking the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel who are in his company; and I will put it on the stick of Judah and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand. </span>
<span class='v EK37_20' data-id='EK37_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the sticks with your writing on them will be in your hand before their eyes. </span>
<span class='v EK37_21' data-id='EK37_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And say to them, These are the words of the Lord: See, I am taking the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will get them together on every side, and take them into their land: </span>
<span class='v EK37_22' data-id='EK37_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king over them all: and they will no longer be two nations, and will no longer be parted into two kingdoms: </span>
<span class='v EK37_23' data-id='EK37_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And they will no longer make themselves unclean with their images or with their hated things or with any of their sins: but I will give them salvation from all their turning away in which they have done evil, and will make them clean; and they will be to me a people, and I will be to them a God. </span>
<span class='v EK37_24' data-id='EK37_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And my servant David will be king over them; and they will all have one keeper: and they will be guided by my orders and will keep my rules and do them. </span>
<span class='v EK37_25' data-id='EK37_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And they will be living in the land which I gave to Jacob, my servant, in which your fathers were living; and they will go on living there, they and their children and their children's children, for ever: and David, my servant, will be their ruler for ever. </span>
<span class='v EK37_26' data-id='EK37_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I will make an agreement of peace with them: it will be an eternal agreement with them: and I will have mercy on them and make their numbers great, and will put my holy place among them for ever. </span>
<span class='v EK37_27' data-id='EK37_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And my House will be over them; and I will be to them a God, and they will be to me a people. </span>
<span class='v EK37_28' data-id='EK37_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And the nations will be certain that I who make Israel holy am the Lord, when my holy place is among them for ever. </span></div></div>
