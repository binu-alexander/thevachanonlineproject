<div class='p'>
<span class='v PR1_1' data-id='PR1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The wise sayings of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel. </span>
<span class='v PR1_2' data-id='PR1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>To have knowledge of wise teaching; to be clear about the words of reason: </span>
<span class='v PR1_3' data-id='PR1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>To be trained in the ways of wisdom, in righteousness and judging truly and straight behaviour: </span>
<span class='v PR1_4' data-id='PR1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>To make the simple-minded sharp, and to give the young man knowledge, and serious purpose: </span>
<span class='v PR1_5' data-id='PR1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>(The wise man, hearing, will get greater learning, and the acts of the man of good sense will be wisely guided:) </span>
<span class='v PR1_6' data-id='PR1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>To get the sense of wise sayings and secrets, and of the words of the wise and their dark sayings. </span>
<span class='v PR1_7' data-id='PR1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The fear of the Lord is the start of knowledge: but the foolish have no use for wisdom and teaching. </span>
<span class='v PR1_8' data-id='PR1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>My son, give ear to the training of your father, and do not give up the teaching of your mother: </span>
<span class='v PR1_9' data-id='PR1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For they will be a crown of grace for your head, and chain-ornaments about your neck. </span>
<span class='v PR1_10' data-id='PR1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>My son, if sinners would take you out of the right way, do not go with them. </span>
<span class='v PR1_11' data-id='PR1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If they say, Come with us; let us make designs against the good, waiting secretly for the upright, without cause; </span>
<span class='v PR1_12' data-id='PR1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let us overcome them living, like the underworld, and in their strength, as those who go down to death; </span>
<span class='v PR1_13' data-id='PR1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Goods of great price will be ours, our houses will be full of wealth; </span>
<span class='v PR1_14' data-id='PR1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Take your chance with us, and we will all have one money-bag: </span>
<span class='v PR1_15' data-id='PR1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>My son, do not go with them; keep your feet from their ways: </span>
<span class='v PR1_16' data-id='PR1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For their feet are running after evil, and they are quick to take a man's life. </span>
<span class='v PR1_17' data-id='PR1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Truly, to no purpose is the net stretched out before the eyes of the bird: </span>
<span class='v PR1_18' data-id='PR1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they are secretly waiting for their blood and making ready destruction for themselves. </span>
<span class='v PR1_19' data-id='PR1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Such is the fate of everyone who goes in search of profit; it takes away the life of its owners. </span>
<span class='v PR1_20' data-id='PR1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Wisdom is crying out in the street; her voice is loud in the open places; </span>
<span class='v PR1_21' data-id='PR1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Her words are sounding in the meeting-places, and in the doorways of the town: </span>
<span class='v PR1_22' data-id='PR1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>How long, you simple ones, will foolish things be dear to you? and pride a delight to the haters of authority? how long will the foolish go on hating knowledge? </span>
<span class='v PR1_23' data-id='PR1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Be turned again by my sharp words: see, I will send the flow of my spirit on you, and make my words clear to you. </span>
<span class='v PR1_24' data-id='PR1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Because your ears were shut to my voice; no one gave attention to my out-stretched hand; </span>
<span class='v PR1_25' data-id='PR1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>You were not controlled by my guiding, and would have nothing to do with my sharp words: </span>
<span class='v PR1_26' data-id='PR1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So in the day of your trouble I will be laughing; I will make sport of your fear; </span>
<span class='v PR1_27' data-id='PR1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>When your fear comes on you like a storm, and your trouble like a rushing wind; when pain and sorrow come on you. </span>
<span class='v PR1_28' data-id='PR1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then I will give no answer to their cries; searching for me early, they will not see me: </span>
<span class='v PR1_29' data-id='PR1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For they were haters of knowledge, and did not give their hearts to the fear of the Lord: </span>
<span class='v PR1_30' data-id='PR1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They had no desire for my teaching, and my words of protest were as nothing to them. </span>
<span class='v PR1_31' data-id='PR1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So the fruit of their way will be their food, and with the designs of their hearts they will be made full. </span>
<span class='v PR1_32' data-id='PR1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For the turning back of the simple from teaching will be the cause of their death, and the peace of the foolish will be their destruction. </span>
<span class='v PR1_33' data-id='PR1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But whoever gives ear to me will take his rest safely, living in peace without fear of evil. </span></div></div>
