<span class='v EC4_1' data-id='EC4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And again I saw all the cruel things which are done under the sun; there was the weeping of those who have evil done to them, and they had no comforter: and from the hands of the evil-doers there went out power, but they had no comforter. </span>
<span class='v EC4_2' data-id='EC4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So my praise was for the dead who have gone to their death, more than for the living who still have life. </span>
<span class='v EC4_3' data-id='EC4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yes, happier than the dead or the living seemed he who has not ever been, who has not seen the evil which is done under the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC4_4' data-id='EC4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I saw that the cause of all the work and of everything which is done well was man's envy of his neighbour. This again is to no purpose and a desire for wind. </span>
<span class='v EC4_5' data-id='EC4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The foolish man, folding his hands, takes the flesh of his body for food. </span>
<span class='v EC4_6' data-id='EC4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>One hand full of rest is better than two hands full of trouble and desire for wind. </span>
<span class='v EC4_7' data-id='EC4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I came back, and I saw an example of what is to no purpose under the sun. </span>
<span class='v EC4_8' data-id='EC4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>It is one who is by himself, without a second, and without son or brother; but there is no end to all his work, and he has never enough of wealth. For whom, then, am I working and keeping myself from pleasure? This again is to no purpose, and a bitter work. </span>
<span class='v EC4_9' data-id='EC4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their work. </span>
<span class='v EC4_10' data-id='EC4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And if one has a fall, the other will give him a hand; but unhappy is the man who is by himself, because he has no helper. </span>
<span class='v EC4_11' data-id='EC4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So again, if two are sleeping together they are warm, but how may one be warm by himself? </span>
<span class='v EC4_12' data-id='EC4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And two attacked by one would be safe, and three cords twisted together are not quickly broken. </span>
<span class='v EC4_13' data-id='EC4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>A young man who is poor and wise is better than a king who is old and foolish and will not be guided by the wisdom of others. </span>
<span class='v EC4_14' data-id='EC4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Because out of a prison the young man comes to be king, though by birth he was only a poor man in the kingdom. </span>
<span class='v EC4_15' data-id='EC4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I saw all the living under the sun round the young man who was to be ruler in place of the king. </span>
<span class='v EC4_16' data-id='EC4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>There was no end of all the people, of all those whose head he was, but they who come later will have no delight in him. This again is to no purpose and desire for wind. </span></div></div>
