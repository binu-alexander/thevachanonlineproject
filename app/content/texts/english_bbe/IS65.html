<span class='v IS65_1' data-id='IS65_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I have been ready to give an answer to those who did not make prayer to me; I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me; I said, Here am I, here am I, to a nation which gave no respect to my name. </span>
<span class='v IS65_2' data-id='IS65_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people, who go in an evil way, after the purposes of their hearts; </span>
<span class='v IS65_3' data-id='IS65_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>A people who make me angry every day, making offerings in gardens, and burning perfumes on bricks. </span>
<span class='v IS65_4' data-id='IS65_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Who are seated in the resting-places of the dead, and by night are in the secret places; who take pig's flesh for food, and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels. </span>
<span class='v IS65_5' data-id='IS65_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Who say, Keep away, do not come near me, for fear that I make you holy: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire burning all day. </span>
<span class='v IS65_6' data-id='IS65_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>See, it is recorded before me, says the Lord: I will not keep back my hand, till I have sent punishment, </span>
<span class='v IS65_7' data-id='IS65_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For their sins and the sins of their fathers, who were burning perfumes on the mountains, and saying evil things against me on the hills: so I will take the measure of their sins, and will send the punishment for them into their breast. </span>
<span class='v IS65_8' data-id='IS65_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This is the word of the Lord: As the new wine is seen in the grapes, and they say, Do not send destruction on it, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants, in order that I may not put an end to them all. </span>
<span class='v IS65_9' data-id='IS65_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage: and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves, and my servants will have their resting-place there. </span>
<span class='v IS65_10' data-id='IS65_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Sharon will be a grass-land for the flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for the herds: for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me. </span>
<span class='v IS65_11' data-id='IS65_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate; </span>
<span class='v IS65_12' data-id='IS65_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Your fate will be the sword, and you will all go down to death: because when my voice came to you, you made no answer; you did not give ear to my word; but you did what was evil in my eyes, desiring what was not pleasing to me. </span>
<span class='v IS65_13' data-id='IS65_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this cause says the Lord God, My servants will have food, but you will be in need of food: my servants will have drink, but you will be dry: my servants will have joy, but you will be shamed: </span>
<span class='v IS65_14' data-id='IS65_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts, but you will be crying for sorrow, and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit. </span>
<span class='v IS65_15' data-id='IS65_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And your name will become a curse to my people, and the Lord God will put you to death, and give his servants another name: </span>
<span class='v IS65_16' data-id='IS65_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God, and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God; because the past troubles are gone out of mind, and because they are covered from my eyes. </span>
<span class='v IS65_17' data-id='IS65_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For see, I am making a new heaven and a new earth: and the past things will be gone completely out of mind. </span>
<span class='v IS65_18' data-id='IS65_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making; for I am making Jerusalem a delight, and her people a joy. </span>
<span class='v IS65_19' data-id='IS65_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I will be glad over Jerusalem, and have joy in my people: and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her, or the voice of grief. </span>
<span class='v IS65_20' data-id='IS65_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short, or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure: for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old, and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed. </span>
<span class='v IS65_21' data-id='IS65_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they will be building houses and living in them; planting vine-gardens and getting the fruit of them. </span>
<span class='v IS65_22' data-id='IS65_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>They will no longer be building for the use of others, or planting for others to have the fruit: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands. </span>
<span class='v IS65_23' data-id='IS65_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Their work will not be for nothing, and they will not give birth to children for destruction; for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing, and their offspring will be with them. </span>
<span class='v IS65_24' data-id='IS65_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And before they make their request I will give an answer, and while they are still making prayer to me, I will give ear. </span>
<span class='v IS65_25' data-id='IS65_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The wolf and the lamb will take their food together, and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox: but dust will be the snake's food. There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain, says the Lord. </span></div></div>
