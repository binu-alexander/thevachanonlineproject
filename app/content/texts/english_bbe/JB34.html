<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB34_1' data-id='JB34_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Elihu made answer and said, </span>
<span class='v JB34_2' data-id='JB34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Give ear, you wise, to my words; and you who have knowledge, give attention to me; </span>
<span class='v JB34_3' data-id='JB34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For words are tested by the ear, as food is tasted by the mouth. </span>
<span class='v JB34_4' data-id='JB34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let us make the decision for ourselves as to what is right; let us have the knowledge among ourselves of what is good. </span>
<span class='v JB34_5' data-id='JB34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For Job has said, I am upright, and it is God who has taken away my right; </span>
<span class='v JB34_6' data-id='JB34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Though I am right, still I am in pain; my wound may not be made well, though I have done no wrong. </span>
<span class='v JB34_7' data-id='JB34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>What man is like Job, a man who freely makes sport of God, </span>
<span class='v JB34_8' data-id='JB34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And goes in the company of evil-doers, walking in the way of sinners? </span>
<span class='v JB34_9' data-id='JB34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For he has said, It is no profit to a man to take delight in God. </span>
<span class='v JB34_10' data-id='JB34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now then, you wise, take note; you men of knowledge, give ear to me. Let it be far from God to do evil, and from the Ruler of all to do wrong. </span>
<span class='v JB34_11' data-id='JB34_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he gives to every man the reward of his work, and sees that he gets the fruit of his ways. </span>
<span class='v JB34_12' data-id='JB34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Truly, God does not do evil, and the Ruler of all is not a false judge. </span>
<span class='v JB34_13' data-id='JB34_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who put the earth into his care, or made him responsible for the world? </span>
<span class='v JB34_14' data-id='JB34_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If he made his spirit come back to him, taking his breath into himself again, </span>
<span class='v JB34_15' data-id='JB34_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All flesh would come to an end together, and man would go back to the dust. </span>
<span class='v JB34_16' data-id='JB34_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If you are wise, take note of this; give ear to the voice of my words. </span>
<span class='v JB34_17' data-id='JB34_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>How may a hater of right be a ruler? and will you say that the upright Ruler of all is evil? </span>
<span class='v JB34_18' data-id='JB34_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He who says to a king, You are an evil-doer; and to rulers, You are sinners; </span>
<span class='v JB34_19' data-id='JB34_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Who has no respect for rulers, and who gives no more attention to those who have wealth than to the poor, for they are all the work of his hands. </span>
<span class='v JB34_20' data-id='JB34_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Suddenly they come to an end, even in the middle of the night: the blow comes on the men of wealth, and they are gone, and the strong are taken away without the hand of man. </span>
<span class='v JB34_21' data-id='JB34_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps. </span>
<span class='v JB34_22' data-id='JB34_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>There is no dark place, and no thick cloud, in which the workers of evil may take cover. </span>
<span class='v JB34_23' data-id='JB34_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For he does not give man a fixed time to come before him to be judged. </span>
<span class='v JB34_24' data-id='JB34_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He sends the strong to destruction without searching out their cause, and puts others in their place. </span>
<span class='v JB34_25' data-id='JB34_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For he has knowledge of their works, overturning them in the night, so that they are crushed. </span>
<span class='v JB34_26' data-id='JB34_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>The evil-doers are broken by his wrath, he puts his hand on them with force before the eyes of all onlookers. </span>
<span class='v JB34_27' data-id='JB34_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Because they did not go after him, and took no note of his ways, </span>
<span class='v JB34_28' data-id='JB34_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So that the cry of the poor might come up to him, and the prayer of those in need come to his ears. </span>
<span class='v JB34_29' data-id='JB34_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> ... </span>
<span class='v JB34_30' data-id='JB34_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span> ... </span>
<span class='v JB34_31' data-id='JB34_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> ... </span>
<span class='v JB34_32' data-id='JB34_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> ... </span>
<span class='v JB34_33' data-id='JB34_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> ... </span>
<span class='v JB34_34' data-id='JB34_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Men of knowledge, and all wise men, hearing me, will say, </span>
<span class='v JB34_35' data-id='JB34_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Job's words do not come from knowledge; they are not the fruit of wisdom. </span>
<span class='v JB34_36' data-id='JB34_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>May Job be tested to the end, because his answers have been like those of evil men. </span>
<span class='v JB34_37' data-id='JB34_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>For in addition to his sin, he is uncontrolled in heart; before our eyes he makes sport of God, increasing his words against him. </span></div></div>
