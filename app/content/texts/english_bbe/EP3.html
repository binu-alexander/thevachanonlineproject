<span class='v EP3_1' data-id='EP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for you Gentiles, </span>
<span class='v EP3_2' data-id='EP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>If that ordering of the grace of God has come to your knowledge, which was given to me for you, </span>
<span class='v EP3_3' data-id='EP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>How by revelation the secret was made clear to me, as I said before in a short letter, </span>
<span class='v EP3_4' data-id='EP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>By the reading of which you will be clear about my knowledge of the secret of Christ; </span>
<span class='v EP3_5' data-id='EP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Which in other generations was not given to the sons of men, but the revelation of it has now been made to his holy Apostles and prophets in the Spirit; </span>
<span class='v EP3_6' data-id='EP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Which is that the Gentiles have a part in the heritage, and in the same body, and in the same hope in Christ through the good news, </span>
<span class='v EP3_7' data-id='EP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Of which I was made a preacher, through that grace of God which was given to me in the measure of the working of his power. </span>
<span class='v EP3_8' data-id='EP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, was this grace given, so that I might make clear to the Gentiles the good news of the unending wealth of Christ: </span>
<span class='v EP3_9' data-id='EP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And make all men see what is the ordering of the secret which from the first has been kept in God who made all things; </span>
<span class='v EP3_10' data-id='EP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavens might be made clear through the church the wide-shining wisdom of God, </span>
<span class='v EP3_11' data-id='EP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Which is seen in his eternal purpose in Christ Jesus our Lord: </span>
<span class='v EP3_12' data-id='EP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>By whom we come near to God without fear through faith in him. </span>
<span class='v EP3_13' data-id='EP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this reason it is my prayer that you may not become feeble because of my troubles for you, which are your glory. </span>
<span class='v EP3_14' data-id='EP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this cause I go down on my knees before the Father, </span>
<span class='v EP3_15' data-id='EP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>From whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, </span>
<span class='v EP3_16' data-id='EP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>That in the wealth of his glory he would make you strong with power through his Spirit in your hearts; </span>
<span class='v EP3_17' data-id='EP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So that Christ may have his place in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and based in love, </span>
<span class='v EP3_18' data-id='EP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>May have strength to see with all the saints how wide and long and high and deep it is, </span>
<span class='v EP3_19' data-id='EP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And to have knowledge of the love of Christ which is outside all knowledge, so that you may be made complete as God himself is complete. </span>
<span class='v EP3_20' data-id='EP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now to him who is able to do in full measure more than all our desires or thoughts, through the power which is working in us, </span>
<span class='v EP3_21' data-id='EP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations for ever and ever. So be it. </span></div></div>
