<span class='v DT30_2' data-id='DT30_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And your hearts are turned again to the Lord your God, and you give ear to his word which I give you today, you and your children, with all your heart and with all your soul: </span>
<span class='v DT30_3' data-id='DT30_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the Lord will have pity on you, changing your fate, and taking you back again from among all the nations where you have been forced to go. </span>
<span class='v DT30_4' data-id='DT30_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Even if those who have been forced out are living in the farthest part of heaven, the Lord your God will go in search of you, and take you back; </span>
<span class='v DT30_5' data-id='DT30_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Placing you again in the land of your fathers as your heritage; and he will do you good, increasing you till you are more in number than your fathers were. </span>
<span class='v DT30_6' data-id='DT30_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord your God will give to you and to your seed a circumcision of the heart, so that, loving him with all your heart and all your soul, you may have life. </span>
<span class='v DT30_7' data-id='DT30_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the Lord your God will put all these curses on those who are against you, and on your haters who put a cruel yoke on you. </span>
<span class='v DT30_8' data-id='DT30_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And you will again give ear to the voice of the Lord, and do all his orders which I have given you today. </span>
<span class='v DT30_9' data-id='DT30_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the Lord your God will make you fertile in all good things, blessing the work of your hands, and the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your cattle, and the fruit of your land: for the Lord will have joy in you, as he had in your fathers: </span>
<span class='v DT30_10' data-id='DT30_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If you give ear to the voice of the Lord your God, keeping his orders and his laws which are recorded in this book of the law, and turning to the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul. </span>
<span class='v DT30_11' data-id='DT30_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For these orders which I have given you today are not strange and secret, and are not far away. </span>
<span class='v DT30_12' data-id='DT30_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They are not in heaven, for you to say, Who will go up to heaven for us and give us knowledge of them so that we may do them? </span>

<span class='v DT30_14' data-id='DT30_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may do it. </span>
<span class='v DT30_15' data-id='DT30_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>See, I have put before you today, life and good, and death and evil; </span>
<span class='v DT30_16' data-id='DT30_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In giving you orders today to have love for the Lord your God, to go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions, so that you may have life and be increased, and that the blessing of the Lord your God may be with you in the land where you are going, the land of your heritage. </span>
<span class='v DT30_17' data-id='DT30_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if your heart is turned away and your ear is shut, and you go after those who would make you servants and worshippers of other gods: </span>
<span class='v DT30_18' data-id='DT30_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I give witness against you this day that destruction will certainly be your fate, and your days will be cut short in the land where you are going, the land of your heritage on the other side of Jordan. </span>
<span class='v DT30_19' data-id='DT30_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Let heaven and earth be my witnesses against you this day that I have put before you life and death, a blessing and a curse: so take life for yourselves and for your seed: </span>
<span class='v DT30_20' data-id='DT30_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In loving the Lord your God, hearing his voice and being true to him: for he is your life and by him will your days be long: so that you may go on living in the land which the Lord gave by an oath to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. </span></div></div>
