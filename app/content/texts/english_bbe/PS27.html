<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS27_2' data-id='PS27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When evil-doers, even my haters, came on me to put an end to me, they were broken and put to shame. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS27_3' data-id='PS27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Even if an army came against me with its tents, my heart would have no fear: if war was made on me, my faith would not be moved. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS27_4' data-id='PS27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>One prayer have I made to the Lord, and this is my heart's desire; that I may have a place in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, looking on his glory, and getting wisdom in his Temple. </span></div>

<span class='v PS27_5' data-id='PS27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For in the time of trouble he will keep me safe in his tent: in the secret place of his tent he will keep me from men's eyes; high on a rock he will put me. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS27_6' data-id='PS27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And now my head will be lifted up higher than my haters who are round me: because of this I will make offerings of joy in his tent; I will make a song, truly I will make a song of praise to the Lord. </span></div>

<span class='v PS27_7' data-id='PS27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>O Lord, let the voice of my cry come to your ears: have mercy on me, and give me an answer. </span></div>

<span class='v PS27_8' data-id='PS27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When you said, Make search for my face, my heart said to you, For your face will I make my search. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v PS27_9' data-id='PS27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let not your face be covered from me; do not put away your servant in wrath; you have been my help: do not give me up or take your support from me, O God of my salvation. </span></div>
