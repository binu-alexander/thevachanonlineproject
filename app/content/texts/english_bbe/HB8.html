<span class='v HB8_1' data-id='HB8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now of the things we are saying this is the chief point: We have such a high priest, who has taken his place at the right hand of God's high seat of glory in heaven, </span>
<span class='v HB8_2' data-id='HB8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>As a servant of the holy things and of the true Tent, which was put up by God, not by man. </span>
<span class='v HB8_3' data-id='HB8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now every high priest is given authority to take to God the things which are given and to make offerings; so that it is necessary for this man, like them, to have something for an offering. </span>
<span class='v HB8_4' data-id='HB8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If he had been on earth he would not have been a priest at all, because there are other priests who make the offerings ordered by the law; </span>
<span class='v HB8_5' data-id='HB8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Being servants of that which is a copy and an image of the things in heaven, as Moses, when he was about to make the Tent, had special orders from God: for, See, he said, that you make everything like the design which you saw in the mountain. </span>
<span class='v HB8_6' data-id='HB8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But now his position as priest is higher. because through him God has made a better agreement with man, based on the giving of better things. </span>
<span class='v HB8_7' data-id='HB8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For if that first agreement had been as good as possible, there would have been no place for a second. </span>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For, protesting against them, he says, See, the days are coming when I will make a new agreement with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah; </span>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Not like the agreement which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand, to be their guide out of the land of Egypt; for they did not keep the agreement with me, and I gave them up, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this is the agreement which I will make with the people of Israel after those days: I will put my laws into their minds, writing them in their hearts: and I will be their God, and they will be my people: </span>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And there will be no need for every man to be teaching his brother, or his neighbour, saying, This is the knowledge of the Lord: for they will all have knowledge of me, great and small. </span>
<span class='v HB8_12' data-id='HB8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I will have mercy on their evil-doing, and I will not keep their sins in mind. </span>
<span class='v HB8_13' data-id='HB8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When he says, A new agreement, he has made the first agreement old. But anything which is getting old and past use will not be seen much longer. </span></div></div>
