<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our dear helper in the faith, </span>
<span class='v PM1_2' data-id='PM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And to Apphia, our sister, and to Archippus, our brother in God's army, and to the church in your house: </span>
<span class='v PM1_3' data-id='PM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_4' data-id='PM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I give praise to God at all times and make prayer for you, </span>
<span class='v PM1_5' data-id='PM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Hearing of the love and the faith which you have to the Lord Jesus and to all the saints; </span>
<span class='v PM1_6' data-id='PM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That the faith which you have in common with them may be working with power, in the knowledge of every good thing in you, for Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_7' data-id='PM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I had great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been made strong again through you, brother. </span>
<span class='v PM1_8' data-id='PM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And so, though I might, in the name of Christ, give you orders to do what is right, </span>
<span class='v PM1_9' data-id='PM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Still, because of love, in place of an order, I make a request to you, I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner of Christ Jesus: </span>
<span class='v PM1_10' data-id='PM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>My request is for my child Onesimus, the child of my chains, </span>
<span class='v PM1_11' data-id='PM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Who in the past was of no profit to you, but now is of profit to you and to me: </span>
<span class='v PM1_12' data-id='PM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Whom I have sent back to you, him who is my very heart: </span>
<span class='v PM1_13' data-id='PM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Though my desire was to keep him with me, to be my servant in the chains of the good news, in your place: </span>
<span class='v PM1_14' data-id='PM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But without your approval I would do nothing; so that your good works might not be forced, but done freely from your heart. </span>
<span class='v PM1_15' data-id='PM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For it is possible that for this reason he was parted from you for a time, so that you might have him for ever; </span>
<span class='v PM1_16' data-id='PM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>No longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother, very dear to me specially, but much more to you, in the flesh as well as in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PM1_17' data-id='PM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If then you take me to be your friend and brother, take him in as myself. </span>
<span class='v PM1_18' data-id='PM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If he has done you any wrong or is in debt to you for anything, put it to my account. </span>
<span class='v PM1_19' data-id='PM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, writing this myself, say, I will make payment to you: and I do not say to you that you are in debt to me even for your life. </span>
<span class='v PM1_20' data-id='PM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: give new life to my heart in Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_21' data-id='PM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Being certain that you will do my desire, I am writing to you, in the knowledge that you will do even more than I say. </span>
<span class='v PM1_22' data-id='PM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And make a room ready for me; for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be given to you. </span>
<span class='v PM1_23' data-id='PM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, my brother-prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you his love; </span>
<span class='v PM1_24' data-id='PM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my brother-workers. </span>
<span class='v PM1_25' data-id='PM1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. So be it. </span></div></div>
