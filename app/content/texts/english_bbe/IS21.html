<span class='v IS21_1' data-id='IS21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word about the waste land. As storm-winds in the South go rushing through, it comes from the waste land, from the land greatly to be feared. </span>
<span class='v IS21_2' data-id='IS21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>A vision of fear comes before my eyes; the worker of deceit goes on in his false way, and the waster goes on making waste. Up! Elam; to the attack! Media; I have put an end to her sorrow. </span>
<span class='v IS21_3' data-id='IS21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this cause I am full of bitter grief; pains like the pains of a woman in childbirth have come on me: I am bent down with sorrow at what comes to my ears; I am shocked by what I see. </span>
<span class='v IS21_4' data-id='IS21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>My mind is wandering, fear has overcome me: the evening of my desire has been turned into shaking for me. </span>
<span class='v IS21_5' data-id='IS21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They make ready the table, they put down the covers, they take food and drink. Up! you captains; put oil on your breastplates. </span>
<span class='v IS21_6' data-id='IS21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For so has the Lord said to me, Go, let a watchman be placed; let him give word of what he sees: </span>
<span class='v IS21_7' data-id='IS21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when he sees war-carriages, horsemen by twos, war-carriages with asses, war-carriages with camels, let him give special attention. </span>
<span class='v IS21_8' data-id='IS21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the watchman gave a loud cry, O my lord, I am on the watchtower all day, and am placed in my watch every night: </span>
<span class='v IS21_9' data-id='IS21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>See, here come war-carriages with men, horsemen by twos: and in answer he said, Babylon is made low, is made low, and all her images are broken on the earth. </span>
<span class='v IS21_10' data-id='IS21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>O my crushed ones, the grain of my floor! I have given you the word which came to me from the Lord of armies, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v IS21_11' data-id='IS21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The word about Edom. A voice comes to me from Seir, Watchman, how far gone is the night? how far gone is the night? </span>
<span class='v IS21_12' data-id='IS21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The watchman says, The morning has come, but night is still to come: if you have questions to put, put them, and come back again. </span>
<span class='v IS21_13' data-id='IS21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The word about Arabia. In the thick woods of Arabia will be your night's resting-place, O travelling bands of Dedanites! </span>
<span class='v IS21_14' data-id='IS21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Give water to him who is in need of water; give bread, O men of the land of Tema, to those in flight. </span>
<span class='v IS21_15' data-id='IS21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For they are in flight from the sharp sword, and the bent bow, and from the trouble of war. </span>
<span class='v IS21_16' data-id='IS21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For so has the Lord said to me, In a year, by the years of a servant working for payment, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end: </span>
<span class='v IS21_17' data-id='IS21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the bowmen, the men of war of the children of Kedar, will be small in number: for the Lord, the God of Israel, has said it. </span></div></div>
