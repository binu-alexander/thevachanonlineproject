<span class='v GN13_1' data-id='GN13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Abram went up out of Egypt with his wife and all he had, and Lot with him, and they came in to the South. </span>
<span class='v GN13_2' data-id='GN13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now Abram had great wealth of cattle and silver and gold. </span>
<span class='v GN13_3' data-id='GN13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And travelling on from the South, he came to Beth-el, to the place where his tent had been before, between Beth-el and Ai; </span>
<span class='v GN13_4' data-id='GN13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>To the place where he had made his first altar, and there Abram gave worship to the name of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v GN13_5' data-id='GN13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Lot, who went with him, had flocks and herds and tents; </span>
<span class='v GN13_6' data-id='GN13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So that the land was not wide enough for the two of them: their property was so great that there was not room for them together. </span>
<span class='v GN13_7' data-id='GN13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And there was an argument between the keepers of Abram's cattle and the keepers of Lot's cattle: at that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were still living in the land. </span>
<span class='v GN13_8' data-id='GN13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then Abram said to Lot, Let there be no argument between me and you, and between my herdmen and your herdmen, for we are brothers. </span>
<span class='v GN13_9' data-id='GN13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Is not all the land before you? then let us go our separate ways: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you take the right, I will go to the left. </span>
<span class='v GN13_10' data-id='GN13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Lot, lifting up his eyes and looking an the valley of Jordan, saw that it was well watered everywhere, before the Lord had sent destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah; it was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, on the way to Zoar. </span>
<span class='v GN13_11' data-id='GN13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Lot took for himself all the valley of Jordan, and went to the east, and they were parted from one another. </span>
<span class='v GN13_12' data-id='GN13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Abram went on living in the land of Canaan, and Lot went to the lowland towns, moving his tent as far as Sodom. </span>
<span class='v GN13_13' data-id='GN13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now the men of Sodom were evil, and great sinners before the Lord. </span>
<span class='v GN13_14' data-id='GN13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the Lord had said to Abram, after Lot was parted from him, From this place where you are take a look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west: </span>
<span class='v GN13_15' data-id='GN13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed for ever. </span>
<span class='v GN13_16' data-id='GN13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I will make your children like the dust of the earth, so that if the dust of the earth may be numbered, then will your children be numbered. </span>
<span class='v GN13_17' data-id='GN13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Come, go through all the land from one end to the other for I will give it to you. </span>
<span class='v GN13_18' data-id='GN13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Abram, moving his tent, came and made his living-place by the holy tree of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and made an altar there to the Lord. </span></div></div>
