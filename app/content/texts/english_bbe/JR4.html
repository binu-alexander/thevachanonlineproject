<span class='v JR4_1' data-id='JR4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If you will come back, O Israel, says the Lord, you will come back to me: and if you will put away your disgusting ways, you will not be sent away from before me. </span>
<span class='v JR4_2' data-id='JR4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And you will take your oath, By the living Lord, in good faith and wisdom and righteousness; and the nations will make use of you as a blessing, and in you will they take a pride. </span>
<span class='v JR4_3' data-id='JR4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem: Get your unworked land ploughed up, do not put in your seeds among thorns. </span>
<span class='v JR4_4' data-id='JR4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Undergo a circumcision of the heart, you men of Judah and people of Jerusalem: or my wrath may come out like fire, burning so that no one is able to put it out, because of the evil of your doings. </span>
<span class='v JR4_5' data-id='JR4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Say openly in Judah, give it out in Jerusalem, and say, Let the horn be sounded in the land: crying out in a loud voice, Come together, and let us go into the walled towns. </span>
<span class='v JR4_6' data-id='JR4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Put up a flag for a sign to Zion: go in flight so that you may be safe, waiting no longer: for I will send evil from the north, and a great destruction. </span>
<span class='v JR4_7' data-id='JR4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>A lion has gone up from his secret place in the woods, and one who makes waste the nations is on his way; he has gone out from his place, to make your land unpeopled, so that your towns will be made waste, with no man living in them. </span>
<span class='v JR4_8' data-id='JR4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For this put on haircloth, with weeping and loud crying: for the burning wrath of the Lord is not turned back from us. </span>
<span class='v JR4_9' data-id='JR4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And it will come about in that day, says the Lord, that the heart of the king will be dead in him, and the hearts of the rulers; and the priests will be overcome with fear, and the prophets with wonder. </span>
<span class='v JR4_10' data-id='JR4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then said I, Ah, Lord God! your words were not true when you said to this people and to Jerusalem, You will have peace; when the sword has come even to the soul. </span>
<span class='v JR4_11' data-id='JR4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A burning wind from the open hilltops in the waste land is blowing on the daughter of my people, not for separating or cleaning the grain; </span>
<span class='v JR4_12' data-id='JR4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>A full wind will come for me: and now I will give my decision against them. </span>
<span class='v JR4_13' data-id='JR4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>See, he will come up like the clouds, and his war-carriages like the storm-wind: his horses are quicker than eagles. Sorrow is ours, for destruction has come on us. </span>
<span class='v JR4_14' data-id='JR4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>O Jerusalem, make your heart clean from evil, so that you may have salvation. How long are evil purposes to have a resting-place in you? </span>
<span class='v JR4_15' data-id='JR4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For a voice is sounding from Dan, giving out evil from the hills of Ephraim: </span>
<span class='v JR4_16' data-id='JR4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Make this come to the minds of the nations, make a statement openly against Jerusalem, that attackers are coming from a far country and their voices will be loud against the towns of Judah. </span>
<span class='v JR4_17' data-id='JR4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Like keepers of a field they are against her on every side; because she has been fighting against me, says the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JR4_18' data-id='JR4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Your ways and your doings have made these things come on you; this is your sin; truly it is bitter, going deep into your heart. </span>
<span class='v JR4_19' data-id='JR4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>My soul, my soul! I am pained to my inmost heart; my heart is troubled in me; I am not able to be quiet, because the sound of the horn, the note of war, has come to my ears. </span>
<span class='v JR4_20' data-id='JR4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>News is given of destruction on destruction; all the land is made waste: suddenly my tents, straight away my curtains, are made waste. </span>
<span class='v JR4_21' data-id='JR4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>How long will I go on seeing the flag and hearing the sound of the war-horn? </span>
<span class='v JR4_22' data-id='JR4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For my people are foolish, they have no knowledge of me; they are evil-minded children, without sense, all of them: they are wise in evil-doing, but have no knowledge of doing good. </span>
<span class='v JR4_23' data-id='JR4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Looking at the earth, I saw that it was waste and without form; and to the heavens, that they had no light. </span>
<span class='v JR4_24' data-id='JR4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Looking at the mountains, I saw them shaking, and all the hills were moved about. </span>
<span class='v JR4_25' data-id='JR4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Looking, I saw that there was no man, and all the birds of heaven had gone in flight. </span>
<span class='v JR4_26' data-id='JR4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Looking, I saw that the fertile field was a waste, and all its towns were broken down before the Lord and before his burning wrath. </span>
<span class='v JR4_27' data-id='JR4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For this is what the Lord has said: All the land will become a waste; I will make destruction complete. </span>
<span class='v JR4_28' data-id='JR4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>The earth will be weeping for this, and the heavens on high will be black: because I have said it, and I will not go back from it; it is my purpose, and it will not be changed. </span>
<span class='v JR4_29' data-id='JR4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>All the land is in flight because of the noise of the horsemen and the bowmen; they have taken cover in the woodland and up on the rocks: every town has been given up, not a man is living in them. </span>
<span class='v JR4_30' data-id='JR4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And you, when you are made waste, what will you do? Though you are clothed in red, though you make yourself beautiful with ornaments of gold, though you make your eyes wide with paint, it is for nothing that you make yourself fair; your lovers have no more desire for you, they have designs on your life. </span>
<span class='v JR4_31' data-id='JR4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>A voice has come to my ears like the voice of a woman in birth-pains, the pain of one giving birth to her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, fighting for breath, stretching out her hands, saying, Now sorrow is mine! for my strength is gone from me before the takers of life. </span></div></div>
