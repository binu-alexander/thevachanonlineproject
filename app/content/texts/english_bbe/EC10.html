<span class='v EC10_4' data-id='EC10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If the wrath of the ruler is against you, keep in your place; in him who keeps quiet even great sins may be overlooked. </span>
<span class='v EC10_5' data-id='EC10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, like an error which comes by chance from a ruler: </span>
<span class='v EC10_6' data-id='EC10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The foolish are placed in high positions, but men of wealth are kept low. </span>
<span class='v EC10_7' data-id='EC10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have seen servants on horses, and rulers walking on the earth as servants. </span>
<span class='v EC10_8' data-id='EC10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He who makes a hole for others will himself go into it, and for him who makes a hole through a wall the bite of a snake will be a punishment. </span>
<span class='v EC10_9' data-id='EC10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He who gets out stones from the earth will be damaged by them, and in the cutting of wood there is danger. </span>
<span class='v EC10_10' data-id='EC10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If the iron has no edge, and he does not make it sharp, then he has to put out more strength; but wisdom makes things go well. </span>
<span class='v EC10_11' data-id='EC10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If a snake gives a bite before the word of power is said, then there is no longer any use in the word of power. </span>
<span class='v EC10_12' data-id='EC10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The words of a wise man's mouth are sweet to all, but the lips of a foolish man are his destruction. </span>
<span class='v EC10_13' data-id='EC10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The first words of his mouth are foolish, and the end of his talk is evil crime. </span>
<span class='v EC10_14' data-id='EC10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The foolish are full of words; man has no knowledge of what will be; and who is able to say what will be after him? </span>
<span class='v EC10_15' data-id='EC10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The work of the foolish will be a weariness to him, because he has no knowledge of the way to the town. </span>

<span class='v EC10_18' data-id='EC10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When no work is done the roof goes in, and when the hands do nothing water comes into the house. </span>
<span class='v EC10_19' data-id='EC10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>A feast is for laughing, and wine makes glad the heart; but by the one and the other money is wasted. </span>
<span class='v EC10_20' data-id='EC10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Say not a curse against the king, even in your thoughts; and even secretly say not a curse against the man of wealth; because a bird of the air will take the voice, and that which has wings will give news of it. </span></div></div>
