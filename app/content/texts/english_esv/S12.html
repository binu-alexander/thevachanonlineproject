<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_11' data-id='S12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the LORD in the presence of Eli the priest. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Eli's Worthless Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_12' data-id='S12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men. They did not know the LORD. </span>
<span class='v S12_13' data-id='S12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, </span>
<span class='v S12_14' data-id='S12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot. All that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there. </span>
<span class='v S12_15' data-id='S12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give meat for the priest to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw.” </span>
<span class='v S12_16' data-id='S12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And if the man said to him, “Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish,” he would say, “No, you must give it now, and if not, I will take it by force.” </span>
<span class='v S12_17' data-id='S12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_18' data-id='S12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy clothed with a linen ephod. </span>
<span class='v S12_19' data-id='S12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. </span>
<span class='v S12_20' data-id='S12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say, “May the LORD give you children by this woman for the petition she asked of the LORD.” So then they would return to their home. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_21' data-id='S12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Indeed the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the young man Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Eli Rebukes His Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_22' data-id='S12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Now Eli was very old, and he kept hearing all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving at the entrance to the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v S12_23' data-id='S12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people. </span>
<span class='v S12_24' data-id='S12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad. </span>
<span class='v S12_25' data-id='S12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>If someone sins against a man, God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to the voice of their father, for it was the will of the LORD to put them to death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_26' data-id='S12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now the young man Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and also with man. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The LORD Rejects Eli's Household </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S12_27' data-id='S12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And there came a man of God to Eli and said to him, “Thus the LORD has said, ‘Did I indeed reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh? </span>
<span class='v S12_28' data-id='S12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel. </span>
<span class='v S12_29' data-id='S12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Why then do you scorn my sacrifices and my offerings that I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?’ </span>
<span class='v S12_30' data-id='S12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: ‘I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,’ but now the LORD declares: ‘Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. </span>
<span class='v S12_31' data-id='S12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. </span>
<span class='v S12_32' data-id='S12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity that shall be bestowed on Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever. </span>
<span class='v S12_33' data-id='S12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The only one of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep his eyes out to grieve his heart, and all the descendants of your house shall die by the sword of men. </span>
<span class='v S12_34' data-id='S12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And this that shall come upon your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day. </span>
<span class='v S12_35' data-id='S12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed forever. </span>
<span class='v S12_36' data-id='S12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread and shall say, “Please put me in one of the priests' places, that I may eat a morsel of bread.” ’ ” </span></div></div>
