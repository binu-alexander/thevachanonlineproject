<div class='s'>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_1' data-id='LK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands. </span>
<span class='v LK6_2' data-id='LK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?” </span>
<span class='v LK6_3' data-id='LK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: </span>
<span class='v LK6_4' data-id='LK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>how he entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those with him?” </span>
<span class='v LK6_5' data-id='LK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Man with a Withered Hand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_6' data-id='LK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On another Sabbath, he entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered. </span>
<span class='v LK6_7' data-id='LK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find a reason to accuse him. </span>
<span class='v LK6_8' data-id='LK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, “Come and stand here.” And he rose and stood there. </span>
<span class='v LK6_9' data-id='LK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?” </span>
<span class='v LK6_10' data-id='LK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And after looking around at them all he said to him, “Stretch out your hand.” And he did so, and his hand was restored. </span>
<span class='v LK6_11' data-id='LK6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But they were filled with fury and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Twelve Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_12' data-id='LK6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In these days he went out to the mountain to pray, and all night he continued in prayer to God. </span>
<span class='v LK6_13' data-id='LK6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And when day came, he called his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles: </span>
<span class='v LK6_14' data-id='LK6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip, and Bartholomew, </span>
<span class='v LK6_15' data-id='LK6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, </span>
<span class='v LK6_16' data-id='LK6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Ministers to a Great Multitude </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_17' data-id='LK6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, </span>
<span class='v LK6_18' data-id='LK6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. And those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured. </span>
<span class='v LK6_19' data-id='LK6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came out from him and healed them all. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Beatitudes </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_20' data-id='LK6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_20' data-id='LK6_20'>“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. </span></div>

<span class='v LK6_23' data-id='LK6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets. </span></div>

<span class='v LK6_32' data-id='LK6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>“If you love those who love you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. </span>
<span class='v LK6_33' data-id='LK6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what benefit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. </span>
<span class='v LK6_34' data-id='LK6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to get back the same amount. </span>
<span class='v LK6_35' data-id='LK6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. </span>
<span class='v LK6_36' data-id='LK6_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. </span></div>

<span class='v LK6_39' data-id='LK6_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>He also told them a parable: “Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit? </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK6_43' data-id='LK6_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span> “For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit, </span>
<span class='v LK6_44' data-id='LK6_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush. </span>
<span class='v LK6_45' data-id='LK6_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure produces evil, for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. </span></div>

<span class='v LK6_48' data-id='LK6_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. </span>
<span class='v LK6_49' data-id='LK6_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.” </span></div></div>
