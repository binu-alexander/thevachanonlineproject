And they built siegeworks all around it. </span>
<span class='v K225_2' data-id='K225_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span>
<span class='v K225_3' data-id='K225_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. </span>
<span class='v K225_4' data-id='K225_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, though the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah. </span>
<span class='v K225_5' data-id='K225_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him. </span>
<span class='v K225_6' data-id='K225_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and they passed sentence on him. </span>
<span class='v K225_7' data-id='K225_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains and took him to Babylon. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K225_8' data-id='K225_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month—that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K225_9' data-id='K225_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he burned the house of the LORD and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down. </span>
<span class='v K225_10' data-id='K225_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v K225_11' data-id='K225_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the multitude, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried into exile. </span>
<span class='v K225_12' data-id='K225_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K225_13' data-id='K225_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v K225_14' data-id='K225_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service, </span>

<span class='v K225_19' data-id='K225_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and five men of the king's council who were found in the city, and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city. </span>
<span class='v K225_20' data-id='K225_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. </span>
<span class='v K225_21' data-id='K225_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land. </span></div>

<span class='v K225_22' data-id='K225_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And over the people who remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, governor. </span>
<span class='v K225_23' data-id='K225_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now when all the captains and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor, they came with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah, namely, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tan-humeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite. </span>
<span class='v K225_24' data-id='K225_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Gedaliah swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid because of the Chaldean officials. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.” </span>
<span class='v K225_25' data-id='K225_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, came with ten men and struck down Gedaliah and put him to death along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. </span>
<span class='v K225_26' data-id='K225_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. </span></div>
