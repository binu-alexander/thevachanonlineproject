<div class='s'>Elijah Denounces Ahaziah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_1' data-id='K21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_2' data-id='K21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, “Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.” </span>
<span class='v K21_3' data-id='K21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? </span>
<span class='v K21_4' data-id='K21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now therefore thus says the LORD, You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ” So Elijah went. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_5' data-id='K21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, “Why have you returned?” </span>
<span class='v K21_6' data-id='K21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, “There came a man to meet us, and said to us, ‘Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ” </span>
<span class='v K21_7' data-id='K21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?” </span>
<span class='v K21_8' data-id='K21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>They answered him, “He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist.” And he said, “It is Elijah the Tishbite.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_9' data-id='K21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Elijah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, “O man of God, the king says, ‘Come down.’ ” </span>
<span class='v K21_10' data-id='K21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But Elijah answered the captain of fifty, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_11' data-id='K21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, “O man of God, this is the king's order, ‘Come down quickly!’ ” </span>
<span class='v K21_12' data-id='K21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.” Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_13' data-id='K21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and entreated him, “O man of God, please let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight. </span>
<span class='v K21_14' data-id='K21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties, but now let my life be precious in your sight.” </span>
<span class='v K21_15' data-id='K21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.” So he arose and went down with him to the king </span>
<span class='v K21_16' data-id='K21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron—is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?—therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K21_17' data-id='K21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So he died according to the word of the LORD that Elijah had spoken. Jehoram became king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, because Ahaziah had no son. </span>
<span class='v K21_18' data-id='K21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? </span></div></div>
