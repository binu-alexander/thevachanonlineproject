<div class='s'>David Hears of Saul's Death </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_1' data-id='S21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. </span>
<span class='v S21_2' data-id='S21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. </span>
<span class='v S21_3' data-id='S21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>David said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” </span>
<span class='v S21_4' data-id='S21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, “How did it go? Tell me.” And he answered, “The people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.” </span>
<span class='v S21_5' data-id='S21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then David said to the young man who told him, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” </span>
<span class='v S21_6' data-id='S21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the young man who told him said, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. </span>
<span class='v S21_7' data-id='S21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ </span>
<span class='v S21_8' data-id='S21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ </span>
<span class='v S21_9' data-id='S21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said to me ‘Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.’ </span>
<span class='v S21_10' data-id='S21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_11' data-id='S21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. </span>
<span class='v S21_12' data-id='S21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. </span>
<span class='v S21_13' data-id='S21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And David said to the young man who told him, “Where do you come from?” And he answered, “I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.” </span>
<span class='v S21_14' data-id='S21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>David said to him, “How is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?” </span>
<span class='v S21_15' data-id='S21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” And he struck him down so that he died. </span>
<span class='v S21_16' data-id='S21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And David said to him, “Your blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD's anointed.’ ” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v S21_17' data-id='S21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son, </span>
<span class='v S21_18' data-id='S21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said: </span></div>
