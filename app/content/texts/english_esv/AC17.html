<div class='s'>Paul and Silas in Thessalonica </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC17_1' data-id='AC17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. </span>
<span class='v AC17_2' data-id='AC17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, </span>
<span class='v AC17_3' data-id='AC17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.” </span>
<span class='v AC17_4' data-id='AC17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. </span>
<span class='v AC17_5' data-id='AC17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd. </span>
<span class='v AC17_6' data-id='AC17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, </span>
<span class='v AC17_7' data-id='AC17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus.” </span>
<span class='v AC17_8' data-id='AC17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things. </span>
<span class='v AC17_9' data-id='AC17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul and Silas in Berea </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC17_10' data-id='AC17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. </span>
<span class='v AC17_11' data-id='AC17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. </span>
<span class='v AC17_12' data-id='AC17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. </span>
<span class='v AC17_13' data-id='AC17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds. </span>
<span class='v AC17_14' data-id='AC17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. </span>
<span class='v AC17_15' data-id='AC17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul in Athens </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC17_16' data-id='AC17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. </span>
<span class='v AC17_17' data-id='AC17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. </span>
<span class='v AC17_18' data-id='AC17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, “What does this babbler wish to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. </span>
<span class='v AC17_19' data-id='AC17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? </span>
<span class='v AC17_20' data-id='AC17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean.” </span>
<span class='v AC17_21' data-id='AC17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul Addresses the Areopagus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC17_22' data-id='AC17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. </span>
<span class='v AC17_23' data-id='AC17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. </span>
<span class='v AC17_24' data-id='AC17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, </span>
<span class='v AC17_25' data-id='AC17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. </span>
<span class='v AC17_26' data-id='AC17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, </span>
<span class='v AC17_27' data-id='AC17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, </span>
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>for </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'>“ ‘In him we live and move and have our being’; </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'></span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'>as even some of your own poets have said, </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC17_28' data-id='AC17_28'>“ ‘For we are indeed his offspring.’ </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC17_29' data-id='AC17_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. </span>
<span class='v AC17_30' data-id='AC17_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, </span>
<span class='v AC17_31' data-id='AC17_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC17_32' data-id='AC17_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, “We will hear you again about this.” </span>
<span class='v AC17_33' data-id='AC17_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So Paul went out from their midst. </span>
<span class='v AC17_34' data-id='AC17_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. </span></div></div>
