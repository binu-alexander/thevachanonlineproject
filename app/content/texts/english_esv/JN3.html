<div class='s'>You Must Be Born Again </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_1' data-id='JN3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. </span>
<span class='v JN3_2' data-id='JN3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.” </span>
<span class='v JN3_3' data-id='JN3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.” </span>
<span class='v JN3_4' data-id='JN3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?” </span>
<span class='v JN3_5' data-id='JN3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v JN3_6' data-id='JN3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span>
<span class='v JN3_7' data-id='JN3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born again.’ </span>
<span class='v JN3_8' data-id='JN3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_9' data-id='JN3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Nicodemus said to him, “How can these things be?” </span>
<span class='v JN3_10' data-id='JN3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things? </span>
<span class='v JN3_11' data-id='JN3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen, but you do not receive our testimony. </span>
<span class='v JN3_12' data-id='JN3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things? </span>
<span class='v JN3_13' data-id='JN3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>No one has ascended into heaven except he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v JN3_14' data-id='JN3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, </span>
<span class='v JN3_15' data-id='JN3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>that whoever believes in him may have eternal life. </span></div>
<div class='s'>For God So Loved the World </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_16' data-id='JN3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. </span>
<span class='v JN3_17' data-id='JN3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. </span>
<span class='v JN3_18' data-id='JN3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God. </span>
<span class='v JN3_19' data-id='JN3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil. </span>
<span class='v JN3_20' data-id='JN3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. </span>
<span class='v JN3_21' data-id='JN3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been carried out in God.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>John the Baptist Exalts Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_22' data-id='JN3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside, and he remained there with them and was baptizing. </span>
<span class='v JN3_23' data-id='JN3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming and being baptized </span>
<span class='v JN3_24' data-id='JN3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>(for John had not yet been put in prison). </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_25' data-id='JN3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purification. </span>
<span class='v JN3_26' data-id='JN3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you across the Jordan, to whom you bore witness—look, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.” </span>
<span class='v JN3_27' data-id='JN3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>John answered, “A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven. </span>
<span class='v JN3_28' data-id='JN3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.’ </span>
<span class='v JN3_29' data-id='JN3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete. </span>
<span class='v JN3_30' data-id='JN3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He must increase, but I must decrease.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN3_31' data-id='JN3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He who comes from above is above all. He who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks in an earthly way. He who comes from heaven is above all. </span>
<span class='v JN3_32' data-id='JN3_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony. </span>
<span class='v JN3_33' data-id='JN3_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Whoever receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true. </span>
<span class='v JN3_34' data-id='JN3_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure. </span>
<span class='v JN3_35' data-id='JN3_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. </span>
<span class='v JN3_36' data-id='JN3_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him. </span></div></div>
