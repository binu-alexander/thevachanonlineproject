<div class='s'>Preparations for Building the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K15_1' data-id='K15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. </span>
<span class='v K15_2' data-id='K15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Solomon sent word to Hiram, </span>
<span class='v K15_3' data-id='K15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. </span>
<span class='v K15_4' data-id='K15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. </span>
<span class='v K15_5' data-id='K15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And so I intend to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.’ </span>
<span class='v K15_6' data-id='K15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K15_7' data-id='K15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people.” </span>
<span class='v K15_8' data-id='K15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. </span>
<span class='v K15_9' data-id='K15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household.” </span>
<span class='v K15_10' data-id='K15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, </span>
<span class='v K15_11' data-id='K15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. </span>
<span class='v K15_12' data-id='K15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K15_13' data-id='K15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. </span>
<span class='v K15_14' data-id='K15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. </span>
<span class='v K15_15' data-id='K15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, </span>
<span class='v K15_16' data-id='K15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>besides Solomon's 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. </span>
<span class='v K15_17' data-id='K15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>At the king's command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. </span>
<span class='v K15_18' data-id='K15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. </span></div></div>
