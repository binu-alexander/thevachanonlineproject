<div class='s'>Jesus Cleanses a Leper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_1' data-id='MT8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_2' data-id='MT8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_3' data-id='MT8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. </span>
<span class='v MT8_4' data-id='MT8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Faith of a Centurion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_5' data-id='MT8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, </span>
<span class='v MT8_6' data-id='MT8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_7' data-id='MT8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_8' data-id='MT8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But the centurion replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. </span>
<span class='v MT8_9' data-id='MT8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_10' data-id='MT8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, “Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. </span>
<span class='v MT8_11' data-id='MT8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, </span>
<span class='v MT8_12' data-id='MT8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_13' data-id='MT8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed at that very moment. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_14' data-id='MT8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. </span>
<span class='v MT8_15' data-id='MT8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_16' data-id='MT8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. </span>
<span class='v MT8_17' data-id='MT8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Cost of Following Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_18' data-id='MT8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus saw a great crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. </span>
<span class='v MT8_19' data-id='MT8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span> And a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_20' data-id='MT8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_21' data-id='MT8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_22' data-id='MT8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calms a Storm </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_23' data-id='MT8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT8_24' data-id='MT8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. </span>
<span class='v MT8_25' data-id='MT8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And they went and woke him, saying, “Save us, Lord; we are perishing.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_26' data-id='MT8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?” Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. </span>
<span class='v MT8_27' data-id='MT8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the men marveled, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Two Demon-Possessed Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT8_28' data-id='MT8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. </span>
<span class='v MT8_29' data-id='MT8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And behold, they cried out, “What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” </span>
<span class='v MT8_30' data-id='MT8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. </span>
<span class='v MT8_31' data-id='MT8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And the demons begged him, saying, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs.” </span>
<span class='v MT8_32' data-id='MT8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Go.” So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. </span>
<span class='v MT8_33' data-id='MT8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. </span>
<span class='v MT8_34' data-id='MT8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region. </span></div></div>
