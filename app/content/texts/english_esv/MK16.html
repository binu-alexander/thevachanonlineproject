<span class='v MK16_2' data-id='MK16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MK16_3' data-id='MK16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?” </span>
<span class='v MK16_4' data-id='MK16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back—it was very large. </span>
<span class='v MK16_5' data-id='MK16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. </span>
<span class='v MK16_6' data-id='MK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. </span>
<span class='v MK16_7' data-id='MK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.” </span>
<span class='v MK16_8' data-id='MK16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. </span></div>

<span class='v MK16_14' data-id='MK16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. </span>
<span class='v MK16_15' data-id='MK16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. </span>
