<div class='s'>Paul in Macedonia and Greece </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_1' data-id='AC20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia. </span>
<span class='v AC20_2' data-id='AC20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece. </span>
<span class='v AC20_3' data-id='AC20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. </span>
<span class='v AC20_4' data-id='AC20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus from Berea, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus. </span>
<span class='v AC20_5' data-id='AC20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas, </span>
<span class='v AC20_6' data-id='AC20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Eutychus Raised from the Dead </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_7' data-id='AC20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight. </span>
<span class='v AC20_8' data-id='AC20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered. </span>
<span class='v AC20_9' data-id='AC20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. </span>
<span class='v AC20_10' data-id='AC20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, “Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.” </span>
<span class='v AC20_11' data-id='AC20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. </span>
<span class='v AC20_12' data-id='AC20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_13' data-id='AC20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. </span>
<span class='v AC20_14' data-id='AC20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. </span>
<span class='v AC20_15' data-id='AC20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus. </span>
<span class='v AC20_16' data-id='AC20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_17' data-id='AC20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. </span>
<span class='v AC20_18' data-id='AC20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when they came to him, he said to them: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_18' data-id='AC20_18'>“You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, </span>
<span class='v AC20_19' data-id='AC20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; </span>
<span class='v AC20_20' data-id='AC20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, </span>
<span class='v AC20_21' data-id='AC20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC20_22' data-id='AC20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, </span>
<span class='v AC20_23' data-id='AC20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. </span>
<span class='v AC20_24' data-id='AC20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. </span>
<span class='v AC20_25' data-id='AC20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. </span>
<span class='v AC20_26' data-id='AC20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, </span>
<span class='v AC20_27' data-id='AC20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. </span>
<span class='v AC20_28' data-id='AC20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. </span>
<span class='v AC20_29' data-id='AC20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; </span>
<span class='v AC20_30' data-id='AC20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. </span>
<span class='v AC20_31' data-id='AC20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears. </span>
<span class='v AC20_32' data-id='AC20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. </span>
<span class='v AC20_33' data-id='AC20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel. </span>
<span class='v AC20_34' data-id='AC20_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. </span>
<span class='v AC20_35' data-id='AC20_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC20_36' data-id='AC20_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. </span>
<span class='v AC20_37' data-id='AC20_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, </span>
<span class='v AC20_38' data-id='AC20_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship. </span></div></div>
