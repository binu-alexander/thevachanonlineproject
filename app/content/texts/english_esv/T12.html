<span class='v T12_1' data-id='T12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, </span>
<span class='v T12_2' data-id='T12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. </span>
<span class='v T12_3' data-id='T12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, </span>
<span class='v T12_4' data-id='T12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. </span>
<span class='v T12_5' data-id='T12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v T12_6' data-id='T12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time. </span>
<span class='v T12_7' data-id='T12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T12_8' data-id='T12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; </span>
<span class='v T12_9' data-id='T12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, </span>
<span class='v T12_10' data-id='T12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but with what is proper for women who profess godliness—with good works. </span>
<span class='v T12_11' data-id='T12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness. </span>
<span class='v T12_12' data-id='T12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. </span>
<span class='v T12_13' data-id='T12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For Adam was formed first, then Eve; </span>
<span class='v T12_14' data-id='T12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. </span>
<span class='v T12_15' data-id='T12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yet she will be saved through childbearing—if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control. </span></div></div>
