<div class='s'>The Authority of Jesus Challenged </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_1' data-id='LK20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> One day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes with the elders came up </span>
<span class='v LK20_2' data-id='LK20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “Tell us by what authority you do these things, or who it is that gave you this authority.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_3' data-id='LK20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He answered them, “I also will ask you a question. Now tell me, </span>
<span class='v LK20_4' data-id='LK20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man?” </span>
<span class='v LK20_5' data-id='LK20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v LK20_6' data-id='LK20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if we say, ‘From man,’ all the people will stone us to death, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_7' data-id='LK20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So they answered that they did not know where it came from. </span>
<span class='v LK20_8' data-id='LK20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Wicked Tenants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_9' data-id='LK20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> And he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard and let it out to tenants and went into another country for a long while. </span>
<span class='v LK20_10' data-id='LK20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When the time came, he sent a servant to the tenants, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. </span>
<span class='v LK20_11' data-id='LK20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he sent another servant. But they also beat and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed. </span>
<span class='v LK20_12' data-id='LK20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he sent yet a third. This one also they wounded and cast out. </span>
<span class='v LK20_13' data-id='LK20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’ </span>
<span class='v LK20_14' data-id='LK20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But when the tenants saw him, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’ </span>
<span class='v LK20_15' data-id='LK20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? </span>
<span class='v LK20_16' data-id='LK20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When they heard this, they said, “Surely not!” </span>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But he looked directly at them and said, “What then is this that is written: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'>“ ‘The stone that the builders rejected </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK20_17' data-id='LK20_17'>has become the cornerstone’? </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK20_18' data-id='LK20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paying Taxes to Caesar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_19' data-id='LK20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him at that very hour, for they perceived that he had told this parable against them, but they feared the people. </span>
<span class='v LK20_20' data-id='LK20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> So they watched him and sent spies, who pretended to be sincere, that they might catch him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. </span>
<span class='v LK20_21' data-id='LK20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and show no partiality, but truly teach the way of God. </span>
<span class='v LK20_22' data-id='LK20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?” </span>
<span class='v LK20_23' data-id='LK20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, </span>
<span class='v LK20_24' data-id='LK20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Show me a denarius. Whose likeness and inscription does it have?” They said, “Caesar's.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_25' data-id='LK20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_26' data-id='LK20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And they were not able in the presence of the people to catch him in what he said, but marveling at his answer they became silent. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_27' data-id='LK20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>There came to him some Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, </span>
<span class='v LK20_28' data-id='LK20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and they asked him a question, saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife but no children, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. </span>
<span class='v LK20_29' data-id='LK20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died without children. </span>
<span class='v LK20_30' data-id='LK20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the second </span>
<span class='v LK20_31' data-id='LK20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>and the third took her, and likewise all seven left no children and died. </span>
<span class='v LK20_32' data-id='LK20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Afterward the woman also died. </span>
<span class='v LK20_33' data-id='LK20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For the seven had her as wife.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_34' data-id='LK20_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage, </span>
<span class='v LK20_35' data-id='LK20_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage, </span>
<span class='v LK20_36' data-id='LK20_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>for they cannot die anymore, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection. </span>
<span class='v LK20_37' data-id='LK20_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed, in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. </span>
<span class='v LK20_38' data-id='LK20_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_39' data-id='LK20_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.” </span>
<span class='v LK20_40' data-id='LK20_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>For they no longer dared to ask him any question. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Whose Son Is the Christ? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_41' data-id='LK20_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> But he said to them, “How can they say that the Christ is David's son? </span>
<span class='v LK20_42' data-id='LK20_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For David himself says in the Book of Psalms, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK20_42' data-id='LK20_42'>“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK20_42' data-id='LK20_42'>Sit at my right hand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK20_43' data-id='LK20_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>until I make your enemies your footstool.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK20_44' data-id='LK20_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>David thus calls him Lord, so how is he his son?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Beware of the Scribes </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK20_45' data-id='LK20_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> And in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples, </span>
<span class='v LK20_46' data-id='LK20_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, </span>
<span class='v LK20_47' data-id='LK20_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.” </span></div></div>
