<div class='s'>The Birth of Jesus Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_1' data-id='LK2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. </span>
<span class='v LK2_2' data-id='LK2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>This was the first registration when Quirinius was governor of Syria. </span>
<span class='v LK2_3' data-id='LK2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And all went to be registered, each to his own town. </span>
<span class='v LK2_4' data-id='LK2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, </span>
<span class='v LK2_5' data-id='LK2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. </span>
<span class='v LK2_6' data-id='LK2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. </span>
<span class='v LK2_7' data-id='LK2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Shepherds and the Angels </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_8' data-id='LK2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. </span>
<span class='v LK2_9' data-id='LK2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. </span>
<span class='v LK2_10' data-id='LK2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of a great joy that will be for all the people. </span>
<span class='v LK2_11' data-id='LK2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK2_12' data-id='LK2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_13' data-id='LK2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Glory to God in the highest, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_14' data-id='LK2_14'>and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_15' data-id='LK2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_16' data-id='LK2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. </span>
<span class='v LK2_17' data-id='LK2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. </span>
<span class='v LK2_18' data-id='LK2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. </span>
<span class='v LK2_19' data-id='LK2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. </span>
<span class='v LK2_20' data-id='LK2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_21' data-id='LK2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Presented at the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_22' data-id='LK2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And when the time came for their purification according to the Law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord </span>
<span class='v LK2_23' data-id='LK2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every male who first opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord”) </span>
<span class='v LK2_24' data-id='LK2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_25' data-id='LK2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_26' data-id='LK2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. </span>
<span class='v LK2_27' data-id='LK2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, </span>
<span class='v LK2_28' data-id='LK2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_29' data-id='LK2_29'>according to your word; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_30' data-id='LK2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>for my eyes have seen your salvation </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_31' data-id='LK2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>a light for revelation to the Gentiles, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK2_32' data-id='LK2_32'>and for glory to your people Israel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_33' data-id='LK2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_34' data-id='LK2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed </span>
<span class='v LK2_35' data-id='LK2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_36' data-id='LK2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, </span>
<span class='v LK2_37' data-id='LK2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. </span>
<span class='v LK2_38' data-id='LK2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Return to Nazareth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_39' data-id='LK2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. </span>
<span class='v LK2_40' data-id='LK2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Boy Jesus in the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_41' data-id='LK2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover. </span>
<span class='v LK2_42' data-id='LK2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. </span>
<span class='v LK2_43' data-id='LK2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And when the feast was ended, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, </span>
<span class='v LK2_44' data-id='LK2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>but supposing him to be in the group they went a day's journey, but then they began to search for him among their relatives and acquaintances, </span>
<span class='v LK2_45' data-id='LK2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him. </span>
<span class='v LK2_46' data-id='LK2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. </span>
<span class='v LK2_47' data-id='LK2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers. </span>
<span class='v LK2_48' data-id='LK2_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And when his parents saw him, they were astonished. And his mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been searching for you in great distress.” </span>
<span class='v LK2_49' data-id='LK2_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?” </span>
<span class='v LK2_50' data-id='LK2_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And they did not understand the saying that he spoke to them. </span>
<span class='v LK2_51' data-id='LK2_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was submissive to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her heart. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK2_52' data-id='LK2_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man. </span></div></div>
