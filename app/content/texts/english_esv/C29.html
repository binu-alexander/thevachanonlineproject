<span class='v C29_1' data-id='C29_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints, </span>
<span class='v C29_2' data-id='C29_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them. </span>
<span class='v C29_3' data-id='C29_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove vain in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be. </span>
<span class='v C29_4' data-id='C29_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated—to say nothing of you—for being so confident. </span>
<span class='v C29_5' data-id='C29_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction. </span></div>

<span class='v C29_6' data-id='C29_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. </span>
<span class='v C29_7' data-id='C29_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Each one must give as he has made up his mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. </span>
<span class='v C29_8' data-id='C29_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work. </span>

<span class='v C29_10' data-id='C29_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. </span>
<span class='v C29_11' data-id='C29_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You will be enriched in every way for all your generosity, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. </span>
<span class='v C29_12' data-id='C29_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God. </span>
<span class='v C29_13' data-id='C29_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others, </span>
<span class='v C29_14' data-id='C29_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you. </span>
