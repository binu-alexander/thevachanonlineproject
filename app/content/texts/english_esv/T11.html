<span class='v T11_3' data-id='T11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine, </span>
<span class='v T11_4' data-id='T11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith. </span>
<span class='v T11_5' data-id='T11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith. </span>
<span class='v T11_6' data-id='T11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion, </span>
<span class='v T11_7' data-id='T11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T11_8' data-id='T11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully, </span>
<span class='v T11_9' data-id='T11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers, </span>
<span class='v T11_10' data-id='T11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine, </span>

<span class='v T11_13' data-id='T11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, </span>
<span class='v T11_14' data-id='T11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T11_15' data-id='T11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. </span>
<span class='v T11_16' data-id='T11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life. </span>
<span class='v T11_17' data-id='T11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
