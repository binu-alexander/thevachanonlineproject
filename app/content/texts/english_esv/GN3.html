<div class='s'>The Fall </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_1' data-id='GN3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the serpent was more crafty than any other beast of the field that the LORD God had made. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_1' data-id='GN3_1'>He said to the woman, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” </span>
<span class='v GN3_2' data-id='GN3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden, </span>
<span class='v GN3_3' data-id='GN3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” </span>
<span class='v GN3_4' data-id='GN3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. </span>
<span class='v GN3_5' data-id='GN3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” </span>
<span class='v GN3_6' data-id='GN3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate, and she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate. </span>
<span class='v GN3_7' data-id='GN3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loincloths. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_8' data-id='GN3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. </span>
<span class='v GN3_9' data-id='GN3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the LORD God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” </span>
<span class='v GN3_10' data-id='GN3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.” </span>
<span class='v GN3_11' data-id='GN3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” </span>
<span class='v GN3_12' data-id='GN3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate.” </span>
<span class='v GN3_13' data-id='GN3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The LORD God said to the serpent, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>“Because you have done this, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>cursed are you above all livestock </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>and above all beasts of the field; </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>on your belly you shall go, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>and dust you shall eat </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_14' data-id='GN3_14'>all the days of your life. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_15' data-id='GN3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>I will put enmity between you and the woman, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_15' data-id='GN3_15'>and between your offspring and her offspring; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_15' data-id='GN3_15'>he shall bruise your head, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_15' data-id='GN3_15'>and you shall bruise his heel.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>To the woman he said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'>“I will surely multiply your pain in childbearing; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'>in pain you shall bring forth children. </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'>Your desire shall be for your husband, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_16' data-id='GN3_16'>and he shall rule over you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And to Adam he said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'>“Because you have listened to the voice of your wife </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'>and have eaten of the tree </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'>of which I commanded you, </span></div>

<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'>cursed is the ground because of you; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_17' data-id='GN3_17'>in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_18' data-id='GN3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_18' data-id='GN3_18'>and you shall eat the plants of the field. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>By the sweat of your face </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'>you shall eat bread, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'>till you return to the ground, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'>for out of it you were taken; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'>for you are dust, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN3_19' data-id='GN3_19'>and to dust you shall return.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_20' data-id='GN3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. </span>
<span class='v GN3_21' data-id='GN3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN3_22' data-id='GN3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever—” </span>
<span class='v GN3_23' data-id='GN3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken. </span>
<span class='v GN3_24' data-id='GN3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He drove out the man, and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every way to guard the way to the tree of life. </span></div></div>
