<div class='s'>Healing of a Man on the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_1' data-id='LK14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>One Sabbath, when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were watching him carefully. </span>
<span class='v LK14_2' data-id='LK14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy. </span>
<span class='v LK14_3' data-id='LK14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jesus responded to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?” </span>
<span class='v LK14_4' data-id='LK14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away. </span>
<span class='v LK14_5' data-id='LK14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?” </span>
<span class='v LK14_6' data-id='LK14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they could not reply to these things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Wedding Feast </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_7' data-id='LK14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed how they chose the places of honor, saying to them, </span>
<span class='v LK14_8' data-id='LK14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him, </span>
<span class='v LK14_9' data-id='LK14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this person,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place. </span>
<span class='v LK14_10' data-id='LK14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. </span>
<span class='v LK14_11' data-id='LK14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Great Banquet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_12' data-id='LK14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He said also to the man who had invited him, “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid. </span>
<span class='v LK14_13' data-id='LK14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, </span>
<span class='v LK14_14' data-id='LK14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_15' data-id='LK14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!” </span>
<span class='v LK14_16' data-id='LK14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But he said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet and invited many. </span>
<span class='v LK14_17' data-id='LK14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And at the time for the banquet he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_18' data-id='LK14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_19' data-id='LK14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_20' data-id='LK14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And another said, ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_21' data-id='LK14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_22' data-id='LK14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the servant said, ‘Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_23' data-id='LK14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled. </span>
<span class='v LK14_24' data-id='LK14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Cost of Discipleship </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_25' data-id='LK14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them, </span>
<span class='v LK14_26' data-id='LK14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. </span>
<span class='v LK14_27' data-id='LK14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple. </span>
<span class='v LK14_28' data-id='LK14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it? </span>
<span class='v LK14_29' data-id='LK14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, </span>
<span class='v LK14_30' data-id='LK14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’ </span>
<span class='v LK14_31' data-id='LK14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? </span>
<span class='v LK14_32' data-id='LK14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace. </span>
<span class='v LK14_33' data-id='LK14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Salt Without Taste Is Worthless </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK14_34' data-id='LK14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“Salt is good, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? </span>
<span class='v LK14_35' data-id='LK14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.” </span></div></div>
