<div class='s'>The Parable of the Sower </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_1' data-id='MT13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. </span>
<span class='v MT13_2' data-id='MT13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. </span>
<span class='v MT13_3' data-id='MT13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he told them many things in parables, saying: “A sower went out to sow. </span>
<span class='v MT13_4' data-id='MT13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. </span>
<span class='v MT13_5' data-id='MT13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, </span>
<span class='v MT13_6' data-id='MT13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. </span>
<span class='v MT13_7' data-id='MT13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. </span>
<span class='v MT13_8' data-id='MT13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. </span>
<span class='v MT13_9' data-id='MT13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He who has ears, let him hear.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Purpose of the Parables </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_10' data-id='MT13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” </span>
<span class='v MT13_11' data-id='MT13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he answered them, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. </span>
<span class='v MT13_12' data-id='MT13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. </span>
<span class='v MT13_13' data-id='MT13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. </span>
<span class='v MT13_14' data-id='MT13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT13_14' data-id='MT13_14'>“ ‘You will indeed hear but never understand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_14' data-id='MT13_14'>and you will indeed see but never perceive. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this people's heart has grown dull, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>and with their ears they can barely hear, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>and their eyes they have closed, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>lest they should see with their eyes </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>and hear with their ears </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>and understand with their heart </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_15' data-id='MT13_15'>and turn, and I would heal them.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT13_16' data-id='MT13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. </span>
<span class='v MT13_17' data-id='MT13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Sower Explained </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_18' data-id='MT13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> “Hear then the parable of the sower: </span>
<span class='v MT13_19' data-id='MT13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. </span>
<span class='v MT13_20' data-id='MT13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, </span>
<span class='v MT13_21' data-id='MT13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. </span>
<span class='v MT13_22' data-id='MT13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. </span>
<span class='v MT13_23' data-id='MT13_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Weeds </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_24' data-id='MT13_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, </span>
<span class='v MT13_25' data-id='MT13_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. </span>
<span class='v MT13_26' data-id='MT13_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. </span>
<span class='v MT13_27' data-id='MT13_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’ </span>
<span class='v MT13_28' data-id='MT13_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ So the servants said to him, ‘Then do you want us to go and gather them?’ </span>
<span class='v MT13_29' data-id='MT13_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But he said, ‘No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. </span>
<span class='v MT13_30' data-id='MT13_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Mustard Seed and the Leaven </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_31' data-id='MT13_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He put another parable before them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. </span>
<span class='v MT13_32' data-id='MT13_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_33' data-id='MT13_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He told them another parable. “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Prophecy and Parables </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_34' data-id='MT13_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. </span>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'>“I will open my mouth in parables; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT13_35' data-id='MT13_35'>I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Weeds Explained </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_36' data-id='MT13_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.” </span>
<span class='v MT13_37' data-id='MT13_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v MT13_38' data-id='MT13_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>The field is the world, and the good seed is the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, </span>
<span class='v MT13_39' data-id='MT13_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. </span>
<span class='v MT13_40' data-id='MT13_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. </span>
<span class='v MT13_41' data-id='MT13_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, </span>
<span class='v MT13_42' data-id='MT13_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span>
<span class='v MT13_43' data-id='MT13_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Hidden Treasure </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_44' data-id='MT13_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Pearl of Great Value </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_45' data-id='MT13_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, </span>
<span class='v MT13_46' data-id='MT13_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Net </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_47' data-id='MT13_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. </span>
<span class='v MT13_48' data-id='MT13_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. </span>
<span class='v MT13_49' data-id='MT13_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous </span>
<span class='v MT13_50' data-id='MT13_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span></div>
<div class='s'>New and Old Treasures </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_51' data-id='MT13_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>“Have you understood all these things?” They said to him, “Yes.” </span>
<span class='v MT13_52' data-id='MT13_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT13_53' data-id='MT13_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, </span>
<span class='v MT13_54' data-id='MT13_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span> and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? </span>
<span class='v MT13_55' data-id='MT13_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? </span>
<span class='v MT13_56' data-id='MT13_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?” </span>
<span class='v MT13_57' data-id='MT13_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household.” </span>
<span class='v MT13_58' data-id='MT13_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. </span></div></div>
