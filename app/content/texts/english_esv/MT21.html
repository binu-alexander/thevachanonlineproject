<div class='s'>The Triumphal Entry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_1' data-id='MT21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, </span>
<span class='v MT21_2' data-id='MT21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>saying to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. </span>
<span class='v MT21_3' data-id='MT21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and he will send them at once.” </span>
<span class='v MT21_4' data-id='MT21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT21_5' data-id='MT21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span> “Say to the daughter of Zion, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT21_5' data-id='MT21_5'>‘Behold, your king is coming to you, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT21_5' data-id='MT21_5'>humble, and mounted on a donkey, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT21_5' data-id='MT21_5'>and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT21_6' data-id='MT21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. </span>
<span class='v MT21_7' data-id='MT21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. </span>
<span class='v MT21_8' data-id='MT21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. </span>
<span class='v MT21_9' data-id='MT21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!” </span>
<span class='v MT21_10' data-id='MT21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?” </span>
<span class='v MT21_11' data-id='MT21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the crowds said, “This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Cleanses the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_12' data-id='MT21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span> And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. </span>
<span class='v MT21_13' data-id='MT21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_14' data-id='MT21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. </span>
<span class='v MT21_15' data-id='MT21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant, </span>
<span class='v MT21_16' data-id='MT21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?” And Jesus said to them, “Yes; have you never read, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT21_16' data-id='MT21_16'>“ ‘Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT21_16' data-id='MT21_16'>you have prepared praise’?” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT21_17' data-id='MT21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Curses the Fig Tree </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_18' data-id='MT21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry. </span>
<span class='v MT21_19' data-id='MT21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, “May no fruit ever come from you again!” And the fig tree withered at once. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_20' data-id='MT21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?” </span>
<span class='v MT21_21' data-id='MT21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen. </span>
<span class='v MT21_22' data-id='MT21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Authority of Jesus Challenged </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_23' data-id='MT21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?” </span>
<span class='v MT21_24' data-id='MT21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, “I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
<span class='v MT21_25' data-id='MT21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?” And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v MT21_26' data-id='MT21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But if we say, ‘From man,’ we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet.” </span>
<span class='v MT21_27' data-id='MT21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Two Sons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_28' data-id='MT21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ </span>
<span class='v MT21_29' data-id='MT21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And he answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind and went. </span>
<span class='v MT21_30' data-id='MT21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go. </span>
<span class='v MT21_31' data-id='MT21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. </span>
<span class='v MT21_32' data-id='MT21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Tenants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_33' data-id='MT21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> “Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. </span>
<span class='v MT21_34' data-id='MT21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT21_35' data-id='MT21_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. </span>
<span class='v MT21_36' data-id='MT21_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. </span>
<span class='v MT21_37' data-id='MT21_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span>
<span class='v MT21_38' data-id='MT21_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’ </span>
<span class='v MT21_39' data-id='MT21_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </span>
<span class='v MT21_40' data-id='MT21_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?” </span>
<span class='v MT21_41' data-id='MT21_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_42' data-id='MT21_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT21_42' data-id='MT21_42'>“ ‘The stone that the builders rejected </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT21_42' data-id='MT21_42'>has become the cornerstone; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT21_42' data-id='MT21_42'>this was the Lord's doing, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT21_42' data-id='MT21_42'>and it is marvelous in our eyes’? </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT21_43' data-id='MT21_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. </span>
<span class='v MT21_44' data-id='MT21_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT21_45' data-id='MT21_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. </span>
<span class='v MT21_46' data-id='MT21_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet. </span></div></div>
