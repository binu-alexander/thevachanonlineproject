<div class='s'>Solomon's Accomplishments </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_1' data-id='R28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the LORD and his own house, </span>
<span class='v R28_2' data-id='R28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Solomon rebuilt the cities that Hiram had given to him, and settled the people of Israel in them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_3' data-id='R28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and took it. </span>
<span class='v R28_4' data-id='R28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities that he built in Hamath. </span>
<span class='v R28_5' data-id='R28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He also built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars, </span>
<span class='v R28_6' data-id='R28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the cities for his chariots and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. </span>
<span class='v R28_7' data-id='R28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>All the people who were left of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of Israel, </span>
<span class='v R28_8' data-id='R28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>from their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel had not destroyed—these Solomon drafted as forced labor, and so they are to this day. </span>
<span class='v R28_9' data-id='R28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves for his work; they were soldiers, and his officers, the commanders of his chariots, and his horsemen. </span>
<span class='v R28_10' data-id='R28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And these were the chief officers of King Solomon, 250, who exercised authority over the people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_11' data-id='R28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Solomon brought Pharaoh's daughter up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, for he said, “My wife shall not live in the house of David king of Israel, for the places to which the ark of the LORD has come are holy.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_12' data-id='R28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon offered up burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar of the LORD that he had built before the vestibule, </span>
<span class='v R28_13' data-id='R28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>as the duty of each day required, offering according to the commandment of Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, and the three annual feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths. </span>
<span class='v R28_14' data-id='R28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>According to the ruling of David his father, he appointed the divisions of the priests for their service, and the Levites for their offices of praise and ministry before the priests as the duty of each day required, and the gatekeepers in their divisions at each gate, for so David the man of God had commanded. </span>
<span class='v R28_15' data-id='R28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And they did not turn aside from what the king had commanded the priests and Levites concerning any matter and concerning the treasuries. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_16' data-id='R28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Thus was accomplished all the work of Solomon from the day the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid until it was finished. So the house of the LORD was completed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R28_17' data-id='R28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Eloth on the shore of the sea, in the land of Edom. </span>
<span class='v R28_18' data-id='R28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Hiram sent to him by the hand of his servants ships and servants familiar with the sea, and they went to Ophir together with the servants of Solomon and brought from there 450 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon. </span></div></div>
