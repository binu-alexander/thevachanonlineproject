<span class='v EK36_4' data-id='EK36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, the ravines and the valleys, the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which have become a prey and derision to the rest of the nations all around, </span>
<span class='v EK36_5' data-id='EK36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Surely I have spoken in my hot jealousy against the rest of the nations and against all Edom, who gave my land to themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and utter contempt, that they might make its pasturelands a prey. </span>
<span class='v EK36_6' data-id='EK36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered the reproach of the nations. </span>

<span class='v EK36_18' data-id='EK36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it. </span>
<span class='v EK36_19' data-id='EK36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them. </span>
<span class='v EK36_20' data-id='EK36_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.’ </span>
