<span class='v ER7_2' data-id='ER7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, </span>

<span class='v ER7_5' data-id='ER7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest— </span>
<span class='v ER7_6' data-id='ER7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>this Ezra went up from Babylonia. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses that the LORD the God of Israel had given, and the king granted him all that he asked, for the hand of the LORD his God was on him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER7_7' data-id='ER7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And there went up also to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king, some of the people of Israel, and some of the priests and Levites, the singers and gatekeepers, and the temple servants. </span>

<span class='v ER7_9' data-id='ER7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylonia, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was on him. </span>
<span class='v ER7_10' data-id='ER7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, and to do it and to teach his statutes and rules in Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER7_11' data-id='ER7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a man learned in matters of the commandments of the LORD and his statutes for Israel: </span>

<span class='v ER7_28' data-id='ER7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and who extended to me his steadfast love before the king and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty officers. I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was on me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me. </span></div></div>
