<div class='s'>Micah and the Levite </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_1' data-id='JG17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_2' data-id='JG17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son by the LORD.” </span>
<span class='v JG17_3' data-id='JG17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, “I dedicate the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you.” </span>
<span class='v JG17_4' data-id='JG17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_5' data-id='JG17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest. </span>
<span class='v JG17_6' data-id='JG17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG17_7' data-id='JG17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. </span>
<span class='v JG17_8' data-id='JG17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_9' data-id='JG17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place.” </span>
<span class='v JG17_10' data-id='JG17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Micah said to him, “Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.” And the Levite went in. </span>
<span class='v JG17_11' data-id='JG17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. </span>
<span class='v JG17_12' data-id='JG17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. </span>
<span class='v JG17_13' data-id='JG17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest.” </span></div></div>
