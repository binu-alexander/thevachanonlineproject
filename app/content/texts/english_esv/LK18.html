<div class='s'>The Parable of the Persistent Widow </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_1' data-id='LK18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he told them a parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose heart. </span>
<span class='v LK18_2' data-id='LK18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected man. </span>
<span class='v LK18_3' data-id='LK18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ </span>
<span class='v LK18_4' data-id='LK18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For a while he refused, but afterward he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect man, </span>
<span class='v LK18_5' data-id='LK18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will give her justice, so that she will not beat me down by her continual coming.’ ” </span>
<span class='v LK18_6' data-id='LK18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, “Hear what the unrighteous judge says. </span>
<span class='v LK18_7' data-id='LK18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And will not God give justice to his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he delay long over them? </span>
<span class='v LK18_8' data-id='LK18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I tell you, he will give justice to them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Pharisee and the Tax Collector </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_9' data-id='LK18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: </span>
<span class='v LK18_10' data-id='LK18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. </span>
<span class='v LK18_11' data-id='LK18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. </span>
<span class='v LK18_12' data-id='LK18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ </span>
<span class='v LK18_13' data-id='LK18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ </span>
<span class='v LK18_14' data-id='LK18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Let the Children Come to Me </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_15' data-id='LK18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> Now they were bringing even infants to him that he might touch them. And when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them. </span>
<span class='v LK18_16' data-id='LK18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus called them to him, saying, “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v LK18_17' data-id='LK18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Rich Ruler </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_18' data-id='LK18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> And a ruler asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” </span>
<span class='v LK18_19' data-id='LK18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. </span>
<span class='v LK18_20' data-id='LK18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.’ ” </span>
<span class='v LK18_21' data-id='LK18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he said, “All these I have kept from my youth.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_22' data-id='LK18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_23' data-id='LK18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But when he heard these things, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich. </span>
<span class='v LK18_24' data-id='LK18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Jesus, looking at him with sadness, said, “How difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! </span>
<span class='v LK18_25' data-id='LK18_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_26' data-id='LK18_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Those who heard it said, “Then who can be saved?” </span>
<span class='v LK18_27' data-id='LK18_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_28' data-id='LK18_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Peter said, “See, we have left our homes and followed you.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_29' data-id='LK18_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, </span>
<span class='v LK18_30' data-id='LK18_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_31' data-id='LK18_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> And taking the twelve, he said to them, “See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. </span>
<span class='v LK18_32' data-id='LK18_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For he will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and shamefully treated and spit upon. </span>
<span class='v LK18_33' data-id='LK18_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And after flogging him, they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_34' data-id='LK18_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But they understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what was said. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK18_35' data-id='LK18_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging. </span>
<span class='v LK18_36' data-id='LK18_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And hearing a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant. </span>
<span class='v LK18_37' data-id='LK18_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_38' data-id='LK18_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span>
<span class='v LK18_39' data-id='LK18_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And those who were in front rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” </span>
<span class='v LK18_40' data-id='LK18_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him, </span>
<span class='v LK18_41' data-id='LK18_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me recover my sight.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_42' data-id='LK18_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to him, “Recover your sight; your faith has made you well.” </span>
<span class='v LK18_43' data-id='LK18_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God. </span></div></div>
