<div class='s'>Jesus Delivered to Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_1' data-id='MK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v MK15_2' data-id='MK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_3' data-id='MK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests accused him of many things. </span>
<span class='v MK15_4' data-id='MK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_5' data-id='MK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_6' data-id='MK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. </span>
<span class='v MK15_7' data-id='MK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. </span>
<span class='v MK15_8' data-id='MK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. </span>
<span class='v MK15_9' data-id='MK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?” </span>
<span class='v MK15_10' data-id='MK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. </span>
<span class='v MK15_11' data-id='MK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. </span>
<span class='v MK15_12' data-id='MK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Pilate again said to them, “Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews?” </span>
<span class='v MK15_13' data-id='MK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And they cried out again, “Crucify him.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_14' data-id='MK15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_15' data-id='MK15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Mocked </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_16' data-id='MK15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. </span>
<span class='v MK15_17' data-id='MK15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_18' data-id='MK15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” </span>
<span class='v MK15_19' data-id='MK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_20' data-id='MK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_21' data-id='MK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. </span>
<span class='v MK15_22' data-id='MK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). </span>
<span class='v MK15_23' data-id='MK15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. </span>
<span class='v MK15_24' data-id='MK15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. </span>
<span class='v MK15_25' data-id='MK15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And it was the third hour when they crucified him. </span>
<span class='v MK15_26' data-id='MK15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_27' data-id='MK15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. </span>
<span class='v MK15_29' data-id='MK15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, </span>
<span class='v MK15_30' data-id='MK15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>save yourself, and come down from the cross!” </span>
<span class='v MK15_31' data-id='MK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself. </span>
<span class='v MK15_32' data-id='MK15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_33' data-id='MK15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. </span>
<span class='v MK15_34' data-id='MK15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” </span>
<span class='v MK15_35' data-id='MK15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_36' data-id='MK15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” </span>
<span class='v MK15_37' data-id='MK15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. </span>
<span class='v MK15_38' data-id='MK15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. </span>
<span class='v MK15_39' data-id='MK15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span> And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_40' data-id='MK15_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. </span>
<span class='v MK15_41' data-id='MK15_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK15_42' data-id='MK15_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, </span>
<span class='v MK15_43' data-id='MK15_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MK15_44' data-id='MK15_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. </span>
<span class='v MK15_45' data-id='MK15_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. </span>
<span class='v MK15_46' data-id='MK15_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MK15_47' data-id='MK15_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid. </span></div></div>
