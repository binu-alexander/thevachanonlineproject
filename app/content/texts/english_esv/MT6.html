<div class='s'>Giving to the Needy </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT6_1' data-id='MT6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT6_2' data-id='MT6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. </span>
<span class='v MT6_3' data-id='MT6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, </span>
<span class='v MT6_4' data-id='MT6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT6_5' data-id='MT6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites.

<span class='v MT6_6' data-id='MT6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. </span></div>

<span class='v MT6_7' data-id='MT6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. </span>
<span class='v MT6_8' data-id='MT6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. </span>

<span class='v MT6_19' data-id='MT6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, </span>

<span class='v MT6_23' data-id='MT6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! </span></div>

<span class='v MT6_24' data-id='MT6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Do Not Be Anxious </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT6_25' data-id='MT6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> “Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? </span>
<span class='v MT6_26' data-id='MT6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? </span>
<span class='v MT6_27' data-id='MT6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? </span>
<span class='v MT6_28' data-id='MT6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, </span>
<span class='v MT6_29' data-id='MT6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. </span>
<span class='v MT6_30' data-id='MT6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? </span>
<span class='v MT6_31' data-id='MT6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ </span>
<span class='v MT6_32' data-id='MT6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. </span>
<span class='v MT6_33' data-id='MT6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. </span></div>
