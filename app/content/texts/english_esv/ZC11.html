<span class='v ZC11_1' data-id='ZC11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Open your doors, O Lebanon, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_1' data-id='ZC11_1'>that the fire may devour your cedars! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>for the glorious trees are ruined! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>Wail, oaks of Bashan, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_2' data-id='ZC11_2'>for the thick forest has been felled! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The sound of the wail of the shepherds, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>for their glory is ruined! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>The sound of the roar of the lions, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_3' data-id='ZC11_3'>for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_4' data-id='ZC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Thus said the LORD my God: “Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_5' data-id='ZC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, ‘Blessed be the LORD, I have become rich,’ and their own shepherds have no pity on them. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_6' data-id='ZC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the LORD. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_7' data-id='ZC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named Favor, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_8' data-id='ZC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_9' data-id='ZC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So I said, “I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another.” </span>
<span class='v ZC11_10' data-id='ZC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_11' data-id='ZC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_12' data-id='ZC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then I said to them, “If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_13' data-id='ZC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Throw it to the potter”—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_14' data-id='ZC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC11_15' data-id='ZC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said to me, “Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd. </span>
<span class='v ZC11_16' data-id='ZC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Woe to my worthless shepherd, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>who deserts the flock! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>May the sword strike his arm </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>and his right eye! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>Let his arm be wholly withered, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v ZC11_17' data-id='ZC11_17'>his right eye utterly blinded!” </span></div></div>
