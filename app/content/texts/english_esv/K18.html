<div class='s'>The Ark Brought into the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_1' data-id='K18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. </span>
<span class='v K18_2' data-id='K18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. </span>
<span class='v K18_3' data-id='K18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. </span>
<span class='v K18_4' data-id='K18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up. </span>
<span class='v K18_5' data-id='K18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. </span>
<span class='v K18_6' data-id='K18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. </span>
<span class='v K18_7' data-id='K18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. </span>
<span class='v K18_8' data-id='K18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day. </span>
<span class='v K18_9' data-id='K18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v K18_10' data-id='K18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the LORD, </span>
<span class='v K18_11' data-id='K18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon Blesses the LORD </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_12' data-id='K18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon said, “The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness. </span>
<span class='v K18_13' data-id='K18_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever.” </span>
<span class='v K18_14' data-id='K18_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood. </span>
<span class='v K18_15' data-id='K18_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying, </span>
<span class='v K18_16' data-id='K18_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>‘Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel.’ </span>
<span class='v K18_17' data-id='K18_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K18_18' data-id='K18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But the LORD said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. </span>
<span class='v K18_19' data-id='K18_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.’ </span>
<span class='v K18_20' data-id='K18_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v K18_21' data-id='K18_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And there I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD that he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_22' data-id='K18_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven, </span>
<span class='v K18_23' data-id='K18_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and said, “O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart, </span>
<span class='v K18_24' data-id='K18_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>who have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day. </span>

<span class='v K18_26' data-id='K18_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David my father. </span></div>

<span class='v K18_27' data-id='K18_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built! </span>
<span class='v K18_28' data-id='K18_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O LORD my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day, </span>
<span class='v K18_29' data-id='K18_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, ‘My name shall be there,’ that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place. </span>

<span class='v K18_33' data-id='K18_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_54' data-id='K18_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven. </span>
<span class='v K18_55' data-id='K18_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_62' data-id='K18_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Then the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD. </span>
<span class='v K18_63' data-id='K18_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>Solomon offered as peace offerings to the LORD 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v K18_64' data-id='K18_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the LORD was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v K18_65' data-id='K18_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days. </span>
<span class='v K18_66' data-id='K18_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people. </span></div></div>
