<div class='s'>Traditions and Commandments </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_1' data-id='MT15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, </span>
<span class='v MT15_2' data-id='MT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_3' data-id='MT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He answered them, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? </span>
<span class='v MT15_4' data-id='MT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Who ever reviles father or mother must surely die.’ </span>
<span class='v MT15_5' data-id='MT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God, </span>
<span class='v MT15_6' data-id='MT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>he need not honor his father.’ So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. </span>
<span class='v MT15_7' data-id='MT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT15_8' data-id='MT15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> “ ‘This people honors me with their lips, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT15_8' data-id='MT15_8'>but their heart is far from me; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT15_9' data-id='MT15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>in vain do they worship me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT15_9' data-id='MT15_9'>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>What Defiles a Person </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_10' data-id='MT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he called the people to him and said to them, “Hear and understand: </span>
<span class='v MT15_11' data-id='MT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_12' data-id='MT15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?” </span>
<span class='v MT15_13' data-id='MT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. </span>
<span class='v MT15_14' data-id='MT15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_15' data-id='MT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_16' data-id='MT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Are you also still without understanding? </span>
<span class='v MT15_17' data-id='MT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? </span>
<span class='v MT15_18' data-id='MT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. </span>
<span class='v MT15_19' data-id='MT15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. </span>
<span class='v MT15_20' data-id='MT15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Faith of a Canaanite Woman </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_21' data-id='MT15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. </span>
<span class='v MT15_22' data-id='MT15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_23' data-id='MT15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_24' data-id='MT15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_25' data-id='MT15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_26' data-id='MT15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he answered, “It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_27' data-id='MT15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_28' data-id='MT15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus answered her, “O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed instantly. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_29' data-id='MT15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there. </span>
<span class='v MT15_30' data-id='MT15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, </span>
<span class='v MT15_31' data-id='MT15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Four Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT15_32' data-id='MT15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_33' data-id='MT15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And the disciples said to him, “Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd?” </span>
<span class='v MT15_34' data-id='MT15_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.” </span>
<span class='v MT15_35' data-id='MT15_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, </span>
<span class='v MT15_36' data-id='MT15_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. </span>
<span class='v MT15_37' data-id='MT15_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. </span>
<span class='v MT15_38' data-id='MT15_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. </span>
<span class='v MT15_39' data-id='MT15_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan. </span></div></div>
