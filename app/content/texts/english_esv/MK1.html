<span class='v MK1_4' data-id='MK1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. </span>
<span class='v MK1_5' data-id='MK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. </span>
<span class='v MK1_6' data-id='MK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. </span>
<span class='v MK1_7' data-id='MK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. </span>

<span class='v MK1_10' data-id='MK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opening and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. </span>
<span class='v MK1_11' data-id='MK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” </span></div>

<span class='v MK1_13' data-id='MK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Begins His Ministry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_14' data-id='MK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, </span>
<span class='v MK1_15' data-id='MK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.” </span></div>

<span class='v MK1_16' data-id='MK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. </span>
<span class='v MK1_17' data-id='MK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” </span>

<span class='v MK1_19' data-id='MK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. </span>
<span class='v MK1_20' data-id='MK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him. </span></div>

<span class='v MK1_22' data-id='MK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. </span>
<span class='v MK1_23' data-id='MK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, </span>
<span class='v MK1_24' data-id='MK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_25' data-id='MK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” </span>
<span class='v MK1_26' data-id='MK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. </span>
<span class='v MK1_27' data-id='MK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_28' data-id='MK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. </span></div>

<span class='v MK1_30' data-id='MK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. </span>
<span class='v MK1_31' data-id='MK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_32' data-id='MK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. </span>
<span class='v MK1_33' data-id='MK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And the whole city was gathered together at the door. </span>
<span class='v MK1_34' data-id='MK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Preaches in Galilee </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK1_35' data-id='MK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span> And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. </span>
<span class='v MK1_36' data-id='MK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, </span>
<span class='v MK1_37' data-id='MK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_38' data-id='MK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_39' data-id='MK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. </span></div>

<span class='v MK1_40' data-id='MK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, “If you will, you can make me clean.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_41' data-id='MK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, “I will; be clean.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_42' data-id='MK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. </span>
<span class='v MK1_43' data-id='MK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, </span>
<span class='v MK1_44' data-id='MK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” </span>
<span class='v MK1_45' data-id='MK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter. </span></div></div>
