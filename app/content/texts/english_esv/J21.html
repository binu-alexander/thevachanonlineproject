<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_1' data-id='J21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth, </span>
<span class='v J21_2' data-id='J21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_3' data-id='J21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Walking in Truth and Love </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J21_4' data-id='J21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father. </span>
<span class='v J21_5' data-id='J21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And now I ask you, dear lady—not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another. </span>
<span class='v J21_6' data-id='J21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it. </span>
<span class='v J21_7' data-id='J21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. </span>
<span class='v J21_8' data-id='J21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward. </span>
<span class='v J21_9' data-id='J21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. </span>
<span class='v J21_10' data-id='J21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting, </span>
<span class='v J21_11' data-id='J21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works. </span></div>

<span class='v J21_12' data-id='J21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete. </span></div>
