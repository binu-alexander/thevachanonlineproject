<span class='v DT21_2' data-id='DT21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>then your elders and your judges shall come out, and they shall measure the distance to the surrounding cities. </span>
<span class='v DT21_3' data-id='DT21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the elders of the city that is nearest to the slain man shall take a heifer that has never been worked and that has not pulled in a yoke. </span>
<span class='v DT21_4' data-id='DT21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. </span>
<span class='v DT21_5' data-id='DT21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister to him and to bless in the name of the LORD, and by their word every dispute and every assault shall be settled. </span>
<span class='v DT21_6' data-id='DT21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And all the el ders of that city nearest to the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley, </span>
<span class='v DT21_7' data-id='DT21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and they shall testify, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it shed. </span>
