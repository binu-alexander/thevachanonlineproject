<span class='v GN25_32' data-id='GN25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Esau said, “I am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” </span>
<span class='v GN25_33' data-id='GN25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Jacob said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. </span>
