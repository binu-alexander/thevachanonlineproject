<span class='v GN17_3' data-id='GN17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then Abram fell on his face. And God said to him, </span>
<span class='v GN17_4' data-id='GN17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Behold, my covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. </span>
<span class='v GN17_5' data-id='GN17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No longer shall your name be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations. </span>

<span class='v GN17_7' data-id='GN17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you. </span>
<span class='v GN17_8' data-id='GN17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God.” </span></div>
