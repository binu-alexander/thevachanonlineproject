<div class='p'>
<span class='v C113_1' data-id='C113_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. </span>
<span class='v C113_2' data-id='C113_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. </span>
<span class='v C113_3' data-id='C113_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C113_4' data-id='C113_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant </span>
<span class='v C113_5' data-id='C113_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; </span>
<span class='v C113_6' data-id='C113_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. </span>
<span class='v C113_7' data-id='C113_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C113_8' data-id='C113_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. </span>
<span class='v C113_9' data-id='C113_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For we know in part and we prophesy in part, </span>
<span class='v C113_10' data-id='C113_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. </span>
<span class='v C113_11' data-id='C113_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. </span>
<span class='v C113_12' data-id='C113_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C113_13' data-id='C113_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. </span></div></div>
