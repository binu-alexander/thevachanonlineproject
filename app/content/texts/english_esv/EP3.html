<div class='s'>The Mystery of the Gospel Revealed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_1' data-id='EP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles— </span>
<span class='v EP3_2' data-id='EP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, </span>
<span class='v EP3_3' data-id='EP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly. </span>
<span class='v EP3_4' data-id='EP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_5' data-id='EP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v EP3_6' data-id='EP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_7' data-id='EP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power. </span>
<span class='v EP3_8' data-id='EP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP3_9' data-id='EP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things, </span>
<span class='v EP3_10' data-id='EP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. </span>
<span class='v EP3_11' data-id='EP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, </span>
<span class='v EP3_12' data-id='EP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him. </span>
<span class='v EP3_13' data-id='EP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Prayer for Spiritual Strength </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_14' data-id='EP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, </span>
<span class='v EP3_15' data-id='EP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, </span>
<span class='v EP3_16' data-id='EP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, </span>
<span class='v EP3_17' data-id='EP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, </span>
<span class='v EP3_18' data-id='EP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, </span>
<span class='v EP3_19' data-id='EP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP3_20' data-id='EP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, </span>
<span class='v EP3_21' data-id='EP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen. </span></div></div>
