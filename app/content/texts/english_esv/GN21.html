<div class='s'>The Birth of Isaac </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN21_1' data-id='GN21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did to Sarah as he had promised. </span>
<span class='v GN21_2' data-id='GN21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the time of which God had spoken to him. </span>
<span class='v GN21_3' data-id='GN21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore him, Isaac. </span>
<span class='v GN21_4' data-id='GN21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. </span>
<span class='v GN21_5' data-id='GN21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him. </span>
<span class='v GN21_6' data-id='GN21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Sarah said, “God has made laughter for me; everyone who hears will laugh over me.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_7' data-id='GN21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>God Protects Hagar and Ishmael </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN21_8' data-id='GN21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. </span>
<span class='v GN21_9' data-id='GN21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, laughing. </span>
<span class='v GN21_10' data-id='GN21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman with her son, for the son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_11' data-id='GN21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. </span>
<span class='v GN21_12' data-id='GN21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. </span>
<span class='v GN21_13' data-id='GN21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_14' data-id='GN21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN21_15' data-id='GN21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>When the water in the skin was gone, she put the child under one of the bushes. </span>
<span class='v GN21_16' data-id='GN21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance of a bowshot, for she said, “Let me not look on the death of the child.” And as she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. </span>
<span class='v GN21_17' data-id='GN21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is. </span>
<span class='v GN21_18' data-id='GN21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Up! Lift up the boy, and hold him fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_19' data-id='GN21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. </span>
<span class='v GN21_20' data-id='GN21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And God was with the boy, and he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. </span>
<span class='v GN21_21' data-id='GN21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Treaty with Abimelech </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN21_22' data-id='GN21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do. </span>
<span class='v GN21_23' data-id='GN21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my descendants or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_24' data-id='GN21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Abraham said, “I will swear.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN21_25' data-id='GN21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When Abraham reproved Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized, </span>
<span class='v GN21_26' data-id='GN21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Abimelech said, “I do not know who has done this thing; you did not tell me, and I have not heard of it until today.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_27' data-id='GN21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant. </span>
<span class='v GN21_28' data-id='GN21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. </span>
<span class='v GN21_29' data-id='GN21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set apart?” </span>
<span class='v GN21_30' data-id='GN21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>He said, “These seven ewe lambs you will take from my hand, that this may be a witness for me that I dug this well.” </span>
<span class='v GN21_31' data-id='GN21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because there both of them swore an oath. </span>
<span class='v GN21_32' data-id='GN21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>So they made a covenant at Beersheba. Then Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army rose up and returned to the land of the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v GN21_33' data-id='GN21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God. </span>
<span class='v GN21_34' data-id='GN21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Abraham sojourned many days in the land of the Philistines. </span></div></div>
