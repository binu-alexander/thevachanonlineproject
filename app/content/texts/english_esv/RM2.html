<div class='s'>God's Righteous Judgment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_1' data-id='RM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_2' data-id='RM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who do such things. </span>
<span class='v RM2_3' data-id='RM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who do such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God? </span>
<span class='v RM2_4' data-id='RM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? </span>
<span class='v RM2_5' data-id='RM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_6' data-id='RM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He will render to each one according to his works: </span>
<span class='v RM2_7' data-id='RM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; </span>
<span class='v RM2_8' data-id='RM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury. </span>
<span class='v RM2_9' data-id='RM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, </span>
<span class='v RM2_10' data-id='RM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. </span>
<span class='v RM2_11' data-id='RM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For God shows no partiality. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God's Judgment and the Law </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_12' data-id='RM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_13' data-id='RM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. </span>
<span class='v RM2_14' data-id='RM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_15' data-id='RM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them </span>
<span class='v RM2_16' data-id='RM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_17' data-id='RM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God </span>
<span class='v RM2_18' data-id='RM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law; </span>
<span class='v RM2_19' data-id='RM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, </span>
<span class='v RM2_20' data-id='RM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth— </span>
<span class='v RM2_21' data-id='RM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal? </span>
<span class='v RM2_22' data-id='RM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? </span>
<span class='v RM2_23' data-id='RM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_24' data-id='RM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For, as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM2_25' data-id='RM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision. </span>
<span class='v RM2_26' data-id='RM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? </span>
<span class='v RM2_27' data-id='RM2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law. </span>
<span class='v RM2_28' data-id='RM2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical. </span>
<span class='v RM2_29' data-id='RM2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God. </span></div></div>
