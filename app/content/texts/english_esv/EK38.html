<span class='v EK38_2' data-id='EK38_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him </span>
<span class='v EK38_3' data-id='EK38_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. </span>
<span class='v EK38_4' data-id='EK38_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out, and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great host, all of them with buckler and shield, wielding swords. </span>
<span class='v EK38_5' data-id='EK38_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Persia, Cush, and Put are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; </span>

<span class='v EK38_8' data-id='EK38_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>After many days you will be mustered. In the latter years you will go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely, all of them. </span>
<span class='v EK38_9' data-id='EK38_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>You will advance, coming on like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes, and many peoples with you. </span></div>

<span class='v EK38_10' data-id='EK38_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day, thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme </span>
<span class='v EK38_11' data-id='EK38_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and say, ‘I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having no bars or gates,’ </span>
<span class='v EK38_12' data-id='EK38_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who were gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth. </span>
<span class='v EK38_13' data-id='EK38_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, ‘Have you come to seize spoil?

<span class='v EK38_14' data-id='EK38_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord GOD: On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know it? </span>
<span class='v EK38_15' data-id='EK38_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army. </span>
<span class='v EK38_16' data-id='EK38_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land.

<span class='v EK38_18' data-id='EK38_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But on that day, the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel, declares the Lord GOD, my wrath will be roused in my anger. </span>
<span class='v EK38_19' data-id='EK38_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare, On that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. </span>

<span class='v EK38_22' data-id='EK38_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>With pestilence and bloodshed I will enter into judgment with him, and I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur. </span>
<span class='v EK38_23' data-id='EK38_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am the LORD. </span></div></div>
