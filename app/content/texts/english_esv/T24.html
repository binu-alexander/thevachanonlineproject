<span class='v T24_1' data-id='T24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: </span>
<span class='v T24_2' data-id='T24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. </span>
<span class='v T24_3' data-id='T24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, </span>
<span class='v T24_4' data-id='T24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. </span>
<span class='v T24_5' data-id='T24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_6' data-id='T24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. </span>
<span class='v T24_7' data-id='T24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. </span>
<span class='v T24_8' data-id='T24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Personal Instructions </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T24_9' data-id='T24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do your best to come to me soon. </span>
<span class='v T24_10' data-id='T24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia. </span>
<span class='v T24_11' data-id='T24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry. </span>
<span class='v T24_12' data-id='T24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. </span>
<span class='v T24_13' data-id='T24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments. </span>
<span class='v T24_14' data-id='T24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. </span>
<span class='v T24_15' data-id='T24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message. </span>
<span class='v T24_16' data-id='T24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them! </span>
<span class='v T24_17' data-id='T24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth. </span>
<span class='v T24_18' data-id='T24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
