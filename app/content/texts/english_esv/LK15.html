<div class='s'>The Parable of the Lost Sheep </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_1' data-id='LK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him. </span>
<span class='v LK15_2' data-id='LK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, “This man receives sinners and eats with them.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_3' data-id='LK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So he told them this parable: </span>
<span class='v LK15_4' data-id='LK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? </span>
<span class='v LK15_5' data-id='LK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. </span>
<span class='v LK15_6' data-id='LK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_7' data-id='LK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Lost Coin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_8' data-id='LK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it? </span>
<span class='v LK15_9' data-id='LK15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_10' data-id='LK15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Just so, I tell you, there is joy before the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Prodigal Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_11' data-id='LK15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he said, “There was a man who had two sons. </span>
<span class='v LK15_12' data-id='LK15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of property that is coming to me.’ And he divided his property between them. </span>
<span class='v LK15_13' data-id='LK15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in reckless living. </span>
<span class='v LK15_14' data-id='LK15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need. </span>
<span class='v LK15_15' data-id='LK15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs. </span>
<span class='v LK15_16' data-id='LK15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he was longing to be fed with the pods that the pigs ate, and no one gave him anything. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_17' data-id='LK15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“But when he came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger! </span>
<span class='v LK15_18' data-id='LK15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. </span>
<span class='v LK15_19' data-id='LK15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Treat me as one of your hired servants.” ’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_20' data-id='LK15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and ran and embraced him and kissed him. </span>
<span class='v LK15_21' data-id='LK15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_22' data-id='LK15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. </span>
<span class='v LK15_23' data-id='LK15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. </span>
<span class='v LK15_24' data-id='LK15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK15_25' data-id='LK15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. </span>
<span class='v LK15_26' data-id='LK15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. </span>
<span class='v LK15_27' data-id='LK15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_28' data-id='LK15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him, </span>
<span class='v LK15_29' data-id='LK15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but he answered his father, ‘Look, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed your command, yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might celebrate with my friends. </span>
<span class='v LK15_30' data-id='LK15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with prostitutes, you killed the fattened calf for him!’ </span>
<span class='v LK15_31' data-id='LK15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, ‘Son, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. </span>
<span class='v LK15_32' data-id='LK15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>It was fitting to celebrate and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost, and is found.’ ” </span></div></div>
