<span class='v IS37_2' data-id='IS37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz. </span>
<span class='v IS37_3' data-id='IS37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. </span>
<span class='v IS37_4' data-id='IS37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>It may be that the LORD your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the LORD your God has heard; therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.’ ” </span></div>

<span class='v IS37_8' data-id='IS37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish. </span>
<span class='v IS37_9' data-id='IS37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Now the king heard concerning Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, </span>
<span class='v IS37_10' data-id='IS37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria. </span>
