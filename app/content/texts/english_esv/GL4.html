<div class='s'>Sons and Heirs </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_1' data-id='GL4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything, </span>
<span class='v GL4_2' data-id='GL4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. </span>
<span class='v GL4_3' data-id='GL4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. </span>
<span class='v GL4_4' data-id='GL4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, </span>
<span class='v GL4_5' data-id='GL4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. </span>
<span class='v GL4_6' data-id='GL4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba! Father!” </span>
<span class='v GL4_7' data-id='GL4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_8' data-id='GL4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. </span>
<span class='v GL4_9' data-id='GL4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? </span>
<span class='v GL4_10' data-id='GL4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You observe days and months and seasons and years! </span>
<span class='v GL4_11' data-id='GL4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_12' data-id='GL4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong. </span>
<span class='v GL4_13' data-id='GL4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first, </span>
<span class='v GL4_14' data-id='GL4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v GL4_15' data-id='GL4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What then has become of the blessing you felt? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me. </span>
<span class='v GL4_16' data-id='GL4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth? </span>
<span class='v GL4_17' data-id='GL4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them. </span>
<span class='v GL4_18' data-id='GL4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you, </span>
<span class='v GL4_19' data-id='GL4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you! </span>
<span class='v GL4_20' data-id='GL4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Example of Hagar and Sarah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL4_21' data-id='GL4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law? </span>
<span class='v GL4_22' data-id='GL4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman. </span>
<span class='v GL4_23' data-id='GL4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise. </span>
<span class='v GL4_24' data-id='GL4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. </span>
<span class='v GL4_25' data-id='GL4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. </span>
<span class='v GL4_26' data-id='GL4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. </span>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>“Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>For the children of the desolate one will be more </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GL4_27' data-id='GL4_27'>than those of the one who has a husband.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GL4_28' data-id='GL4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. </span>
<span class='v GL4_29' data-id='GL4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. </span>
<span class='v GL4_30' data-id='GL4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.” </span>
<span class='v GL4_31' data-id='GL4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman. </span></div></div>
