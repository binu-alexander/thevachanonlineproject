<div class='s'>Balaam's First Oracle </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_1' data-id='NU23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_2' data-id='NU23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Balak did as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam offered on each altar a bull and a ram. </span>
<span class='v NU23_3' data-id='NU23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height, </span>
<span class='v NU23_4' data-id='NU23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_5' data-id='NU23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_6' data-id='NU23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering. </span>
<span class='v NU23_7' data-id='NU23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Balaam took up his discourse and said, </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_7' data-id='NU23_7'>“From Aram Balak has brought me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_7' data-id='NU23_7'>the king of Moab from the eastern mountains: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_7' data-id='NU23_7'>‘Come, curse Jacob for me, </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_9' data-id='NU23_9'>and not counting itself among the nations! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_10' data-id='NU23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Who can count the dust of Jacob </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_10' data-id='NU23_10'>Let me die the death of the upright, </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_11' data-id='NU23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_12' data-id='NU23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he answered and said, “Must I not take care to speak what the LORD puts in my mouth?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Balaam's Second Oracle </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_13' data-id='NU23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_14' data-id='NU23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. </span>
<span class='v NU23_15' data-id='NU23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the LORD over there.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_16' data-id='NU23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the LORD met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_17' data-id='NU23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?” </span>
<span class='v NU23_18' data-id='NU23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Balaam took up his discourse and said, </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_18' data-id='NU23_18'>“Rise, Balak, and hear; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_18' data-id='NU23_18'>give ear to me, O son of Zippor: </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_19' data-id='NU23_19'>Has he said, and will he not do it? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_19' data-id='NU23_19'>Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it? </span></div>
<div class='q'>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_20' data-id='NU23_20'>he has blessed, and I cannot revoke it. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_21' data-id='NU23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_21' data-id='NU23_21'>The LORD their God is with them, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_21' data-id='NU23_21'>and the shout of a king is among them. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_22' data-id='NU23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>God brings them out of Egypt </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_22' data-id='NU23_22'>and is for them like the horns of the wild ox. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_23' data-id='NU23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For there is no enchantment against Jacob, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_23' data-id='NU23_23'>no divination against Israel; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_23' data-id='NU23_23'>now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel, </span></div>

<span class='v NU23_23' data-id='NU23_23'>‘What has God wrought!’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_24' data-id='NU23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Behold, a people! As a lioness it rises up </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_24' data-id='NU23_24'>and as a lion it lifts itself; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU23_24' data-id='NU23_24'>it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU23_24' data-id='NU23_24'>and drunk the blood of the slain.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU23_25' data-id='NU23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_26' data-id='NU23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell you, ‘All that the LORD says, that I must do’?” </span>
<span class='v NU23_27' data-id='NU23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_28' data-id='NU23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the desert. </span>
<span class='v NU23_29' data-id='NU23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.” </span>
<span class='v NU23_30' data-id='NU23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. </span></div></div>
