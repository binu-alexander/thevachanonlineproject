<div class='s'>The Death of John the Baptist </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_1' data-id='MT14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, </span>
<span class='v MT14_2' data-id='MT14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_3' data-id='MT14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, </span>
<span class='v MT14_4' data-id='MT14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>because John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_5' data-id='MT14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MT14_6' data-id='MT14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, </span>
<span class='v MT14_7' data-id='MT14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. </span>
<span class='v MT14_8' data-id='MT14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_9' data-id='MT14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. </span>
<span class='v MT14_10' data-id='MT14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, </span>
<span class='v MT14_11' data-id='MT14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MT14_12' data-id='MT14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_13' data-id='MT14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. </span>
<span class='v MT14_14' data-id='MT14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. </span>
<span class='v MT14_15' data-id='MT14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_16' data-id='MT14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_17' data-id='MT14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_18' data-id='MT14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Bring them here to me.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_19' data-id='MT14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. </span>
<span class='v MT14_20' data-id='MT14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. </span>
<span class='v MT14_21' data-id='MT14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Walks on the Water </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_22' data-id='MT14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. </span>
<span class='v MT14_23' data-id='MT14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, </span>
<span class='v MT14_24' data-id='MT14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. </span>
<span class='v MT14_25' data-id='MT14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. </span>
<span class='v MT14_26' data-id='MT14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear. </span>
<span class='v MT14_27' data-id='MT14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_28' data-id='MT14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And Peter answered him, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_29' data-id='MT14_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>He said, “Come.” So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT14_30' data-id='MT14_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.” </span>
<span class='v MT14_31' data-id='MT14_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, “O you of little faith, why did you doubt?” </span>
<span class='v MT14_32' data-id='MT14_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. </span>
<span class='v MT14_33' data-id='MT14_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT14_34' data-id='MT14_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. </span>
<span class='v MT14_35' data-id='MT14_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick </span>
<span class='v MT14_36' data-id='MT14_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well. </span></div></div>
