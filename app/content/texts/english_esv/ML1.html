<div class='s'>The LORD's Love for Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ML1_2' data-id='ML1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“I have loved you,” says the LORD. But you say, “How have you loved us?” “Is not Esau Jacob's brother?” declares the LORD. “Yet I have loved Jacob </span>
<span class='v ML1_3' data-id='ML1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but Esau I have hated. I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.” </span>
<span class='v ML1_4' data-id='ML1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If Edom says, “We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,” the LORD of hosts says, “They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called ‘the wicked country,’ and ‘the people with whom the LORD is angry forever.’ ” </span>
<span class='v ML1_5' data-id='ML1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, “Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!” </span></div>

<span class='v ML1_6' data-id='ML1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the LORD of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’ </span>
<span class='v ML1_7' data-id='ML1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying that the LORD's table may be despised. </span>
<span class='v ML1_8' data-id='ML1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ML1_9' data-id='ML1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, will he show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ML1_10' data-id='ML1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand. </span>
<span class='v ML1_11' data-id='ML1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the LORD of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ML1_12' data-id='ML1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But you profane it when you say that the Lord's table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised. </span>
<span class='v ML1_13' data-id='ML1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But you say, ‘What a weariness this is,’ and you snort at it, says the LORD of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the LORD. </span>
<span class='v ML1_14' data-id='ML1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts, and my name will be feared among the nations. </span></div></div>
