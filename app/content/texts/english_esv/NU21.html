<div class='s'>Arad Destroyed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_1' data-id='NU21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negeb, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. </span>
<span class='v NU21_2' data-id='NU21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD and said, “If you will indeed give this people into my hand, then I will devote their cities to destruction.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_3' data-id='NU21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the LORD obeyed the voice of Israel and gave over the Canaanites, and they devoted them and their cities to destruction. So the name of the place was called Hormah. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Bronze Serpent </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_4' data-id='NU21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>From Mount Hor they set out by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. And the people became impatient on the way. </span>
<span class='v NU21_5' data-id='NU21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and no water, and we loathe this worthless food.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_6' data-id='NU21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died. </span>
<span class='v NU21_7' data-id='NU21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you. Pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. </span>
<span class='v NU21_8' data-id='NU21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole, and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_9' data-id='NU21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent bit anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent and live. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Song of the Well </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_10' data-id='NU21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the people of Israel set out and camped in Oboth. </span>
<span class='v NU21_11' data-id='NU21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness that is opposite Moab, toward the sunrise. </span>
<span class='v NU21_12' data-id='NU21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>From there they set out and camped in the Valley of Zered. </span>
<span class='v NU21_13' data-id='NU21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the border of the Amorites, for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. </span>
<span class='v NU21_14' data-id='NU21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Wherefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_14' data-id='NU21_14'>“Waheb in Suphah, and the valleys of the Arnon, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_15' data-id='NU21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and the slope of the valleys </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_15' data-id='NU21_15'>that extends to the seat of Ar, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_15' data-id='NU21_15'>and leans to the border of Moab.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_16' data-id='NU21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And from there they continued to Beer; that is the well of which the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people together, so that I may give them water.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_17' data-id='NU21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sang this song: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_17' data-id='NU21_17'>“Spring up, O well!—Sing to it!— </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>the well that the princes dug, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>that the nobles of the people delved, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>with the scepter and with their staffs.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v NU21_18' data-id='NU21_18'>And from the wilderness they went on to Mattanah, </span>
<span class='v NU21_19' data-id='NU21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, </span>
<span class='v NU21_20' data-id='NU21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and from Bamoth to the valley lying in the region of Moab by the top of Pisgah that looks down on the desert. </span></div>
<div class='s'>King Sihon Defeated </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_21' data-id='NU21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, </span>
<span class='v NU21_22' data-id='NU21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the King's Highway until we have passed through your territory.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_23' data-id='NU21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his people together and went out against Israel to the wilderness and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel. </span>
<span class='v NU21_24' data-id='NU21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as to the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was strong. </span>
<span class='v NU21_25' data-id='NU21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. </span>
<span class='v NU21_26' data-id='NU21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. </span>
<span class='v NU21_27' data-id='NU21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Therefore the ballad singers say, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_27' data-id='NU21_27'>“Come to Heshbon, let it be built; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_27' data-id='NU21_27'>let the city of Sihon be established. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_28' data-id='NU21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>For fire came out from Heshbon, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_28' data-id='NU21_28'>flame from the city of Sihon. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_28' data-id='NU21_28'>It devoured Ar of Moab, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_28' data-id='NU21_28'>and swallowed the heights of the Arnon. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_29' data-id='NU21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Woe to you, O Moab! </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_29' data-id='NU21_29'>You are undone, O people of Chemosh! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_29' data-id='NU21_29'>He has made his sons fugitives, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_29' data-id='NU21_29'>and his daughters captives, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_29' data-id='NU21_29'>to an Amorite king, Sihon. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v NU21_30' data-id='NU21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So we overthrew them; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_30' data-id='NU21_30'>Heshbon, as far as Dibon, perished; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_30' data-id='NU21_30'>and we laid waste as far as Nophah; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v NU21_30' data-id='NU21_30'>fire spread as far as Medeba.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>King Og Defeated </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NU21_31' data-id='NU21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. </span>
<span class='v NU21_32' data-id='NU21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. </span>
<span class='v NU21_33' data-id='NU21_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then they turned and went up by the way to Bashan. And Og the king of Bashan came out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. </span>
<span class='v NU21_34' data-id='NU21_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have given him into your hand, and all his people, and his land. And you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” </span>
<span class='v NU21_35' data-id='NU21_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So they defeated him and his sons and all his people, until he had no survivor left. And they possessed his land. </span></div></div>
