<div class='s'>The LORD Has Drawn His Sword </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_1' data-id='EK21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> The word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK21_2' data-id='EK21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel </span>
<span class='v EK21_3' data-id='EK21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you and will draw my sword from its sheath and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked. </span>
<span class='v EK21_4' data-id='EK21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall be drawn from its sheath against all flesh from south to north. </span>
<span class='v EK21_5' data-id='EK21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And all flesh shall know that I am the LORD. I have drawn my sword from its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_6' data-id='EK21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“As for you, son of man, groan; with breaking heart and bitter grief, groan before their eyes. </span>
<span class='v EK21_7' data-id='EK21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when they say to you, ‘Why do you groan?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that it is coming. Every heart will melt, and all hands will be feeble; every spirit will faint, and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it is coming, and it will be fulfilled,’ ” declares the Lord GOD. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_8' data-id='EK21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK21_9' data-id='EK21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord; Say: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EK21_9' data-id='EK21_9'>“A sword, a sword is sharpened </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EK21_9' data-id='EK21_9'>and also polished, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EK21_10' data-id='EK21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>sharpened for slaughter, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EK21_10' data-id='EK21_10'>polished to flash like lightning! </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v EK21_10' data-id='EK21_10'>(Or shall we rejoice? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.) </span>
<span class='v EK21_11' data-id='EK21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be grasped in the hand. It is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer. </span>
<span class='v EK21_12' data-id='EK21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Cry out and wail, son of man, for it is against my people. It is against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered over to the sword with my people. Strike therefore upon your thigh. </span>
<span class='v EK21_13' data-id='EK21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For it will not be a testing—what could it do if you despise the rod?” declares the Lord GOD. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_14' data-id='EK21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“As for you, son of man, prophesy. Clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yes, three times, the sword for those to be slain. It is the sword for the great slaughter, which surrounds them, </span>
<span class='v EK21_15' data-id='EK21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>that their hearts may melt, and many stumble. At all their gates I have given the glittering sword. Ah, it is made like lightning; it is taken up for slaughter. </span>
<span class='v EK21_16' data-id='EK21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Cut sharply to the right; set yourself to the left, wherever your face is directed. </span>
<span class='v EK21_17' data-id='EK21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_18' data-id='EK21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD came to me again: </span>
<span class='v EK21_19' data-id='EK21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“As for you, son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come. Both of them shall come from the same land. And make a signpost; make it at the head of the way to a city. </span>
<span class='v EK21_20' data-id='EK21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah, into Jerusalem the fortified. </span>
<span class='v EK21_21' data-id='EK21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination. He shakes the arrows; he consults the teraphim; he looks at the liver. </span>
<span class='v EK21_22' data-id='EK21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Into his right hand comes the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth with murder, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers. </span>
<span class='v EK21_23' data-id='EK21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But to them it will seem like a false divination. They have sworn solemn oaths, but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be taken. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_24' data-id='EK21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your deeds your sins appear—because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in hand. </span>
<span class='v EK21_25' data-id='EK21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And you, O profane wicked one, prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of your final punishment, </span>
<span class='v EK21_26' data-id='EK21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>thus says the Lord GOD: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things shall not remain as they are. Exalt that which is low, and bring low that which is exalted. </span>
<span class='v EK21_27' data-id='EK21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>A ruin, ruin, ruin I will make it. This also shall not be, until he comes, the one to whom judgment belongs, and I will give it to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK21_28' data-id='EK21_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>“And you, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; say, A sword, a sword is drawn for the slaughter. It is polished to consume and to flash like lightning— </span>
<span class='v EK21_29' data-id='EK21_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies for you—to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of their final punishment. </span>
<span class='v EK21_30' data-id='EK21_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Return it to its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your origin, I will judge you. </span>
<span class='v EK21_31' data-id='EK21_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And I will pour out my indignation upon you; I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver you into the hands of brutish men, skillful to destroy. </span>
<span class='v EK21_32' data-id='EK21_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall be no more remembered, for I the LORD have spoken.” </span></div></div>
