<span class='v TT1_7' data-id='TT1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, </span>
<span class='v TT1_8' data-id='TT1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined. </span>
