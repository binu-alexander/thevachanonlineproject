<div class='s'>Teaching About Divorce </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_1' data-id='MT19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. </span>
<span class='v MT19_2' data-id='MT19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_3' data-id='MT19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, “Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_4' data-id='MT19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, </span>
<span class='v MT19_5' data-id='MT19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh’? </span>
<span class='v MT19_6' data-id='MT19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_7' data-id='MT19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_8' data-id='MT19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. </span>
<span class='v MT19_9' data-id='MT19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_10' data-id='MT19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, “If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_11' data-id='MT19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, “Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. </span>
<span class='v MT19_12' data-id='MT19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Let the Children Come to Me </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_13' data-id='MT19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, </span>
<span class='v MT19_14' data-id='MT19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>but Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_15' data-id='MT19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he laid his hands on them and went away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Rich Young Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_16' data-id='MT19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span> And behold, a man came up to him, saying, “Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_17' data-id='MT19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, “Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_18' data-id='MT19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, </span>
<span class='v MT19_19' data-id='MT19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_20' data-id='MT19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The young man said to him, “All these I have kept. What do I still lack?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_21' data-id='MT19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_22' data-id='MT19_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT19_23' data-id='MT19_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT19_24' data-id='MT19_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_25' data-id='MT19_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, “Who then can be saved?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_26' data-id='MT19_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” </span>
<span class='v MT19_27' data-id='MT19_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then Peter said in reply, “See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have?” </span>
<span class='v MT19_28' data-id='MT19_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT19_29' data-id='MT19_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. </span>
<span class='v MT19_30' data-id='MT19_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But many who are first will be last, and the last first. </span></div></div>
