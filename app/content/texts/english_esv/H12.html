<div class='s'>Paul's Ministry to the Thessalonians </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H12_1' data-id='H12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain. </span>
<span class='v H12_2' data-id='H12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict. </span>
<span class='v H12_3' data-id='H12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive, </span>
<span class='v H12_4' data-id='H12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts. </span>
<span class='v H12_5' data-id='H12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is witness. </span>
<span class='v H12_6' data-id='H12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ. </span>
<span class='v H12_7' data-id='H12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children. </span>
<span class='v H12_8' data-id='H12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H12_9' data-id='H12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God. </span>
<span class='v H12_10' data-id='H12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers. </span>
<span class='v H12_11' data-id='H12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For you know how, like a father with his children, </span>
<span class='v H12_12' data-id='H12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H12_13' data-id='H12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers. </span>
<span class='v H12_14' data-id='H12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews, </span>
<span class='v H12_15' data-id='H12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind </span>
<span class='v H12_16' data-id='H12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last! </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul's Longing to See Them Again </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H12_17' data-id='H12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face, </span>
<span class='v H12_18' data-id='H12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, again and again—but Satan hindered us. </span>
<span class='v H12_19' data-id='H12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? </span>
<span class='v H12_20' data-id='H12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For you are our glory and joy. </span></div></div>
