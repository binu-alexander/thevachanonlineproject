<div class='s'>Jesus Foretells Destruction of the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_1' data-id='MT24_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. </span>
<span class='v MT24_2' data-id='MT24_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, “You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Signs of the Close of the Age </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_3' data-id='MT24_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age?” </span>
<span class='v MT24_4' data-id='MT24_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. </span>
<span class='v MT24_5' data-id='MT24_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. </span>
<span class='v MT24_6' data-id='MT24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. </span>
<span class='v MT24_7' data-id='MT24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. </span>
<span class='v MT24_8' data-id='MT24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_9' data-id='MT24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. </span>
<span class='v MT24_10' data-id='MT24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. </span>
<span class='v MT24_11' data-id='MT24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. </span>
<span class='v MT24_12' data-id='MT24_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. </span>
<span class='v MT24_13' data-id='MT24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the one who endures to the end will be saved. </span>
<span class='v MT24_14' data-id='MT24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Abomination of Desolation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_15' data-id='MT24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), </span>
<span class='v MT24_16' data-id='MT24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. </span>
<span class='v MT24_17' data-id='MT24_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, </span>
<span class='v MT24_18' data-id='MT24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. </span>
<span class='v MT24_19' data-id='MT24_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! </span>
<span class='v MT24_20' data-id='MT24_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v MT24_21' data-id='MT24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. </span>
<span class='v MT24_22' data-id='MT24_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. </span>
<span class='v MT24_23' data-id='MT24_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. </span>
<span class='v MT24_24' data-id='MT24_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. </span>
<span class='v MT24_25' data-id='MT24_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>See, I have told you beforehand. </span>
<span class='v MT24_26' data-id='MT24_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. </span>
<span class='v MT24_27' data-id='MT24_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v MT24_28' data-id='MT24_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Coming of the Son of Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_29' data-id='MT24_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. </span>
<span class='v MT24_30' data-id='MT24_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. </span>
<span class='v MT24_31' data-id='MT24_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Lesson of the Fig Tree </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_32' data-id='MT24_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>“From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. </span>
<span class='v MT24_33' data-id='MT24_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. </span>
<span class='v MT24_34' data-id='MT24_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. </span>
<span class='v MT24_35' data-id='MT24_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>No One Knows That Day and Hour </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_36' data-id='MT24_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. </span>
<span class='v MT24_37' data-id='MT24_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v MT24_38' data-id='MT24_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, </span>
<span class='v MT24_39' data-id='MT24_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v MT24_40' data-id='MT24_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. </span>
<span class='v MT24_41' data-id='MT24_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. </span>
<span class='v MT24_42' data-id='MT24_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. </span>
<span class='v MT24_43' data-id='MT24_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. </span>
<span class='v MT24_44' data-id='MT24_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT24_45' data-id='MT24_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? </span>
<span class='v MT24_46' data-id='MT24_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. </span>
<span class='v MT24_47' data-id='MT24_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. </span>
<span class='v MT24_48' data-id='MT24_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’ </span>
<span class='v MT24_49' data-id='MT24_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, </span>
<span class='v MT24_50' data-id='MT24_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know </span>
<span class='v MT24_51' data-id='MT24_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. </span></div></div>
