<div class='c'>9</div>
<div class='s'>God's Sovereign Choice </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_1' data-id='RM9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I am speaking the truth in Christ—I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit— </span>
<span class='v RM9_2' data-id='RM9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. </span>
<span class='v RM9_3' data-id='RM9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh. </span>
<span class='v RM9_4' data-id='RM9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises. </span>
<span class='v RM9_5' data-id='RM9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_6' data-id='RM9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, </span>
<span class='v RM9_7' data-id='RM9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_8' data-id='RM9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring. </span>
<span class='v RM9_9' data-id='RM9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return and Sarah shall have a son.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_10' data-id='RM9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, </span>
<span class='v RM9_11' data-id='RM9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of his call— </span>
<span class='v RM9_12' data-id='RM9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_13' data-id='RM9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_14' data-id='RM9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means! </span>
<span class='v RM9_15' data-id='RM9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_16' data-id='RM9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy. </span>
<span class='v RM9_17' data-id='RM9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_18' data-id='RM9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_19' data-id='RM9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” </span>
<span class='v RM9_20' data-id='RM9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?” </span>
<span class='v RM9_21' data-id='RM9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honored use and another for dishonorable use? </span>
<span class='v RM9_22' data-id='RM9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, </span>
<span class='v RM9_23' data-id='RM9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory— </span>
<span class='v RM9_24' data-id='RM9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles? </span>
<span class='v RM9_25' data-id='RM9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>As indeed he says in Hosea, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM9_25' data-id='RM9_25'>“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM9_25' data-id='RM9_25'>and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM9_26' data-id='RM9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span> “And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM9_26' data-id='RM9_26'>there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_27' data-id='RM9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved, </span>
<span class='v RM9_28' data-id='RM9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.” </span>
<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And as Isaiah predicted, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'>“If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'>we would have been like Sodom </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM9_29' data-id='RM9_29'>and become like Gomorrah.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Israel's Unbelief </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM9_30' data-id='RM9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith; </span>
<span class='v RM9_31' data-id='RM9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law. </span>
<span class='v RM9_32' data-id='RM9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, </span>
<span class='v RM9_33' data-id='RM9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM9_33' data-id='RM9_33'>“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM9_33' data-id='RM9_33'>and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.” </span></div></div>
