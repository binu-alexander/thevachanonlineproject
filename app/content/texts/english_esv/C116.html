<div class='s'>The Collection for the Saints </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_1' data-id='C116_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do. </span>
<span class='v C116_2' data-id='C116_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come. </span>
<span class='v C116_3' data-id='C116_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v C116_4' data-id='C116_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Plans for Travel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_5' data-id='C116_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia, </span>
<span class='v C116_6' data-id='C116_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go. </span>
<span class='v C116_7' data-id='C116_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. </span>
<span class='v C116_8' data-id='C116_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, </span>
<span class='v C116_9' data-id='C116_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_10' data-id='C116_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am. </span>
<span class='v C116_11' data-id='C116_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Instructions </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_12' data-id='C116_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_13' data-id='C116_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. </span>
<span class='v C116_14' data-id='C116_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Let all that you do be done in love. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_15' data-id='C116_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now I urge you, brothers —you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints— </span>
<span class='v C116_16' data-id='C116_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. </span>
<span class='v C116_17' data-id='C116_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence, </span>
<span class='v C116_18' data-id='C116_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Greetings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_19' data-id='C116_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C116_20' data-id='C116_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C116_21' data-id='C116_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. </span>
<span class='v C116_22' data-id='C116_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come! </span>
<span class='v C116_23' data-id='C116_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. </span>
<span class='v C116_24' data-id='C116_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. </span></div></div>
