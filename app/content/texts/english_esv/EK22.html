<span class='v EK22_1' data-id='EK22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v EK22_2' data-id='EK22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then declare to her all her abominations. </span>
<span class='v EK22_3' data-id='EK22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in her midst, so that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself! </span>
<span class='v EK22_4' data-id='EK22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You have become guilty by the blood that you have shed, and defiled by the idols that you have made, and you have brought your days near, the appointed time of your years has come. Therefore I have made you a reproach to the nations, and a mockery to all the countries. </span>
<span class='v EK22_5' data-id='EK22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you; your name is defiled; you are full of tumult. </span></div>

<span class='v EK22_6' data-id='EK22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood. </span>
<span class='v EK22_7' data-id='EK22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you. </span>
<span class='v EK22_8' data-id='EK22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths. </span>
<span class='v EK22_9' data-id='EK22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and people in you who eat on the mountains; they commit lewdness in your midst. </span>
<span class='v EK22_10' data-id='EK22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In you men uncover their fathers' nakedness; in you they violate women who are unclean in their menstrual impurity. </span>
<span class='v EK22_11' data-id='EK22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>One commits abomination with his neighbor's wife; another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law; another in you violates his sister, his father's daughter. </span>
<span class='v EK22_12' data-id='EK22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In you they take bribes to shed blood; you take interest and profit and make gain of your neighbors by extortion; but me you have forgotten, declares the Lord GOD. </span></div>

<span class='v EK22_21' data-id='EK22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it. </span>
<span class='v EK22_22' data-id='EK22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>As silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it, and you shall know that I am the LORD; I have poured out my wrath upon you.” </span></div>

<span class='v EK22_25' data-id='EK22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The conspiracy of her prophets in her midst is like a roaring lion tearing the prey; they have devoured human lives; they have taken treasure and precious things; they have made many widows in her midst. </span>
<span class='v EK22_26' data-id='EK22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Her priests have done violence to my law and have profaned my holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them. </span>
<span class='v EK22_27' data-id='EK22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Her princes in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood, destroying lives to get dishonest gain. </span>
<span class='v EK22_28' data-id='EK22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And her prophets have smeared whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD,’ when the LORD has not spoken. </span>
<span class='v EK22_29' data-id='EK22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery. They have oppressed the poor and needy, and have extorted from the sojourner without justice. </span>
<span class='v EK22_30' data-id='EK22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And I sought for a man among them who should build up the wall and stand in the breach before me for the land, that I should not destroy it, but I found none. </span>
<span class='v EK22_31' data-id='EK22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Therefore I have poured out my indignation upon them. I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath. I have returned their way upon their heads, declares the Lord GOD.” </span></div></div>
