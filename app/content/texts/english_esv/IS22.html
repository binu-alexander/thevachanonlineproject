<span class='v IS22_5' data-id='IS22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For the Lord GOD of hosts has a day </span></div>

<span class='v IS22_6' data-id='IS22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Elam bore the quiver </span></div>

<span class='v IS22_10' data-id='IS22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall. </span>
<span class='v IS22_11' data-id='IS22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>You made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago. </span></div>

<span class='v IS22_19' data-id='IS22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station. </span>
<span class='v IS22_20' data-id='IS22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>In that day I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, </span>
<span class='v IS22_21' data-id='IS22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. </span>
<span class='v IS22_22' data-id='IS22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. </span>
<span class='v IS22_23' data-id='IS22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And I will fasten him like a peg in a secure place, and he will become a throne of honor to his father's house. </span>
