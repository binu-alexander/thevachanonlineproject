<div class='s'>Jesus and the Woman of Samaria </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_1' data-id='JN4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John </span>
<span class='v JN4_2' data-id='JN4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples), </span>
<span class='v JN4_3' data-id='JN4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>he left Judea and departed again for Galilee. </span>
<span class='v JN4_4' data-id='JN4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he had to pass through Samaria. </span>
<span class='v JN4_5' data-id='JN4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. </span>
<span class='v JN4_6' data-id='JN4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jacob's well was there; so Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_7' data-id='JN4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_8' data-id='JN4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>(For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.) </span>
<span class='v JN4_9' data-id='JN4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.) </span>
<span class='v JN4_10' data-id='JN4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered her, “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_11' data-id='JN4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water? </span>
<span class='v JN4_12' data-id='JN4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Are you greater than our father Jacob? He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_13' data-id='JN4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, </span>
<span class='v JN4_14' data-id='JN4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty forever. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_15' data-id='JN4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_16' data-id='JN4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_17' data-id='JN4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; </span>
<span class='v JN4_18' data-id='JN4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_19' data-id='JN4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet. </span>
<span class='v JN4_20' data-id='JN4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where people ought to worship.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_21' data-id='JN4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. </span>
<span class='v JN4_22' data-id='JN4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. </span>
<span class='v JN4_23' data-id='JN4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. </span>
<span class='v JN4_24' data-id='JN4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_25' data-id='JN4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, he will tell us all things.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_26' data-id='JN4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am he.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_27' data-id='JN4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Just then his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?” </span>
<span class='v JN4_28' data-id='JN4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, </span>
<span class='v JN4_29' data-id='JN4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” </span>
<span class='v JN4_30' data-id='JN4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>They went out of the town and were coming to him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_31' data-id='JN4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_32' data-id='JN4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_33' data-id='JN4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So the disciples said to one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?” </span>
<span class='v JN4_34' data-id='JN4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. </span>
<span class='v JN4_35' data-id='JN4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest. </span>
<span class='v JN4_36' data-id='JN4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together. </span>
<span class='v JN4_37' data-id='JN4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ </span>
<span class='v JN4_38' data-id='JN4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_39' data-id='JN4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_40' data-id='JN4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days. </span>
<span class='v JN4_41' data-id='JN4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And many more believed because of his word. </span>
<span class='v JN4_42' data-id='JN4_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_43' data-id='JN4_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>After the two days he departed for Galilee. </span>
<span class='v JN4_44' data-id='JN4_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>(For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) </span>
<span class='v JN4_45' data-id='JN4_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals an Official's Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN4_46' data-id='JN4_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill. </span>
<span class='v JN4_47' data-id='JN4_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death. </span>
<span class='v JN4_48' data-id='JN4_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_49' data-id='JN4_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_50' data-id='JN4_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went on his way. </span>
<span class='v JN4_51' data-id='JN4_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering. </span>
<span class='v JN4_52' data-id='JN4_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.” </span>
<span class='v JN4_53' data-id='JN4_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And he himself believed, and all his household. </span>
<span class='v JN4_54' data-id='JN4_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee. </span></div></div>
