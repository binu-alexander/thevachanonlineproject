<div class='s'>The Triumphal Entry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_1' data-id='MK11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples </span>
<span class='v MK11_2' data-id='MK11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. </span>
<span class='v MK11_3' data-id='MK11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MK11_4' data-id='MK11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. </span>
<span class='v MK11_5' data-id='MK11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” </span>
<span class='v MK11_6' data-id='MK11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. </span>
<span class='v MK11_7' data-id='MK11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. </span>
<span class='v MK11_8' data-id='MK11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. </span>
<span class='v MK11_9' data-id='MK11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! </span>
<span class='v MK11_10' data-id='MK11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_11' data-id='MK11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Curses the Fig Tree </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_12' data-id='MK11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. </span>
<span class='v MK11_13' data-id='MK11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. </span>
<span class='v MK11_14' data-id='MK11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Cleanses the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_15' data-id='MK11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. </span>
<span class='v MK11_16' data-id='MK11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. </span>
<span class='v MK11_17' data-id='MK11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he was teaching them and saying to them, “Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.” </span>
<span class='v MK11_18' data-id='MK11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. </span>
<span class='v MK11_19' data-id='MK11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And when evening came they went out of the city. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Lesson from the Withered Fig Tree </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_20' data-id='MK11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. </span>
<span class='v MK11_21' data-id='MK11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered.” </span>
<span class='v MK11_22' data-id='MK11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. </span>
<span class='v MK11_23' data-id='MK11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. </span>
<span class='v MK11_24' data-id='MK11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. </span>
<span class='v MK11_25' data-id='MK11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Authority of Jesus Challenged </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK11_27' data-id='MK11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> And they came again to Jeru salem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, </span>
<span class='v MK11_28' data-id='MK11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and they said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them?” </span>
<span class='v MK11_29' data-id='MK11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. </span>
<span class='v MK11_30' data-id='MK11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me.” </span>
<span class='v MK11_31' data-id='MK11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’ </span>
<span class='v MK11_32' data-id='MK11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But shall we say, ‘From man’?”—they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MK11_33' data-id='MK11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” </span></div></div>
