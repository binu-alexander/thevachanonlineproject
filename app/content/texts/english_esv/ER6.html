<div class='s'>The Decree of Darius </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER6_1' data-id='ER6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in Babylonia, in the house of the archives where the documents were stored. </span>
<span class='v ER6_2' data-id='ER6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And in Ecbatana, the capital that is in the province of Media, a scroll was found on which this was written: “A record. </span>
<span class='v ER6_3' data-id='ER6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king issued a decree: Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where sacrifices were offered, and let its foundations be retained.

<span class='v ER6_4' data-id='ER6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>with three layers of great stones and one layer of timber. Let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. </span>
<span class='v ER6_5' data-id='ER6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple that is in Jerusalem, each to its place. You shall put them in the house of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER6_6' data-id='ER6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates the governors who are in the province Beyond the River, keep away. </span>
<span class='v ER6_7' data-id='ER6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Let the work on this house of God alone. Let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site. </span>
<span class='v ER6_8' data-id='ER6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Moreover, I make a decree regarding what you shall do for these elders of the Jews for the rebuilding of this house of God. The cost is to be paid to these men in full and without delay from the royal revenue, the tribute of the province from Beyond the River. </span>
<span class='v ER6_9' data-id='ER6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And whatever is needed—bulls, rams, or sheep for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, or oil, as the priests at Jerusalem require—let that be given to them day by day without fail, </span>
<span class='v ER6_10' data-id='ER6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. </span>
<span class='v ER6_11' data-id='ER6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Also I make a decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house, and he shall be impaled on it, and his house shall be made a dunghill. </span>
<span class='v ER6_12' data-id='ER6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>May the God who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who shall put out a hand to alter this, or to destroy this house of God that is in Jerusalem. I Darius make a decree; let it be done with all diligence.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Temple Finished and Dedicated </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER6_13' data-id='ER6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then, according to the word sent by Darius the king, Tattenai, the governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered. </span>
<span class='v ER6_14' data-id='ER6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. They finished their building by decree of the God of Israel and by decree of Cyrus and Darius and Artaxerxes king of Persia; </span>
<span class='v ER6_15' data-id='ER6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and this house was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ER6_16' data-id='ER6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the people of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. </span>
<span class='v ER6_17' data-id='ER6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>They offered at the dedication of this house of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. </span>
<span class='v ER6_18' data-id='ER6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their divisions, for the service of God at Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses. </span></div>
