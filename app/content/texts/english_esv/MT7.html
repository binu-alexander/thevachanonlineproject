<div class='s'>Judging Others </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_1' data-id='MT7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> “Judge not, that you be not judged. </span>
<span class='v MT7_2' data-id='MT7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. </span>
<span class='v MT7_3' data-id='MT7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? </span>
<span class='v MT7_4' data-id='MT7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when there is the log in your own eye? </span>
<span class='v MT7_5' data-id='MT7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_6' data-id='MT7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Ask, and It Will Be Given </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_7' data-id='MT7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. </span>
<span class='v MT7_8' data-id='MT7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. </span>
<span class='v MT7_9' data-id='MT7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? </span>
<span class='v MT7_10' data-id='MT7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? </span>
<span class='v MT7_11' data-id='MT7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Golden Rule </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_12' data-id='MT7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_13' data-id='MT7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. </span>
<span class='v MT7_14' data-id='MT7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Tree and Its Fruit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_15' data-id='MT7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. </span>
<span class='v MT7_16' data-id='MT7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? </span>
<span class='v MT7_17' data-id='MT7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT7_18' data-id='MT7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT7_19' data-id='MT7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. </span>
<span class='v MT7_20' data-id='MT7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. </span></div>
<div class='s'>I Never Knew You </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_21' data-id='MT7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT7_22' data-id='MT7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ </span>
<span class='v MT7_23' data-id='MT7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’ </span></div>
<div class='s'>Build Your House on the Rock </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_24' data-id='MT7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. </span>
<span class='v MT7_25' data-id='MT7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. </span>
<span class='v MT7_26' data-id='MT7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. </span>
<span class='v MT7_27' data-id='MT7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Authority of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT7_28' data-id='MT7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, </span>
<span class='v MT7_29' data-id='MT7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes. </span></div></div>
