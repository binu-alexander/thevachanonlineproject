<div class='s'>The Pharisees and Sadducees Demand Signs </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_1' data-id='MT16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT16_2' data-id='MT16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He answered them, “When it is evening, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ </span>
<span class='v MT16_3' data-id='MT16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And in the morning, ‘It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. </span>
<span class='v MT16_4' data-id='MT16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” So he left them and departed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_5' data-id='MT16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread. </span>
<span class='v MT16_6' data-id='MT16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them, “Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_7' data-id='MT16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_8' data-id='MT16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, aware of this, said, “O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? </span>
<span class='v MT16_9' data-id='MT16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? </span>
<span class='v MT16_10' data-id='MT16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? </span>
<span class='v MT16_11' data-id='MT16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_12' data-id='MT16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Confesses Jesus As the Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_13' data-id='MT16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” </span>
<span class='v MT16_14' data-id='MT16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And they said, “Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_15' data-id='MT16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” </span>
<span class='v MT16_16' data-id='MT16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Simon Peter replied, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_17' data-id='MT16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT16_18' data-id='MT16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. </span>
<span class='v MT16_19' data-id='MT16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_20' data-id='MT16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Foretells His Death and Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_21' data-id='MT16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. </span>
<span class='v MT16_22' data-id='MT16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you.” </span>
<span class='v MT16_23' data-id='MT16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But he turned and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Take Up Your Cross and Follow Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT16_24' data-id='MT16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. </span>
<span class='v MT16_25' data-id='MT16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. </span>
<span class='v MT16_26' data-id='MT16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? </span>
<span class='v MT16_27' data-id='MT16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. </span>
<span class='v MT16_28' data-id='MT16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.” </span></div></div>
