<div class='c'>8</div>
<div class='s'>Saul Ravages the Church </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_1' data-id='AC8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Saul approved of his execution. </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC8_1' data-id='AC8_1'>And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. </span>
<span class='v AC8_2' data-id='AC8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. </span>
<span class='v AC8_3' data-id='AC8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Philip Proclaims Christ in Samaria </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_4' data-id='AC8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. </span>
<span class='v AC8_5' data-id='AC8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. </span>
<span class='v AC8_6' data-id='AC8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. </span>
<span class='v AC8_7' data-id='AC8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, crying with a loud voice, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. </span>
<span class='v AC8_8' data-id='AC8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So there was much joy in that city. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Simon the Magician Believes </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_9' data-id='AC8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. </span>
<span class='v AC8_10' data-id='AC8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called Great.” </span>
<span class='v AC8_11' data-id='AC8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. </span>
<span class='v AC8_12' data-id='AC8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. </span>
<span class='v AC8_13' data-id='AC8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_14' data-id='AC8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, </span>
<span class='v AC8_15' data-id='AC8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v AC8_16' data-id='AC8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC8_17' data-id='AC8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC8_18' data-id='AC8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money, </span>
<span class='v AC8_19' data-id='AC8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>saying, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.” </span>
<span class='v AC8_20' data-id='AC8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But Peter said to him, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! </span>
<span class='v AC8_21' data-id='AC8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. </span>
<span class='v AC8_22' data-id='AC8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. </span>
<span class='v AC8_23' data-id='AC8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.” </span>
<span class='v AC8_24' data-id='AC8_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And Simon answered, “Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_25' data-id='AC8_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC8_26' data-id='AC8_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” This is a desert place. </span>
<span class='v AC8_27' data-id='AC8_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship </span>
<span class='v AC8_28' data-id='AC8_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. </span>
<span class='v AC8_29' data-id='AC8_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” </span>
<span class='v AC8_30' data-id='AC8_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?” </span>
<span class='v AC8_31' data-id='AC8_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. </span>
<span class='v AC8_32' data-id='AC8_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC8_32' data-id='AC8_32'>“Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC8_32' data-id='AC8_32'>and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC8_32' data-id='AC8_32'>so he opens not his mouth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC8_33' data-id='AC8_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>In his humiliation justice was denied him. </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC8_33' data-id='AC8_33'>Who can describe his generation? </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC8_33' data-id='AC8_33'>For his life is taken away from the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC8_34' data-id='AC8_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And the eunuch said to Philip, “About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?” </span>
<span class='v AC8_35' data-id='AC8_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC8_36' data-id='AC8_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?” </span>
<span class='v AC8_38' data-id='AC8_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. </span>
<span class='v AC8_39' data-id='AC8_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. </span>
<span class='v AC8_40' data-id='AC8_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea. </span></div></div>
