<span class='v JS1_3' data-id='JS1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses. </span>

<span class='v JS1_5' data-id='JS1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forsake you. </span>
<span class='v JS1_6' data-id='JS1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them. </span>
<span class='v JS1_7' data-id='JS1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses my servant commanded you.

<span class='v JS1_8' data-id='JS1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.

<span class='v JS1_9' data-id='JS1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.” </span></div>

<span class='v JS1_10' data-id='JS1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Joshua commanded the officers of the people, </span>

<span class='v JS1_14' data-id='JS1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock shall remain in the land that Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brothers and shall help them, </span>
<span class='v JS1_15' data-id='JS1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>until the LORD gives rest to your brothers as he has to you, and they also take possession of the land that the LORD your God is giving them.
