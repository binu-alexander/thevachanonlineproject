<span class='v HS13_1' data-id='HS13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HS13_1' data-id='HS13_1'>he was exalted in Israel, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HS13_1' data-id='HS13_1'>but he incurred guilt through Baal and died. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HS13_2' data-id='HS13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And now they sin more and more, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HS13_2' data-id='HS13_2'>and make for themselves metal images, </span></div>
