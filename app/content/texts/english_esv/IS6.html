<div class='s'>Isaiah's Vision of the LORD </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_1' data-id='IS6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and the train of his robe filled the temple. </span>
<span class='v IS6_2' data-id='IS6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Above him stood the seraphim. Each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. </span>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And one called to another and said: </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'>“Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_3' data-id='IS6_3'>the whole earth is full of his glory!” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v IS6_4' data-id='IS6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke. </span>
<span class='v IS6_5' data-id='IS6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I said: “Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_6' data-id='IS6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken with tongs from the altar. </span>
<span class='v IS6_7' data-id='IS6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he touched my mouth and said: “Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Isaiah's Commission from the Lord </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS6_8' data-id='IS6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here am I! Send me.” </span>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Go, and say to this people: </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; 
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'>“ ‘Keep on hearing, but do not understand; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_9' data-id='IS6_9'>keep on seeing, but do not perceive.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Make the heart of this people dull, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>and their ears heavy, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>and blind their eyes; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>lest they see with their eyes, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>and hear with their ears, </span></div>

<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>and understand with their hearts, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_10' data-id='IS6_10'>and turn and be healed.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I said, “How long, O Lord?” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>And he said: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>“Until cities lie waste </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>without inhabitant, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>and houses without people, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_11' data-id='IS6_11'>and the land is a desolate waste, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_12' data-id='IS6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and the LORD removes people far away, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_12' data-id='IS6_12'>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And though a tenth remain in it, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'>it will be burned again, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'>like a terebinth or an oak, </span></div>

<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'>whose stump remains </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'>when it is felled.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v IS6_13' data-id='IS6_13'>The holy seed is its stump. </span></div></div>
