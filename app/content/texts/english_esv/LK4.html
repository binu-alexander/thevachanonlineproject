<div class='s'>The Temptation of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_1' data-id='LK4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness </span>
<span class='v LK4_2' data-id='LK4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for forty days, being tempted by the devil. And he ate nothing during those days. And when they were ended, he was hungry. </span>
<span class='v LK4_3' data-id='LK4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_4' data-id='LK4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered him, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’ ” </span>
<span class='v LK4_5' data-id='LK4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, </span>
<span class='v LK4_6' data-id='LK4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will. </span>
<span class='v LK4_7' data-id='LK4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_8' data-id='LK4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered him, “It is written, </span></div>

<span class='v LK4_9' data-id='LK4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, </span>
<span class='v LK4_10' data-id='LK4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for it is written, </span></div>

<div class='s'>Jesus Begins His Ministry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_14' data-id='LK4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and a report about him went out through all the surrounding country. </span>
<span class='v LK4_15' data-id='LK4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_16' data-id='LK4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as was his custom, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and he stood up to read. </span>
<span class='v LK4_17' data-id='LK4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK4_18' data-id='LK4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK4_18' data-id='LK4_18'>because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK4_18' data-id='LK4_18'>He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives </span></div>
<div class='q2'>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v LK4_18' data-id='LK4_18'>to set at liberty those who are oppressed, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v LK4_19' data-id='LK4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.” </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v LK4_20' data-id='LK4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. </span>
<span class='v LK4_21' data-id='LK4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he began to say to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_22' data-id='LK4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And all spoke well of him and marveled at the gracious words that were coming from his mouth. And they said, “Is not this Joseph's son?” </span>
<span class='v LK4_23' data-id='LK4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Doubtless you will quote to me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself.’ What we have heard you did at Capernaum, do here in your hometown as well.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_24' data-id='LK4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Truly, I say to you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. </span>
<span class='v LK4_25' data-id='LK4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But in truth, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were shut up three years and six months, and a great famine came over all the land, </span>
<span class='v LK4_26' data-id='LK4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and Elijah was sent to none of them but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. </span>
<span class='v LK4_27' data-id='LK4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_28' data-id='LK4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When they heard these things, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath. </span>
<span class='v LK4_29' data-id='LK4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. </span>
<span class='v LK4_30' data-id='LK4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>But passing through their midst, he went away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man with an Unclean Demon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_31' data-id='LK4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And he was teaching them on the Sabbath, </span>
<span class='v LK4_32' data-id='LK4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>and they were astonished at his teaching, for his word possessed authority. </span>
<span class='v LK4_33' data-id='LK4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, </span>
<span class='v LK4_34' data-id='LK4_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_35' data-id='LK4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, he came out of him, having done him no harm. </span>
<span class='v LK4_36' data-id='LK4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And they were all amazed and said to one another, “What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” </span>
<span class='v LK4_37' data-id='LK4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And reports about him went out into every place in the surrounding region. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Many </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_38' data-id='LK4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span> And he arose and left the synagogue and entered Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they appealed to him on her behalf. </span>
<span class='v LK4_39' data-id='LK4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she rose and began to serve them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_40' data-id='LK4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them. </span>
<span class='v LK4_41' data-id='LK4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And demons also came out of many, crying, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK4_42' data-id='LK4_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span> And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place. And the people sought him and came to him, and would have kept him from leaving them, </span>
<span class='v LK4_43' data-id='LK4_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>but he said to them, “I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well; for I was sent for this purpose.” </span>
<span class='v LK4_44' data-id='LK4_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea. </span></div></div>
