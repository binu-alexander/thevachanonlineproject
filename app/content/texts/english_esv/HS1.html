<span class='v HS1_2' data-id='HS1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>When the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, “Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have children of whoredom, for the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the LORD.” </span>
<span class='v HS1_3' data-id='HS1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son. </span></div>
