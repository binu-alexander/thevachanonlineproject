<div class='s'>Hezekiah's Sickness and Recovery </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS38_1' data-id='IS38_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In those days Hezekiah became sick and was at the point of death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: Set your house in order, for you shall die, you shall not recover.” </span>
<span class='v IS38_2' data-id='IS38_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, </span>
<span class='v IS38_3' data-id='IS38_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and said, “Please, O LORD, remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS38_4' data-id='IS38_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to Isaiah: </span>
<span class='v IS38_5' data-id='IS38_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus says the LORD, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I will add fifteen years to your life. </span>
<span class='v IS38_6' data-id='IS38_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and will defend this city. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS38_7' data-id='IS38_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“This shall be the sign to you from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he has promised: </span>
<span class='v IS38_8' data-id='IS38_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps.” So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined. </span></div>

<span class='v IS38_9' data-id='IS38_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, after he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness: </span></div>
