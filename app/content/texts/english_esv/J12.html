<div class='s'>Christ Our Advocate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_1' data-id='J12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. </span>
<span class='v J12_2' data-id='J12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world. </span>
<span class='v J12_3' data-id='J12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. </span>
<span class='v J12_4' data-id='J12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, </span>
<span class='v J12_5' data-id='J12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may be sure that we are in him: </span>
<span class='v J12_6' data-id='J12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The New Commandment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_7' data-id='J12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard. </span>
<span class='v J12_8' data-id='J12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. </span>
<span class='v J12_9' data-id='J12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness. </span>
<span class='v J12_10' data-id='J12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling. </span>
<span class='v J12_11' data-id='J12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v J12_12' data-id='J12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I am writing to you, little children, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v J12_12' data-id='J12_12'>because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake. </span></div>

<div class='q2'>

<div class='s'>Do Not Love the World </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_15' data-id='J12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. </span>
<span class='v J12_16' data-id='J12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. </span>
<span class='v J12_17' data-id='J12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Warning Concerning Antichrists </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_18' data-id='J12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour. </span>
<span class='v J12_19' data-id='J12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us. </span>
<span class='v J12_20' data-id='J12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. </span>
<span class='v J12_21' data-id='J12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. </span>
<span class='v J12_22' data-id='J12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. </span>
<span class='v J12_23' data-id='J12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. </span>
<span class='v J12_24' data-id='J12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. </span>
<span class='v J12_25' data-id='J12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And this is the promise that he made to us —eternal life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_26' data-id='J12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. </span>
<span class='v J12_27' data-id='J12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything—and is true and is no lie, just as it has taught you—abide in him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Children of God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J12_28' data-id='J12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming. </span>
<span class='v J12_29' data-id='J12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him. </span></div></div>
