<span class='v GN1_7' data-id='GN1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And God made the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. </span>
<span class='v GN1_8' data-id='GN1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And God called the expanse Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day. </span></div>

<span class='v GN1_21' data-id='GN1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. </span>
<span class='v GN1_22' data-id='GN1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” </span>
