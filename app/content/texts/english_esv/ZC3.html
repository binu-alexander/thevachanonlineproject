<div class='s'>A Vision of Joshua the High Priest </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC3_1' data-id='ZC3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_2' data-id='ZC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to Satan, “The LORD rebuke you, O Satan! The LORD who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire?” </span>
<span class='v ZC3_3' data-id='ZC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_4' data-id='ZC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to those who were standing before him, “Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments.” </span>
<span class='v ZC3_5' data-id='ZC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I said, “Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD was standing by. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC3_6' data-id='ZC3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD solemnly assured Joshua, </span>
<span class='v ZC3_7' data-id='ZC3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_8' data-id='ZC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_9' data-id='ZC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven eyes, I will engrave its inscription, declares the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. </span>
<span class='v ZC3_10' data-id='ZC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In that day, declares the LORD of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree.” </span></div></div>
