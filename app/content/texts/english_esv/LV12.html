<span class='v LV12_3' data-id='LV12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. </span>
<span class='v LV12_4' data-id='LV12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then she shall continue for thirty-three days in the blood of her purifying. She shall not touch anything holy, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed. </span>

<span class='v LV12_7' data-id='LV12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her. Then she shall be clean from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who bears a child, either male or female. </span>
<span class='v LV12_8' data-id='LV12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And if she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering.
