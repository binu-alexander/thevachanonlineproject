<div class='s'>A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_1' data-id='T22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v T22_2' data-id='T22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. </span>
<span class='v T22_3' data-id='T22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v T22_4' data-id='T22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him. </span>
<span class='v T22_5' data-id='T22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. </span>
<span class='v T22_6' data-id='T22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops. </span>
<span class='v T22_7' data-id='T22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_8' data-id='T22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel, </span>
<span class='v T22_9' data-id='T22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound! </span>
<span class='v T22_10' data-id='T22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. </span>
<span class='v T22_11' data-id='T22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The saying is trustworthy, for: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T22_11' data-id='T22_11'>If we have died with him, we will also live with him; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T22_12' data-id='T22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>if we endure, we will also reign with him; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v T22_12' data-id='T22_12'>if we deny him, he also will deny us; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T22_13' data-id='T22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>if we are faithless, he remains faithful— </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v T22_13' data-id='T22_13'>for he cannot deny himself. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Worker Approved by God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_14' data-id='T22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers. </span>
<span class='v T22_15' data-id='T22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. </span>
<span class='v T22_16' data-id='T22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, </span>
<span class='v T22_17' data-id='T22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, </span>
<span class='v T22_18' data-id='T22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some. </span>
<span class='v T22_19' data-id='T22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_20' data-id='T22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable. </span>
<span class='v T22_21' data-id='T22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T22_22' data-id='T22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart. </span>
<span class='v T22_23' data-id='T22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels. </span>
<span class='v T22_24' data-id='T22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, </span>
<span class='v T22_25' data-id='T22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, </span>
<span class='v T22_26' data-id='T22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and they may escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will. </span></div></div>
