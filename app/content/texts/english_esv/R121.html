<div class='s'>David's Census Brings Pestilence </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_1' data-id='R121_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel. </span>
<span class='v R121_2' data-id='R121_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.” </span>
<span class='v R121_3' data-id='R121_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But Joab said, “May the LORD add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord's servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?” </span>
<span class='v R121_4' data-id='R121_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the king's word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v R121_5' data-id='R121_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword. </span>
<span class='v R121_6' data-id='R121_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king's command was abhorrent to Joab. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_7' data-id='R121_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel. </span>
<span class='v R121_8' data-id='R121_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” </span>
<span class='v R121_9' data-id='R121_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying, </span>
<span class='v R121_10' data-id='R121_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.’ ” </span>
<span class='v R121_11' data-id='R121_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, ‘Choose what you will: </span>
<span class='v R121_12' data-id='R121_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>either three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the LORD, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.” </span>
<span class='v R121_13' data-id='R121_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_14' data-id='R121_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the LORD sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell. </span>
<span class='v R121_15' data-id='R121_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the LORD saw, and he relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, “It is enough; now stay your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class='v R121_16' data-id='R121_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the LORD standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. </span>
<span class='v R121_17' data-id='R121_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O LORD my God, be against me and against my father's house. But do not let the plague be on your people.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>David Builds an Altar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_18' data-id='R121_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now the angel of the LORD had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span>
<span class='v R121_19' data-id='R121_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So David went up at Gad's word, which he had spoken in the name of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v R121_20' data-id='R121_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. </span>
<span class='v R121_21' data-id='R121_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground. </span>
<span class='v R121_22' data-id='R121_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the LORD—give it to me at its full price—that the plague may be averted from the people.” </span>
<span class='v R121_23' data-id='R121_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Ornan said to David, “Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.” </span>
<span class='v R121_24' data-id='R121_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the LORD what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” </span>
<span class='v R121_25' data-id='R121_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. </span>
<span class='v R121_26' data-id='R121_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And David built there an altar to the LORD and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the LORD, and the LORD answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. </span>
<span class='v R121_27' data-id='R121_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R121_28' data-id='R121_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>At that time, when David saw that the LORD had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. </span>
<span class='v R121_29' data-id='R121_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon, </span>
<span class='v R121_30' data-id='R121_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the LORD. </span></div></div>
