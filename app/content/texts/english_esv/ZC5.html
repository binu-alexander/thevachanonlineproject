<span class='v ZC5_1' data-id='ZC5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll! </span>
<span class='v ZC5_2' data-id='ZC5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.” </span>
<span class='v ZC5_3' data-id='ZC5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land.

<span class='v ZC5_4' data-id='ZC5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I will send it out, declares the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name.
