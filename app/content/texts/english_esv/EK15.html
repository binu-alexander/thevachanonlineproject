<span class='v EK15_1' data-id='EK15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK15_2' data-id='EK15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine surpass any wood, the vine branch that is among the trees of the forest? </span>
<span class='v EK15_3' data-id='EK15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Is wood taken from it to make anything? Do people take a peg from it to hang any vessel on it? </span>
<span class='v EK15_4' data-id='EK15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel. When the fire has consumed both ends of it, and the middle of it is charred, is it useful for anything? </span>
<span class='v EK15_5' data-id='EK15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Behold, when it was whole, it was used for nothing. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it ever be used for anything! </span>
<span class='v EK15_6' data-id='EK15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v EK15_7' data-id='EK15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I will set my face against them. Though they escape from the fire, the fire shall yet consume them, and you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. </span>
<span class='v EK15_8' data-id='EK15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted faithlessly, declares the Lord GOD.” </span></div></div>
