<div class='s'>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_1' data-id='MT12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. </span>
<span class='v MT12_2' data-id='MT12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath.” </span>
<span class='v MT12_3' data-id='MT12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: </span>
<span class='v MT12_4' data-id='MT12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? </span>
<span class='v MT12_5' data-id='MT12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? </span>
<span class='v MT12_6' data-id='MT12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. </span>
<span class='v MT12_7' data-id='MT12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. </span>
<span class='v MT12_8' data-id='MT12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Man with a Withered Hand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_9' data-id='MT12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He went on from there and entered their synagogue. </span>
<span class='v MT12_10' data-id='MT12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—so that they might accuse him. </span>
<span class='v MT12_11' data-id='MT12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? </span>
<span class='v MT12_12' data-id='MT12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” </span>
<span class='v MT12_13' data-id='MT12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other. </span>
<span class='v MT12_14' data-id='MT12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God's Chosen Servant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_15' data-id='MT12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all </span>
<span class='v MT12_16' data-id='MT12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and ordered them not to make him known. </span>
<span class='v MT12_17' data-id='MT12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_18' data-id='MT12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT12_18' data-id='MT12_18'>my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_18' data-id='MT12_18'>I will put my Spirit upon him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT12_18' data-id='MT12_18'>and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_19' data-id='MT12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He will not quarrel or cry aloud, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT12_19' data-id='MT12_19'>nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_20' data-id='MT12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>a bruised reed he will not break, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT12_20' data-id='MT12_20'>and a smoldering wick he will not quench, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_20' data-id='MT12_20'>until he brings justice to victory; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT12_21' data-id='MT12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>and in his name the Gentiles will hope.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_22' data-id='MT12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span> Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. </span>
<span class='v MT12_23' data-id='MT12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And all the people were amazed, and said, “Can this be the Son of David?” </span>
<span class='v MT12_24' data-id='MT12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, “It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” </span>
<span class='v MT12_25' data-id='MT12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. </span>
<span class='v MT12_26' data-id='MT12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? </span>
<span class='v MT12_27' data-id='MT12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. </span>
<span class='v MT12_28' data-id='MT12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. </span>
<span class='v MT12_29' data-id='MT12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. </span>
<span class='v MT12_30' data-id='MT12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. </span>
<span class='v MT12_31' data-id='MT12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. </span>
<span class='v MT12_32' data-id='MT12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_33' data-id='MT12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. </span>
<span class='v MT12_34' data-id='MT12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. </span>
<span class='v MT12_35' data-id='MT12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. </span>
<span class='v MT12_36' data-id='MT12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, </span>
<span class='v MT12_37' data-id='MT12_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Sign of Jonah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_38' data-id='MT12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.” </span>
<span class='v MT12_39' data-id='MT12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. </span>
<span class='v MT12_40' data-id='MT12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </span>
<span class='v MT12_41' data-id='MT12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. </span>
<span class='v MT12_42' data-id='MT12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Return of an Unclean Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_43' data-id='MT12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>“When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. </span>
<span class='v MT12_44' data-id='MT12_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. </span>
<span class='v MT12_45' data-id='MT12_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus' Mother and Brothers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT12_46' data-id='MT12_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. </span>
<span class='v MT12_48' data-id='MT12_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>But he replied to the man who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?” </span>
<span class='v MT12_49' data-id='MT12_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span>
<span class='v MT12_50' data-id='MT12_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” </span></div></div>
