<div class='s'>The Scroll and the Lamb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_1' data-id='RV5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. </span>
<span class='v RV5_2' data-id='RV5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” </span>
<span class='v RV5_3' data-id='RV5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it, </span>
<span class='v RV5_4' data-id='RV5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. </span>
<span class='v RV5_5' data-id='RV5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV5_6' data-id='RV5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV5_7' data-id='RV5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV5_8' data-id='RV5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. </span>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And they sang a new song, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>“Worthy are you to take the scroll </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>and to open its seals, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_9' data-id='RV5_9'>from every tribe and language and people and nation, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV5_10' data-id='RV5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV5_10' data-id='RV5_10'>and they shall reign on the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV5_11' data-id='RV5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands, </span>
<span class='v RV5_12' data-id='RV5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!” </span>
<span class='v RV5_13' data-id='RV5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!” </span>
<span class='v RV5_14' data-id='RV5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped. </span></div>
