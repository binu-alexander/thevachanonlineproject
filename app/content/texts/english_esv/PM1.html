</div>
<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='s'>Greeting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_1' data-id='PM1_1'>To Philemon our beloved fellow worker </span>
<span class='v PM1_2' data-id='PM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_3' data-id='PM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Philemon's Love and Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_4' data-id='PM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, </span>
<span class='v PM1_5' data-id='PM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints, </span>
<span class='v PM1_6' data-id='PM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PM1_7' data-id='PM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul's Plea for Onesimus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_8' data-id='PM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, </span>
<span class='v PM1_9' data-id='PM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus— </span>
<span class='v PM1_10' data-id='PM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. </span>
<span class='v PM1_11' data-id='PM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) </span>
<span class='v PM1_12' data-id='PM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. </span>
<span class='v PM1_13' data-id='PM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, </span>
<span class='v PM1_14' data-id='PM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. </span>
<span class='v PM1_15' data-id='PM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, </span>
<span class='v PM1_16' data-id='PM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_17' data-id='PM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. </span>
<span class='v PM1_18' data-id='PM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. </span>
<span class='v PM1_19' data-id='PM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. </span>
<span class='v PM1_20' data-id='PM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_21' data-id='PM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. </span>
<span class='v PM1_22' data-id='PM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Greetings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_23' data-id='PM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, </span>
<span class='v PM1_24' data-id='PM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PM1_25' data-id='PM1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </span></div></div>
