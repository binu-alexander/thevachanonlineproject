<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Paralytic </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_1' data-id='MT9_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. </span>
<span class='v MT9_2' data-id='MT9_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_3' data-id='MT9_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_4' data-id='MT9_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? </span>
<span class='v MT9_5' data-id='MT9_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’? </span>
<span class='v MT9_6' data-id='MT9_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralytic—“Rise, pick up your bed and go home.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_7' data-id='MT9_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he rose and went home. </span>
<span class='v MT9_8' data-id='MT9_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Calls Matthew </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_9' data-id='MT9_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span> As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me.” And he rose and followed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_10' data-id='MT9_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT9_11' data-id='MT9_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” </span>
<span class='v MT9_12' data-id='MT9_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when he heard it, he said, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. </span>
<span class='v MT9_13' data-id='MT9_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Go and learn what this means, ‘I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.’ For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Question About Fasting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_14' data-id='MT9_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?” </span>
<span class='v MT9_15' data-id='MT9_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. </span>
<span class='v MT9_16' data-id='MT9_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. </span>
<span class='v MT9_17' data-id='MT9_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_18' data-id='MT9_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_19' data-id='MT9_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT9_20' data-id='MT9_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, </span>
<span class='v MT9_21' data-id='MT9_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>for she said to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made well.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_22' data-id='MT9_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And instantly the woman was made well. </span>
<span class='v MT9_23' data-id='MT9_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, </span>
<span class='v MT9_24' data-id='MT9_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>he said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed at him. </span>
<span class='v MT9_25' data-id='MT9_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. </span>
<span class='v MT9_26' data-id='MT9_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the report of this went through all that district. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Two Blind Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_27' data-id='MT9_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_28' data-id='MT9_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_29' data-id='MT9_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith be it done to you.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_30' data-id='MT9_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about it.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_31' data-id='MT9_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But they went away and spread his fame through all that district. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Man Unable to Speak </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_32' data-id='MT9_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him. </span>
<span class='v MT9_33' data-id='MT9_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, “Never was anything like this seen in Israel.” </span>
<span class='v MT9_34' data-id='MT9_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>But the Pharisees said, “He casts out demons by the prince of demons.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Harvest Is Plentiful, the Laborers Few </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT9_35' data-id='MT9_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. </span>
<span class='v MT9_36' data-id='MT9_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. </span>
<span class='v MT9_37' data-id='MT9_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; </span>
<span class='v MT9_38' data-id='MT9_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.” </span></div></div>
