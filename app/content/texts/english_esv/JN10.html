<div class='s'>I Am the Good Shepherd </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_1' data-id='JN10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“Truly, truly, I say to you, he who does not enter the sheepfold by the door but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. </span>
<span class='v JN10_2' data-id='JN10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_3' data-id='JN10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>To him the gatekeeper opens. The sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. </span>
<span class='v JN10_4' data-id='JN10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When he has brought out all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice. </span>
<span class='v JN10_5' data-id='JN10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>A stranger they will not follow, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_6' data-id='JN10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>This figure of speech Jesus used with them, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_7' data-id='JN10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So Jesus again said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_8' data-id='JN10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_9' data-id='JN10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. </span>
<span class='v JN10_10' data-id='JN10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly. </span>
<span class='v JN10_11' data-id='JN10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_12' data-id='JN10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. </span>
<span class='v JN10_13' data-id='JN10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He flees because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_14' data-id='JN10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, </span>
<span class='v JN10_15' data-id='JN10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. </span>
<span class='v JN10_16' data-id='JN10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one shepherd. </span>
<span class='v JN10_17' data-id='JN10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it up again. </span>
<span class='v JN10_18' data-id='JN10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This charge I have received from my Father.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_19' data-id='JN10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words. </span>
<span class='v JN10_20' data-id='JN10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Many of them said, “He has a demon, and is insane; why listen to him?” </span>
<span class='v JN10_21' data-id='JN10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>I and the Father Are One </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_22' data-id='JN10_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter, </span>
<span class='v JN10_23' data-id='JN10_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the colonnade of Solomon. </span>
<span class='v JN10_24' data-id='JN10_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_25' data-id='JN10_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name bear witness about me, </span>
<span class='v JN10_26' data-id='JN10_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>but you do not believe because you are not part of my flock. </span>
<span class='v JN10_27' data-id='JN10_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. </span>
<span class='v JN10_28' data-id='JN10_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. </span>
<span class='v JN10_29' data-id='JN10_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. </span>
<span class='v JN10_30' data-id='JN10_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I and the Father are one.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_31' data-id='JN10_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The Jews picked up stones again to stone him. </span>
<span class='v JN10_32' data-id='JN10_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?” </span>
<span class='v JN10_33' data-id='JN10_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_34' data-id='JN10_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I said, you are gods’? </span>
<span class='v JN10_35' data-id='JN10_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken— </span>
<span class='v JN10_36' data-id='JN10_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? </span>
<span class='v JN10_37' data-id='JN10_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>If I am not doing the works of my Father, then do not believe me; </span>
<span class='v JN10_38' data-id='JN10_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_39' data-id='JN10_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN10_40' data-id='JN10_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained. </span>
<span class='v JN10_41' data-id='JN10_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And many came to him. And they said, “John did no sign, but everything that John said about this man was true.” </span>
<span class='v JN10_42' data-id='JN10_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And many believed in him there. </span></div></div>
