<div class='s'>Walk in Love </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_1' data-id='EP5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. </span>
<span class='v EP5_2' data-id='EP5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_3' data-id='EP5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. </span>
<span class='v EP5_4' data-id='EP5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving. </span>
<span class='v EP5_5' data-id='EP5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. </span>
<span class='v EP5_6' data-id='EP5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. </span>
<span class='v EP5_7' data-id='EP5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not associate with them; </span>
<span class='v EP5_8' data-id='EP5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light </span>
<span class='v EP5_9' data-id='EP5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true), </span>
<span class='v EP5_10' data-id='EP5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP5_11' data-id='EP5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. </span>
<span class='v EP5_12' data-id='EP5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. </span>
<span class='v EP5_13' data-id='EP5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, </span>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'>“Awake, O sleeper, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'>and arise from the dead, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EP5_14' data-id='EP5_14'>and Christ will shine on you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_15' data-id='EP5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, </span>
<span class='v EP5_16' data-id='EP5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. </span>
<span class='v EP5_17' data-id='EP5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. </span>
<span class='v EP5_18' data-id='EP5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit, </span>
<span class='v EP5_19' data-id='EP5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart, </span>
<span class='v EP5_20' data-id='EP5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP5_21' data-id='EP5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Wives and Husbands </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_22' data-id='EP5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP5_23' data-id='EP5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. </span>
<span class='v EP5_24' data-id='EP5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP5_25' data-id='EP5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, </span>
<span class='v EP5_26' data-id='EP5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, </span>
<span class='v EP5_27' data-id='EP5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. </span>
<span class='v EP5_28' data-id='EP5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. </span>
<span class='v EP5_29' data-id='EP5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, </span>
<span class='v EP5_30' data-id='EP5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>because we are members of his body. </span>
<span class='v EP5_31' data-id='EP5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.” </span>
<span class='v EP5_32' data-id='EP5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. </span>
<span class='v EP5_33' data-id='EP5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband. </span></div></div>
