<br><div class='c'>11</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_1' data-id='C111_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Head Coverings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_2' data-id='C111_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. </span>
<span class='v C111_3' data-id='C111_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. </span>
<span class='v C111_4' data-id='C111_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, </span>
<span class='v C111_5' data-id='C111_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head—it is the same as if her head were shaven. </span>
<span class='v C111_6' data-id='C111_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. </span>
<span class='v C111_7' data-id='C111_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. </span>
<span class='v C111_8' data-id='C111_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. </span>
<span class='v C111_9' data-id='C111_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. </span>
<span class='v C111_10' data-id='C111_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. </span>
<span class='v C111_11' data-id='C111_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; </span>
<span class='v C111_12' data-id='C111_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. </span>
<span class='v C111_13' data-id='C111_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? </span>
<span class='v C111_14' data-id='C111_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, </span>
<span class='v C111_15' data-id='C111_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. </span>
<span class='v C111_16' data-id='C111_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Lord's Supper </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_17' data-id='C111_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse. </span>
<span class='v C111_18' data-id='C111_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part, </span>
<span class='v C111_19' data-id='C111_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized. </span>
<span class='v C111_20' data-id='C111_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat. </span>
<span class='v C111_21' data-id='C111_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk. </span>
<span class='v C111_22' data-id='C111_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_23' data-id='C111_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, </span>
<span class='v C111_24' data-id='C111_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” </span>
<span class='v C111_25' data-id='C111_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” </span>
<span class='v C111_26' data-id='C111_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_27' data-id='C111_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C111_28' data-id='C111_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. </span>
<span class='v C111_29' data-id='C111_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. </span>
<span class='v C111_30' data-id='C111_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. </span>
<span class='v C111_31' data-id='C111_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. </span>
<span class='v C111_32' data-id='C111_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C111_33' data-id='C111_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— </span>
<span class='v C111_34' data-id='C111_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come. </span></div></div>
