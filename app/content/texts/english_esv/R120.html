<span class='v R120_2' data-id='R120_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. </span>
<span class='v R120_3' data-id='R120_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and axes.
