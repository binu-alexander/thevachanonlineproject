<div class='s'>Prophecy and Tongues </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_1' data-id='C114_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. </span>
<span class='v C114_2' data-id='C114_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit. </span>
<span class='v C114_3' data-id='C114_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. </span>
<span class='v C114_4' data-id='C114_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. </span>
<span class='v C114_5' data-id='C114_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_6' data-id='C114_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching? </span>
<span class='v C114_7' data-id='C114_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? </span>
<span class='v C114_8' data-id='C114_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle? </span>
<span class='v C114_9' data-id='C114_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air. </span>
<span class='v C114_10' data-id='C114_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning, </span>
<span class='v C114_11' data-id='C114_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. </span>
<span class='v C114_12' data-id='C114_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_13' data-id='C114_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret. </span>
<span class='v C114_14' data-id='C114_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful. </span>
<span class='v C114_15' data-id='C114_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also. </span>
<span class='v C114_16' data-id='C114_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say “Amen” to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying? </span>
<span class='v C114_17' data-id='C114_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up. </span>
<span class='v C114_18' data-id='C114_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. </span>
<span class='v C114_19' data-id='C114_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_20' data-id='C114_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. </span>
<span class='v C114_21' data-id='C114_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>In the Law it is written, “By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.” </span>
<span class='v C114_22' data-id='C114_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers. </span>
<span class='v C114_23' data-id='C114_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds? </span>
<span class='v C114_24' data-id='C114_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all, </span>
<span class='v C114_25' data-id='C114_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Orderly Worship </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_26' data-id='C114_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. </span>
<span class='v C114_27' data-id='C114_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret. </span>
<span class='v C114_28' data-id='C114_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. </span>
<span class='v C114_29' data-id='C114_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said. </span>
<span class='v C114_30' data-id='C114_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent. </span>
<span class='v C114_31' data-id='C114_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged, </span>
<span class='v C114_32' data-id='C114_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. </span>
<span class='v C114_33' data-id='C114_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_33' data-id='C114_33'>As in all the churches of the saints, </span>
<span class='v C114_34' data-id='C114_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says. </span>
<span class='v C114_35' data-id='C114_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C114_36' data-id='C114_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached? </span>
<span class='v C114_37' data-id='C114_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C114_38' data-id='C114_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. </span>
<span class='v C114_39' data-id='C114_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues. </span>
<span class='v C114_40' data-id='C114_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But all things should be done decently and in order. </span></div></div>
