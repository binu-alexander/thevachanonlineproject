<div class='s'>The Two Witnesses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_1' data-id='RV11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there, </span>
<span class='v RV11_2' data-id='RV11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months. </span>
<span class='v RV11_3' data-id='RV11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_4' data-id='RV11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV11_5' data-id='RV11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed. </span>
<span class='v RV11_6' data-id='RV11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire. </span>
<span class='v RV11_7' data-id='RV11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them, </span>
<span class='v RV11_8' data-id='RV11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified. </span>
<span class='v RV11_9' data-id='RV11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb, </span>
<span class='v RV11_10' data-id='RV11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth. </span>
<span class='v RV11_11' data-id='RV11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_12' data-id='RV11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them. </span>
<span class='v RV11_13' data-id='RV11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_14' data-id='RV11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Seventh Trumpet </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_15' data-id='RV11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.” </span>
<span class='v RV11_16' data-id='RV11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God, </span>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>who is and who was, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>for you have taken your great power </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_17' data-id='RV11_17'>and begun to reign. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The nations raged, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>but your wrath came, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and the time for the dead to be judged, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and those who fear your name, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>both small and great, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV11_18' data-id='RV11_18'>and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV11_19' data-id='RV11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. </span></div></div>
