<div class='s'>A Vision of a Golden Lampstand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_1' data-id='ZC4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_2' data-id='ZC4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_3' data-id='ZC4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_4' data-id='ZC4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And I said to the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_5' data-id='ZC4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_6' data-id='ZC4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the LORD of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_7' data-id='ZC4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_8' data-id='ZC4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v ZC4_9' data-id='ZC4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. </span>
<span class='v ZC4_10' data-id='ZC4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC4_10' data-id='ZC4_10'>“These seven are the eyes of the LORD, which range through the whole earth.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_11' data-id='ZC4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I said to him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_12' data-id='ZC4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And a second time I answered and said to him, “What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out?” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_13' data-id='ZC4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He said to me, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.” </span>
<span class='v ZC4_14' data-id='ZC4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.” </span></div></div>
