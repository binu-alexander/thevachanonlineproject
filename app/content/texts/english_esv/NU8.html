<span class='v NU8_1' data-id='NU8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class='v NU8_2' data-id='NU8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Speak to Aaron and say to him, When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.” </span>
<span class='v NU8_3' data-id='NU8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Aaron did so: he set up its lamps in front of the lampstand, as the LORD commanded Moses. </span>
<span class='v NU8_4' data-id='NU8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And this was the workmanship of the lampstand, hammered work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was hammered work; according to the pattern that the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand. </span></div>

<span class='v NU8_7' data-id='NU8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification upon them, and let them go with a razor over all their body, and wash their clothes and cleanse themselves. </span>
<span class='v NU8_8' data-id='NU8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then let them take a bull from the herd and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another bull from the herd for a sin offering. </span>

<span class='v NU8_16' data-id='NU8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For they are wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself. </span>
<span class='v NU8_17' data-id='NU8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself, </span>
