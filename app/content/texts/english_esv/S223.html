<div class='s'>David's Mighty Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_8' data-id='S223_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite; he was chief of the three. He wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_9' data-id='S223_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. </span>
<span class='v S223_10' data-id='S223_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the LORD brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_11' data-id='S223_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines. </span>
<span class='v S223_12' data-id='S223_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the LORD worked a great victory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_13' data-id='S223_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. </span>
<span class='v S223_14' data-id='S223_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. </span>
<span class='v S223_15' data-id='S223_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And David said longingly, “Oh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!” </span>
<span class='v S223_16' data-id='S223_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the LORD </span>
<span class='v S223_17' data-id='S223_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and said, “Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_18' data-id='S223_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three. </span>
<span class='v S223_19' data-id='S223_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S223_20' data-id='S223_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. </span>
<span class='v S223_21' data-id='S223_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. </span>
<span class='v S223_22' data-id='S223_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. </span>
<span class='v S223_23' data-id='S223_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard. </span></div>
