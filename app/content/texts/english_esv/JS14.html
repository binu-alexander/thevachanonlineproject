<div class='s'>The Inheritance West of the Jordan </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_1' data-id='JS14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>These are the inheritances that the people of Israel received in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel gave them to inherit. </span>
<span class='v JS14_2' data-id='JS14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Their inheritance was by lot, just as the LORD had commanded by the hand of Moses for the nine and one-half tribes. </span>
<span class='v JS14_3' data-id='JS14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Moses had given an inheritance to the two and one-half tribes beyond the Jordan, but to the Levites he gave no inheritance among them. </span>
<span class='v JS14_4' data-id='JS14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For the people of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And no portion was given to the Levites in the land, but only cities to dwell in, with their pasturelands for their livestock and their substance. </span>
<span class='v JS14_5' data-id='JS14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The people of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses; they allotted the land. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Caleb's Request and Inheritance </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_6' data-id='JS14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the LORD said to Moses the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. </span>
<span class='v JS14_7' data-id='JS14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in my heart. </span>
<span class='v JS14_8' data-id='JS14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt; yet I wholly followed the LORD my God. </span>
<span class='v JS14_9' data-id='JS14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.’ </span>
<span class='v JS14_10' data-id='JS14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, just as he said, these forty-five years since the time that the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old. </span>
<span class='v JS14_11' data-id='JS14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I am still as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; my strength now is as my strength was then, for war and for going and coming. </span>
<span class='v JS14_12' data-id='JS14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So now give me this hill country of which the LORD spoke on that day, for you heard on that day how the Anakim were there, with great fortified cities. It may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JS14_13' data-id='JS14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. </span>
<span class='v JS14_14' data-id='JS14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JS14_15' data-id='JS14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba. (Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.) And the land had rest from war. </span></div></div>
