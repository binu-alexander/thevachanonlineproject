<span class='v R115_1' data-id='R115_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>David built houses for himself in the city of David. And he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. </span>
<span class='v R115_2' data-id='R115_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, for the LORD had chosen them to carry the ark of the LORD and to minister to him forever. </span>
<span class='v R115_3' data-id='R115_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its place, which he had prepared for it. </span>

<span class='v R115_11' data-id='R115_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Am-minadab, </span>
<span class='v R115_12' data-id='R115_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites.

<span class='v R115_13' data-id='R115_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us, because we did not seek him according to the rule.” </span>
<span class='v R115_14' data-id='R115_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD, the God of Israel. </span>
