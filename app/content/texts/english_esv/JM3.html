<div class='s'>Taming the Tongue </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM3_1' data-id='JM3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. </span>
<span class='v JM3_2' data-id='JM3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For we all stumble in many ways, and if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. </span>
<span class='v JM3_3' data-id='JM3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. </span>
<span class='v JM3_4' data-id='JM3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. </span>
<span class='v JM3_5' data-id='JM3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM3_5' data-id='JM3_5'>How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire! </span>
<span class='v JM3_6' data-id='JM3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell. </span>
<span class='v JM3_7' data-id='JM3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind, </span>
<span class='v JM3_8' data-id='JM3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. </span>
<span class='v JM3_9' data-id='JM3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God. </span>
<span class='v JM3_10' data-id='JM3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. </span>
<span class='v JM3_11' data-id='JM3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water? </span>
<span class='v JM3_12' data-id='JM3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Wisdom from Above </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM3_13' data-id='JM3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom. </span>
<span class='v JM3_14' data-id='JM3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. </span>
<span class='v JM3_15' data-id='JM3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic. </span>
<span class='v JM3_16' data-id='JM3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. </span>
<span class='v JM3_17' data-id='JM3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. </span>
<span class='v JM3_18' data-id='JM3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace. </span></div></div>
