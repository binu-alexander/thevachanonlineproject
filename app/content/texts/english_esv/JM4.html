<div class='s'>Warning Against Worldliness </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM4_1' data-id='JM4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? </span>
<span class='v JM4_2' data-id='JM4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. </span>
<span class='v JM4_3' data-id='JM4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. </span>
<span class='v JM4_4' data-id='JM4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. </span>
<span class='v JM4_5' data-id='JM4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? </span>
<span class='v JM4_6' data-id='JM4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” </span>
<span class='v JM4_7' data-id='JM4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. </span>
<span class='v JM4_8' data-id='JM4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. </span>
<span class='v JM4_9' data-id='JM4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. </span>
<span class='v JM4_10' data-id='JM4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM4_11' data-id='JM4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. </span>
<span class='v JM4_12' data-id='JM4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor? </span></div>
<div class='s'>Boasting About Tomorrow </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM4_13' data-id='JM4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”— </span>
<span class='v JM4_14' data-id='JM4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. </span>
<span class='v JM4_15' data-id='JM4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” </span>
<span class='v JM4_16' data-id='JM4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. </span>
<span class='v JM4_17' data-id='JM4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin. </span></div></div>
