<div class='s'>Conspiracy Against Nehemiah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_1' data-id='NH6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem the Arab and the rest of our enemies heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates), </span>
<span class='v NH6_2' data-id='NH6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come and let us meet together at Hakkephirim in the plain of Ono.” But they intended to do me harm. </span>
<span class='v NH6_3' data-id='NH6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?” </span>
<span class='v NH6_4' data-id='NH6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they sent to me four times in this way, and I answered them in the same manner. </span>
<span class='v NH6_5' data-id='NH6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the same way Sanballat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand. </span>
<span class='v NH6_6' data-id='NH6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>In it was written, “It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall. And according to these reports you wish to become their king. </span>
<span class='v NH6_7' data-id='NH6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah.’ And now the king will hear of these reports. So now come and let us take counsel together.” </span>
<span class='v NH6_8' data-id='NH6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then I sent to him, saying, “No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind.” </span>
<span class='v NH6_9' data-id='NH6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” But now, O God, strengthen my hands. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_10' data-id='NH6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now when I went into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Me-hetabel, who was confined to his home, he said, “Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple. Let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. They are coming to kill you by night.” </span>
<span class='v NH6_11' data-id='NH6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But I said, “Should such a man as I run away? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.” </span>
<span class='v NH6_12' data-id='NH6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I understood and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. </span>
<span class='v NH6_13' data-id='NH6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me a bad name in order to taunt me. </span>
<span class='v NH6_14' data-id='NH6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Remember Tobiah and Sanballat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Wall Is Finished </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v NH6_15' data-id='NH6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days. </span>
<span class='v NH6_16' data-id='NH6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations around us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem, for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God. </span>
<span class='v NH6_17' data-id='NH6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Moreover, in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah's letters came to them. </span>
<span class='v NH6_18' data-id='NH6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah: and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as his wife. </span>
<span class='v NH6_19' data-id='NH6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to make me afraid. </span></div></div>
