<div class='s'>The Valley of Dry Bones </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_1' data-id='EK37_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The hand of the LORD was upon me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of the LORD and set me down in the middle of the valley; it was full of bones. </span>
<span class='v EK37_2' data-id='EK37_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry. </span>
<span class='v EK37_3' data-id='EK37_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.” </span>
<span class='v EK37_4' data-id='EK37_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v EK37_5' data-id='EK37_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. </span>
<span class='v EK37_6' data-id='EK37_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_7' data-id='EK37_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone. </span>
<span class='v EK37_8' data-id='EK37_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them. </span>
<span class='v EK37_9' data-id='EK37_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” </span>
<span class='v EK37_10' data-id='EK37_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_11' data-id='EK37_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then he said to me, “Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.’ </span>
<span class='v EK37_12' data-id='EK37_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v EK37_13' data-id='EK37_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. </span>
<span class='v EK37_14' data-id='EK37_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>I Will Be Their God, They Shall Be My People </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_15' data-id='EK37_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK37_16' data-id='EK37_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah, and the people of Israel associated with him’; then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph (the stick of Ephraim) and all the house of Israel associated with him.’ </span>
<span class='v EK37_17' data-id='EK37_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And join them one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand. </span>
<span class='v EK37_18' data-id='EK37_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And when your people say to you, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean by these?’ </span>
<span class='v EK37_19' data-id='EK37_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I am about to take the stick of Joseph (that is in the hand of Ephraim) and the tribes of Israel associated with him. And I will join with it the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, that they may be one in my hand. </span>
<span class='v EK37_20' data-id='EK37_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When the sticks on which you write are in your hand before their eyes, </span>
<span class='v EK37_21' data-id='EK37_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>then say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will take the people of Israel from the nations among which they have gone, and will gather them from all around, and bring them to their own land. </span>
<span class='v EK37_22' data-id='EK37_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. And one king shall be king over them all, and they shall be no longer two nations, and no longer divided into two kingdoms. </span>
<span class='v EK37_23' data-id='EK37_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols and their detestable things, or with any of their transgressions. But I will save them from all the backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK37_24' data-id='EK37_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>“My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd. They shall walk in my rules and be careful to obey my statutes. </span>
<span class='v EK37_25' data-id='EK37_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>They shall dwell in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob, where your fathers lived. They and their children and their children's children shall dwell there forever, and David my servant shall be their prince forever. </span>
<span class='v EK37_26' data-id='EK37_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will set them in their land and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore. </span>
<span class='v EK37_27' data-id='EK37_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. </span>
