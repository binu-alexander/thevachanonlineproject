<div class='s'>The Example of Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_1' data-id='RM15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. </span>
<span class='v RM15_2' data-id='RM15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up. </span>
<span class='v RM15_3' data-id='RM15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me.” </span>
<span class='v RM15_4' data-id='RM15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope. </span>
<span class='v RM15_5' data-id='RM15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v RM15_6' data-id='RM15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v RM15_7' data-id='RM15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Christ the Hope of Jews and Gentiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_8' data-id='RM15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, </span>
<span class='v RM15_9' data-id='RM15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_9' data-id='RM15_9'>“Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM15_9' data-id='RM15_9'>and sing to your name.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM15_10' data-id='RM15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And again it is said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_10' data-id='RM15_10'>“Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM15_11' data-id='RM15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And again, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_11' data-id='RM15_11'>“Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM15_11' data-id='RM15_11'>and let all the peoples extol him.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM15_12' data-id='RM15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And again Isaiah says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_12' data-id='RM15_12'>“The root of Jesse will come, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM15_12' data-id='RM15_12'>even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM15_12' data-id='RM15_12'>in him will the Gentiles hope.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM15_13' data-id='RM15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul the Minister to the Gentiles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_14' data-id='RM15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another. </span>
<span class='v RM15_15' data-id='RM15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God </span>
<span class='v RM15_16' data-id='RM15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v RM15_17' data-id='RM15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. </span>
<span class='v RM15_18' data-id='RM15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed, </span>
<span class='v RM15_19' data-id='RM15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God—so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ; </span>
<span class='v RM15_20' data-id='RM15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation, </span>
<span class='v RM15_21' data-id='RM15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM15_21' data-id='RM15_21'>“Those who have never been told of him will see, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM15_21' data-id='RM15_21'>and those who have never heard will understand.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul's Plan to Visit Rome </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_22' data-id='RM15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you. </span>
<span class='v RM15_23' data-id='RM15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you, </span>
<span class='v RM15_24' data-id='RM15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while. </span>
<span class='v RM15_25' data-id='RM15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints. </span>
<span class='v RM15_26' data-id='RM15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v RM15_27' data-id='RM15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings. </span>
<span class='v RM15_28' data-id='RM15_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you. </span>
<span class='v RM15_29' data-id='RM15_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM15_30' data-id='RM15_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf, </span>
<span class='v RM15_31' data-id='RM15_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, </span>
<span class='v RM15_32' data-id='RM15_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. </span>
<span class='v RM15_33' data-id='RM15_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>May the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </span></div></div>
