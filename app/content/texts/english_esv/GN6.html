<span class='v GN6_1' data-id='GN6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When man began to multiply on the face of the land and daughters were born to them, </span>
<span class='v GN6_2' data-id='GN6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>the sons of God saw that the daughters of man were attractive. And they took as their wives any they chose. </span>
<span class='v GN6_3' data-id='GN6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever, for he is flesh: his days shall be 120 years.” </span>
<span class='v GN6_4' data-id='GN6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of man and they bore children to them. These were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_5' data-id='GN6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. </span>
<span class='v GN6_6' data-id='GN6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the LORD was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart. </span>
<span class='v GN6_7' data-id='GN6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the LORD said, “I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.” </span>
<span class='v GN6_8' data-id='GN6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN6_9' data-id='GN6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation. Noah walked with God. </span>
<span class='v GN6_10' data-id='GN6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. </span></div>

<span class='v GN6_11' data-id='GN6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence. </span>
<span class='v GN6_12' data-id='GN6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_13' data-id='GN6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And God said to Noah, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I will destroy them with the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN6_14' data-id='GN6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Make yourself an ark of gopher wood. Make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch. </span>
<span class='v GN6_15' data-id='GN6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark 300 cubits, its breadth 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. </span>
<span class='v GN6_16' data-id='GN6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above, and set the door of the ark in its side. Make it with lower, second, and third decks. </span>
<span class='v GN6_17' data-id='GN6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For behold, I will bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which is the breath of life under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die. </span>
