<div class='s'>The Healing at the Pool on the Sabbath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_1' data-id='JN5_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_2' data-id='JN5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. </span>
<span class='v JN5_3' data-id='JN5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>In these lay a multitude of invalids—blind, lame, and paralyzed. </span>
<span class='v JN5_5' data-id='JN5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. </span>
<span class='v JN5_6' data-id='JN5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, “Do you want to be healed?” </span>
<span class='v JN5_7' data-id='JN5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.” </span>
<span class='v JN5_8' data-id='JN5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.” </span>
<span class='v JN5_9' data-id='JN5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_9' data-id='JN5_9'>Now that day was the Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v JN5_10' data-id='JN5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.” </span>
<span class='v JN5_11' data-id='JN5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’ ” </span>
<span class='v JN5_12' data-id='JN5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?” </span>
<span class='v JN5_13' data-id='JN5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place. </span>
<span class='v JN5_14' data-id='JN5_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, “See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse may happen to you.” </span>
<span class='v JN5_15' data-id='JN5_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him. </span>
<span class='v JN5_16' data-id='JN5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And this was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v JN5_17' data-id='JN5_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Equal with God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_18' data-id='JN5_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Authority of the Son </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_19' data-id='JN5_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does likewise. </span>
<span class='v JN5_20' data-id='JN5_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing. And greater works than these will he show him, so that you may marvel. </span>
<span class='v JN5_21' data-id='JN5_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will. </span>
<span class='v JN5_22' data-id='JN5_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, </span>
<span class='v JN5_23' data-id='JN5_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. </span>
<span class='v JN5_24' data-id='JN5_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_25' data-id='JN5_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. </span>
<span class='v JN5_26' data-id='JN5_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself. </span>
<span class='v JN5_27' data-id='JN5_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v JN5_28' data-id='JN5_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice </span>
<span class='v JN5_29' data-id='JN5_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>and come out, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Witnesses to Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN5_30' data-id='JN5_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“I can do nothing on my own. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me. </span>
<span class='v JN5_31' data-id='JN5_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>If I alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not deemed true. </span>
<span class='v JN5_32' data-id='JN5_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>There is another who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. </span>
<span class='v JN5_33' data-id='JN5_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth. </span>
<span class='v JN5_34' data-id='JN5_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved. </span>
<span class='v JN5_35' data-id='JN5_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. </span>
<span class='v JN5_36' data-id='JN5_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I am doing, bear witness about me that the Father has sent me. </span>
<span class='v JN5_37' data-id='JN5_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen, </span>
<span class='v JN5_38' data-id='JN5_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has sent. </span>
<span class='v JN5_39' data-id='JN5_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me, </span>
<span class='v JN5_40' data-id='JN5_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life. </span>
<span class='v JN5_41' data-id='JN5_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>I do not receive glory from people. </span>
<span class='v JN5_42' data-id='JN5_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>But I know that you do not have the love of God within you. </span>
<span class='v JN5_43' data-id='JN5_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him. </span>
<span class='v JN5_44' data-id='JN5_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God? </span>
<span class='v JN5_45' data-id='JN5_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you: Moses, on whom you have set your hope. </span>
<span class='v JN5_46' data-id='JN5_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>If you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. </span>
<span class='v JN5_47' data-id='JN5_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?” </span></div></div>
