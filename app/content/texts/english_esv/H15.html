<div class='s'>The Day of the Lord </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H15_1' data-id='H15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you. </span>
<span class='v H15_2' data-id='H15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. </span>
<span class='v H15_3' data-id='H15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. </span>
<span class='v H15_4' data-id='H15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. </span>
<span class='v H15_5' data-id='H15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness. </span>
<span class='v H15_6' data-id='H15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. </span>
<span class='v H15_7' data-id='H15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. </span>
<span class='v H15_8' data-id='H15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. </span>
<span class='v H15_9' data-id='H15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v H15_10' data-id='H15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him. </span>
<span class='v H15_11' data-id='H15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing. </span></div>

<span class='v H15_12' data-id='H15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, </span>
<span class='v H15_13' data-id='H15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves. </span>
<span class='v H15_14' data-id='H15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. </span>
<span class='v H15_15' data-id='H15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v H15_23' data-id='H15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v H15_24' data-id='H15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it. </span></div>
