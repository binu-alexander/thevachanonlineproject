<div class='s'>Righteousness Through Faith in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_1' data-id='PP3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_2' data-id='PP3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh. </span>
<span class='v PP3_3' data-id='PP3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For we are the real circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh— </span>
<span class='v PP3_4' data-id='PP3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more: </span>
<span class='v PP3_5' data-id='PP3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; </span>
<span class='v PP3_6' data-id='PP3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness, under the law blameless. </span>
<span class='v PP3_7' data-id='PP3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP3_8' data-id='PP3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ </span>
<span class='v PP3_9' data-id='PP3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith— </span>
<span class='v PP3_10' data-id='PP3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, </span>
<span class='v PP3_11' data-id='PP3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Straining Toward the Goal </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_12' data-id='PP3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own. </span>
<span class='v PP3_13' data-id='PP3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, </span>
<span class='v PP3_14' data-id='PP3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PP3_15' data-id='PP3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. </span>
<span class='v PP3_16' data-id='PP3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Only let us hold true to what we have attained. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP3_17' data-id='PP3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us. </span>
<span class='v PP3_18' data-id='PP3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP3_19' data-id='PP3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things. </span>
<span class='v PP3_20' data-id='PP3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP3_21' data-id='PP3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. </span></div></div>
