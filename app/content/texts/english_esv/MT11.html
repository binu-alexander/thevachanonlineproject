<div class='s'>Messengers from John the Baptist </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_1' data-id='MT11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_2' data-id='MT11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span> Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples </span>
<span class='v MT11_3' data-id='MT11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?” </span>
<span class='v MT11_4' data-id='MT11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “Go and tell John what you hear and see: </span>
<span class='v MT11_5' data-id='MT11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. </span>
<span class='v MT11_6' data-id='MT11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_7' data-id='MT11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? </span>
<span class='v MT11_8' data-id='MT11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. </span>
<span class='v MT11_9' data-id='MT11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. </span>
<span class='v MT11_10' data-id='MT11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This is he of whom it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT11_10' data-id='MT11_10'>“ ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT11_10' data-id='MT11_10'>who will prepare your way before you.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT11_11' data-id='MT11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. </span>
<span class='v MT11_12' data-id='MT11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. </span>
<span class='v MT11_13' data-id='MT11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, </span>
<span class='v MT11_14' data-id='MT11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. </span>
<span class='v MT11_15' data-id='MT11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He who has ears to hear, let him hear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_16' data-id='MT11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT11_17' data-id='MT11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“ ‘We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT11_17' data-id='MT11_17'>we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT11_18' data-id='MT11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ </span>
<span class='v MT11_19' data-id='MT11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Woe to Unrepentant Cities </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_20' data-id='MT11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. </span>
<span class='v MT11_21' data-id='MT11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span> “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. </span>
<span class='v MT11_22' data-id='MT11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. </span>
<span class='v MT11_23' data-id='MT11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. </span>
<span class='v MT11_24' data-id='MT11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Come to Me, and I Will Give You Rest </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT11_25' data-id='MT11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span> At that time Jesus declared, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; </span>
<span class='v MT11_26' data-id='MT11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. </span>
<span class='v MT11_27' data-id='MT11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. </span>
<span class='v MT11_28' data-id='MT11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </span>
<span class='v MT11_29' data-id='MT11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. </span>
<span class='v MT11_30' data-id='MT11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” </span></div></div>
