<span class='v EK25_2' data-id='EK25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, set your face toward the Ammonites and prophesy against them. </span>
<span class='v EK25_3' data-id='EK25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Because you said, ‘Aha!’ over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was made desolate, and over the house of Judah when they went into exile, </span>
<span class='v EK25_4' data-id='EK25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>therefore behold, I am handing you over to the people of the East for a possession, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings in your midst. They shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. </span>
<span class='v EK25_5' data-id='EK25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a fold for flocks. Then you will know that I am the LORD. </span>
<span class='v EK25_6' data-id='EK25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet and rejoiced with all the malice within your soul against the land of Israel, </span>
<span class='v EK25_7' data-id='EK25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I have stretched out my hand against you, and will hand you over as plunder to the nations.
