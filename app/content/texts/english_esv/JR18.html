<span class='v JR18_1' data-id='JR18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: </span>
<span class='v JR18_2' data-id='JR18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words.” </span>
<span class='v JR18_3' data-id='JR18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was working at his wheel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_4' data-id='JR18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand, and he reworked it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to do. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_5' data-id='JR18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v JR18_6' data-id='JR18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? declares the LORD. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_7' data-id='JR18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom, that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it, </span>
<span class='v JR18_8' data-id='JR18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it. </span>
<span class='v JR18_9' data-id='JR18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it, </span>
<span class='v JR18_10' data-id='JR18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it. </span>
<span class='v JR18_11' data-id='JR18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the LORD, behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return, every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<span class='v JR18_18' data-id='JR18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then they said, “Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.
