<div class='s'>Preparing to Build the Temple </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R22_1' data-id='R22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself. </span>
<span class='v R22_2' data-id='R22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Solomon assigned 70,000 men to bear burdens and 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 to oversee them. </span>
<span class='v R22_3' data-id='R22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Solomon sent word to Hiram the king of Tyre: “As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me. </span>
<span class='v R22_4' data-id='R22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of incense of sweet spices before him, and for the regular arrangement of the showbread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained forever for Israel. </span>
<span class='v R22_5' data-id='R22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The house that I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods. </span>
<span class='v R22_6' data-id='R22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to make offerings before him? </span>
<span class='v R22_7' data-id='R22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided. </span>
<span class='v R22_8' data-id='R22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants, </span>
<span class='v R22_9' data-id='R22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful. </span>
<span class='v R22_10' data-id='R22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I will give for your servants, the woodsmen who cut timber, 20,000 cors of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R22_11' data-id='R22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then Hiram the king of Tyre answered in a letter that he sent to Solomon, “Because the LORD loves his people, he has made you king over them.” </span>
<span class='v R22_12' data-id='R22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Hiram also said, “Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, who has discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R22_13' data-id='R22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Now I have sent a skilled man, who has understanding, Huram-abi, </span>
<span class='v R22_14' data-id='R22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father. </span>
<span class='v R22_15' data-id='R22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants. </span>
<span class='v R22_16' data-id='R22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R22_17' data-id='R22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon counted all the resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them that David his father had taken, and there were found 153,600. </span>
<span class='v R22_18' data-id='R22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 as overseers to make the people work. </span></div></div>
