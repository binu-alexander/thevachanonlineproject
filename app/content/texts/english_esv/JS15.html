<span class='v JS15_2' data-id='JS15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And their south boundary ran from the end of the Salt Sea, from the bay that faces southward. </span>

And the boundary passes along to the waters of En-shemesh and ends at En-rogel. </span>
<span class='v JS15_8' data-id='JS15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the boundary goes up by the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the southern shoulder of the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem).

<span class='v JS15_12' data-id='JS15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the west boundary was the Great Sea with its coastline. This is the boundary around the people of Judah according to their clans. </span></div>
