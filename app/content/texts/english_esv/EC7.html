<div class='s'>The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_1' data-id='EC7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>A good name is better than precious ointment, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_1' data-id='EC7_1'>and the day of death than the day of birth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_2' data-id='EC7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It is better to go to the house of mourning </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_2' data-id='EC7_2'>than to go to the house of feasting, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_2' data-id='EC7_2'>for this is the end of all mankind, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_2' data-id='EC7_2'>and the living will lay it to heart. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_3' data-id='EC7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Sorrow is better than laughter, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_3' data-id='EC7_3'>for by sadness of face the heart is made glad. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_4' data-id='EC7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_4' data-id='EC7_4'>but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_5' data-id='EC7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_5' data-id='EC7_5'>than to hear the song of fools. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_6' data-id='EC7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_6' data-id='EC7_6'>so is the laughter of the fools; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_6' data-id='EC7_6'>this also is vanity. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_7' data-id='EC7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Surely oppression drives the wise into madness, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_7' data-id='EC7_7'>and a bribe corrupts the heart. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_8' data-id='EC7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_8' data-id='EC7_8'>and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_9' data-id='EC7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Be not quick in your spirit to become angry, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_9' data-id='EC7_9'>for anger lodges in the bosom of fools. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_10' data-id='EC7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_10' data-id='EC7_10'>For it is not from wisdom that you ask this. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_11' data-id='EC7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Wisdom is good with an inheritance, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_11' data-id='EC7_11'>an advantage to those who see the sun. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_12' data-id='EC7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the protection of wisdom is like the protection of money, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_12' data-id='EC7_12'>and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EC7_13' data-id='EC7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Consider the work of God: </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EC7_13' data-id='EC7_13'>who can make straight what he has made crooked? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_14' data-id='EC7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, so that man may not find out anything that will be after him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_15' data-id='EC7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>In my vain life I have seen everything. There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his evildoing. </span>
<span class='v EC7_16' data-id='EC7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be not overly righ teous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself? </span>
<span class='v EC7_17' data-id='EC7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. Why should you die before your time? </span>
<span class='v EC7_18' data-id='EC7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It is good that you should take hold of this, and from that withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_19' data-id='EC7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_20' data-id='EC7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Surely there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_21' data-id='EC7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear your servant cursing you. </span>
<span class='v EC7_22' data-id='EC7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Your heart knows that many times you have yourself cursed others. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_23' data-id='EC7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>All this I have tested by wisdom. I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me. </span>
<span class='v EC7_24' data-id='EC7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>That which has been is far off, and deep, very deep; who can find it out? </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC7_25' data-id='EC7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness. </span>
<span class='v EC7_26' data-id='EC7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And I find something more bitter than death: the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is taken by her. </span>
<span class='v EC7_27' data-id='EC7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Behold, this is what I found, says the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things— </span>
<span class='v EC7_28' data-id='EC7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. One man among a thousand I found, but a woman among all these I have not found. </span>
<span class='v EC7_29' data-id='EC7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes. </span></div></div>
