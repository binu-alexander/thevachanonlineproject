<div class='s'>The Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_1' data-id='MT28_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. </span>
<span class='v MT28_2' data-id='MT28_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. </span>
<span class='v MT28_3' data-id='MT28_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. </span>
<span class='v MT28_4' data-id='MT28_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. </span>
<span class='v MT28_5' data-id='MT28_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. </span>
<span class='v MT28_6' data-id='MT28_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. </span>
<span class='v MT28_7' data-id='MT28_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_8' data-id='MT28_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. </span>
<span class='v MT28_9' data-id='MT28_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And behold, Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. </span>
<span class='v MT28_10' data-id='MT28_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Report of the Guard </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_11' data-id='MT28_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. </span>
<span class='v MT28_12' data-id='MT28_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers </span>
<span class='v MT28_13' data-id='MT28_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and said, “Tell people, ‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’ </span>
<span class='v MT28_14' data-id='MT28_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.” </span>
<span class='v MT28_15' data-id='MT28_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Great Commission </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT28_16' data-id='MT28_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. </span>
<span class='v MT28_17' data-id='MT28_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. </span>
<span class='v MT28_18' data-id='MT28_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Jesus came and said to them, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. </span>
<span class='v MT28_19' data-id='MT28_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v MT28_20' data-id='MT28_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” </span></div></div>
