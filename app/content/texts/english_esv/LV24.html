<span class='v LV24_7' data-id='LV24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And you shall put pure frankincense on each pile, that it may go with the bread as a memorial portion as a food offering to the LORD. </span>
<span class='v LV24_8' data-id='LV24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange it before the LORD regularly; it is from the people of Israel as a covenant forever. </span>
<span class='v LV24_9' data-id='LV24_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a holy place, since it is for him a most holy portion out of the LORD's food offerings, a perpetual due.” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV24_10' data-id='LV24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now an Israelite woman's son, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the people of Israel. And the Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel fought in the camp, </span>
<span class='v LV24_11' data-id='LV24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name, and cursed. Then they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV24_13' data-id='LV24_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </span>
<span class='v LV24_14' data-id='LV24_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Bring out of the camp the one who cursed, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him. </span>
<span class='v LV24_15' data-id='LV24_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin. </span>
<span class='v LV24_16' data-id='LV24_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death. </span></div>
