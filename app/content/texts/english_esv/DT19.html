<span class='v DT19_2' data-id='DT19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>you shall set apart three cities for yourselves in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to possess. </span>
<span class='v DT19_3' data-id='DT19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You shall measure the distances and divide into three parts the area of the land that the LORD your God gives you as a possession, so that any manslayer can flee to them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT19_4' data-id='DT19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“This is the provision for the manslayer, who by fleeing there may save his life. If anyone kills his neighbor unintentionally without having hated him in the past— </span>
<span class='v DT19_5' data-id='DT19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>as when someone goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down a tree, and the head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbor so that he dies—he may flee to one of these cities and live, </span>
<span class='v DT19_6' data-id='DT19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>lest the avenger of blood in hot anger pursue the manslayer and overtake him, because the way is long, and strike him fatally, though the man did not deserve to die, since he had not hated his neighbor in the past. </span>
<span class='v DT19_7' data-id='DT19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore I command you, You shall set apart three cities. </span>
<span class='v DT19_8' data-id='DT19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has sworn to your fathers, and gives you all the land that he promised to give to your fathers— </span>
<span class='v DT19_9' data-id='DT19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>provided you are careful to keep all this commandment, which I command you today, by loving the LORD your God and by walking ever in his ways—then you shall add three other cities to these three, </span>
<span class='v DT19_10' data-id='DT19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>lest innocent blood be shed in your land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance, and so the guilt of bloodshed be upon you. </span></div>

<span class='v DT19_11' data-id='DT19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“But if anyone hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him and attacks him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and he flees into one of these cities, </span>
<span class='v DT19_12' data-id='DT19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die. </span>

<span class='v DT19_18' data-id='DT19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The judges shall inquire diligently, and if the witness is a false witness and has accused his brother falsely, </span>
<span class='v DT19_19' data-id='DT19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>then you shall do to him as he had meant to do to his brother. So you shall purge the evil from your midst. </span>
<span class='v DT19_20' data-id='DT19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the rest shall hear and fear, and shall never again commit any such evil among you. </span>
