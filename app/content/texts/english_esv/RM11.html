<div class='s'>The Remnant of Israel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_1' data-id='RM11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. </span>
<span class='v RM11_2' data-id='RM11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel? </span>
<span class='v RM11_3' data-id='RM11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span> “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.” </span>
<span class='v RM11_4' data-id='RM11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But what is God's reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” </span>
<span class='v RM11_5' data-id='RM11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. </span>
<span class='v RM11_6' data-id='RM11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_7' data-id='RM11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened, </span>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>“God gave them a spirit of stupor, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>eyes that would not see </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>and ears that would not hear, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_8' data-id='RM11_8'>down to this very day.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And David says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'>“Let their table become a snare and a trap, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_9' data-id='RM11_9'>a stumbling block and a retribution for them; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_10' data-id='RM11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_10' data-id='RM11_10'>and bend their backs forever.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Gentiles Grafted In </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_11' data-id='RM11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. </span>
<span class='v RM11_12' data-id='RM11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean! </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_13' data-id='RM11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry </span>
<span class='v RM11_14' data-id='RM11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. </span>
<span class='v RM11_15' data-id='RM11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead? </span>
<span class='v RM11_16' data-id='RM11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_17' data-id='RM11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, </span>
<span class='v RM11_18' data-id='RM11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. </span>
<span class='v RM11_19' data-id='RM11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.” </span>
<span class='v RM11_20' data-id='RM11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but stand in awe. </span>
<span class='v RM11_21' data-id='RM11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. </span>
<span class='v RM11_22' data-id='RM11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. </span>
<span class='v RM11_23' data-id='RM11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again. </span>
<span class='v RM11_24' data-id='RM11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Mystery of Israel's Salvation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_25' data-id='RM11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Lest you be wise in your own conceits, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. </span>
<span class='v RM11_26' data-id='RM11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_26' data-id='RM11_26'>“The Deliverer will come from Zion, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_26' data-id='RM11_26'>he will banish ungodliness from Jacob”; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_27' data-id='RM11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“and this will be my covenant with them </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_27' data-id='RM11_27'>when I take away their sins.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM11_28' data-id='RM11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers. </span>
<span class='v RM11_29' data-id='RM11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable. </span>
<span class='v RM11_30' data-id='RM11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience, </span>
<span class='v RM11_31' data-id='RM11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy. </span>
<span class='v RM11_32' data-id='RM11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM11_33' data-id='RM11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_34' data-id='RM11_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>“For who has known the mind of the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_34' data-id='RM11_34'>or who has been his counselor?” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM11_35' data-id='RM11_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“Or who has given a gift to him </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM11_35' data-id='RM11_35'>that he might be repaid?” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM11_36' data-id='RM11_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen. </span></div></div>
