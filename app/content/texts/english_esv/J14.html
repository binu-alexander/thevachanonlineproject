<div class='s'>Test the Spirits </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_1' data-id='J14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_2' data-id='J14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, </span>
<span class='v J14_3' data-id='J14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. </span>
<span class='v J14_4' data-id='J14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_5' data-id='J14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. </span>
<span class='v J14_6' data-id='J14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God Is Love </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_7' data-id='J14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. </span>
<span class='v J14_8' data-id='J14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. </span>
<span class='v J14_9' data-id='J14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. </span>
<span class='v J14_10' data-id='J14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. </span>
<span class='v J14_11' data-id='J14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. </span>
<span class='v J14_12' data-id='J14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v J14_13' data-id='J14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. </span>
<span class='v J14_14' data-id='J14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. </span>
<span class='v J14_15' data-id='J14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. </span>
<span class='v J14_16' data-id='J14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. </span>
<span class='v J14_17' data-id='J14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world. </span>
<span class='v J14_18' data-id='J14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love. </span>
<span class='v J14_19' data-id='J14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>We love because he first loved us. </span>
<span class='v J14_20' data-id='J14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>If anyone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen. </span>
<span class='v J14_21' data-id='J14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother. </span></div></div>
