<span class='v NH1_1' data-id='NH1_1'>Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital, </span>
<span class='v NH1_2' data-id='NH1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came with certain men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who escaped, who had survived the exile, and concerning Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v NH1_3' data-id='NH1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they said to me, “The remnant there in the province who had survived the exile is in great trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire.” </span></div>

<span class='v NH1_4' data-id='NH1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As soon as I heard these words I sat down and wept and mourned for days, and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven. </span>
<span class='v NH1_5' data-id='NH1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I said, “O LORD God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments, </span>
<span class='v NH1_6' data-id='NH1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to hear the prayer of your servant that I now pray before you day and night for the people of Israel your servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Even I and my father's house have sinned. </span>
<span class='v NH1_7' data-id='NH1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>We have acted very corruptly against you and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the rules that you commanded your servant Moses. </span>
<span class='v NH1_8' data-id='NH1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Remember the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples, </span>
<span class='v NH1_9' data-id='NH1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place that I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.’ </span>
<span class='v NH1_10' data-id='NH1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand. </span>
