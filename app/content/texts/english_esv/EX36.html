<span class='v EX36_1' data-id='EX36_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whom the LORD has put skill and intelligence to know how to do any work in the construction of the sanctuary shall work in accordance with all that the LORD has commanded.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_2' data-id='EX36_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every craftsman in whose mind the LORD had put skill, everyone whose heart stirred him up to come to do the work. </span>
<span class='v EX36_3' data-id='EX36_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they received from Moses all the contribution that the people of Israel had brought for doing the work on the sanctuary. They still kept bringing him freewill offerings every morning, </span>
<span class='v EX36_4' data-id='EX36_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>so that all the craftsmen who were doing every sort of task on the sanctuary came, each from the task that he was doing, </span>
<span class='v EX36_5' data-id='EX36_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and said to Moses, “The people bring much more than enough for doing the work that the LORD has commanded us to do.” </span>
<span class='v EX36_6' data-id='EX36_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So Moses gave command, and word was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let no man or woman do anything more for the contribution for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing, </span>
<span class='v EX36_7' data-id='EX36_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>for the material they had was sufficient to do all the work, and more. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_8' data-id='EX36_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And all the craftsmen among the workmen made the tabernacle with ten curtains. They were made of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet yarns, with cherubim skillfully worked. </span>
<span class='v EX36_9' data-id='EX36_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits. All the curtains were the same size. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_10' data-id='EX36_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five curtains he coupled to one another. </span>
<span class='v EX36_11' data-id='EX36_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain of the first set. Likewise he made them on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set. </span>
<span class='v EX36_12' data-id='EX36_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He made fifty loops on the one curtain, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was in the second set. The loops were opposite one another. </span>
<span class='v EX36_13' data-id='EX36_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to the other with clasps. So the tabernacle was a single whole. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_14' data-id='EX36_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He also made curtains of goats' hair for a tent over the tabernacle. He made eleven curtains. </span>

<span class='v EX36_17' data-id='EX36_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the one set, and fifty loops on the edge of the other connecting curtain. </span>
<span class='v EX36_18' data-id='EX36_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he made fifty clasps of bronze to couple the tent together that it might be a single whole. </span>
<span class='v EX36_19' data-id='EX36_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he made for the tent a covering of tanned rams' skins and goatskins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_20' data-id='EX36_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he made the upright frames for the tabernacle of acacia wood. </span>

<span class='v EX36_22' data-id='EX36_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Each frame had two tenons for fitting together. He did this for all the frames of the tabernacle. </span>

<span class='v EX36_28' data-id='EX36_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>He made two frames for corners of the tabernacle in the rear. </span>
<span class='v EX36_29' data-id='EX36_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And they were separate beneath but joined at the top, at the first ring. He made two of them this way for the two corners. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX36_31' data-id='EX36_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He made bars of acacia wood, five for the frames of the one side of the tabernacle, </span>

<span class='v EX36_33' data-id='EX36_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he made the middle bar to run from end to end halfway up the frames. </span>
<span class='v EX36_34' data-id='EX36_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And he overlaid the frames with gold, and made their rings of gold for holders for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold. </span></div>
