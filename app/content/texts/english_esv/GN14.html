<span class='v GN14_1' data-id='GN14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, </span>
<span class='v GN14_2' data-id='GN14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>these kings made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). </span>
<span class='v GN14_3' data-id='GN14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And all these joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). </span>
<span class='v GN14_4' data-id='GN14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. </span>
<span class='v GN14_5' data-id='GN14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, </span>
<span class='v GN14_6' data-id='GN14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and the Horites in their hill country of Seir as far as El-paran on the border of the wilderness. </span>
<span class='v GN14_7' data-id='GN14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh) and defeated all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who were dwelling in Hazazon-tamar. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN14_8' data-id='GN14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out, and they joined battle in the Valley of Siddim </span>
<span class='v GN14_9' data-id='GN14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five. </span>
<span class='v GN14_10' data-id='GN14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now the Valley of Siddim was full of bitumen pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hill country. </span>
<span class='v GN14_11' data-id='GN14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>So the enemy took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their provisions, and went their way. </span>
<span class='v GN14_12' data-id='GN14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>They also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, who was dwelling in Sodom, and his possessions, and went their way. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN14_13' data-id='GN14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then one who had escaped came and told Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and of Aner. These were allies of Abram. </span>
<span class='v GN14_14' data-id='GN14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of them, and went in pursuit as far as Dan. </span>
<span class='v GN14_15' data-id='GN14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. </span>
<span class='v GN14_16' data-id='GN14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then he brought back all the possessions, and also brought back his kinsman Lot with his possessions, and the women and the people. </span></div>

<span class='v GN14_17' data-id='GN14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>After his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley). </span>
<span class='v GN14_18' data-id='GN14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High.) </span>
<span class='v GN14_19' data-id='GN14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he blessed him and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN14_19' data-id='GN14_19'>“Blessed be Abram by God Most High, </span></div>
<div class='q'>

<span class='v GN14_20' data-id='GN14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>and blessed be God Most High, </span></div>

<div class='m'>
<span class='v GN14_20' data-id='GN14_20'>And Abram gave him a tenth of everything. </span>
<span class='v GN14_21' data-id='GN14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the persons, but take the goods for yourself.” </span>
<span class='v GN14_22' data-id='GN14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have lifted my hand to the LORD, God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, </span>
<span class='v GN14_23' data-id='GN14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>that I would not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, lest you should say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ </span>
<span class='v GN14_24' data-id='GN14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>I will take nothing but what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me. Let Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre take their share.” </span></div></div>
