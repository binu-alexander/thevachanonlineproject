<div class='s'>Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_1' data-id='JN12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Six days before the Passover, Jesus therefore came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_2' data-id='JN12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So they gave a dinner for him there. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at the table. </span>
<span class='v JN12_3' data-id='JN12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Mary therefore took a pound of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. </span>
<span class='v JN12_4' data-id='JN12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said, </span>
<span class='v JN12_5' data-id='JN12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?” </span>
<span class='v JN12_6' data-id='JN12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it. </span>
<span class='v JN12_7' data-id='JN12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my burial. </span>
<span class='v JN12_8' data-id='JN12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plot to Kill Lazarus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_9' data-id='JN12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_10' data-id='JN12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well, </span>
<span class='v JN12_11' data-id='JN12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Triumphal Entry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_12' data-id='JN12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JN12_13' data-id='JN12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” </span>
<span class='v JN12_14' data-id='JN12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN12_15' data-id='JN12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> “Fear not, daughter of Zion; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN12_15' data-id='JN12_15'>behold, your king is coming, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN12_15' data-id='JN12_15'>sitting on a donkey's colt!” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN12_16' data-id='JN12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_17' data-id='JN12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness. </span>
<span class='v JN12_18' data-id='JN12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. </span>
<span class='v JN12_19' data-id='JN12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, the world has gone after him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Some Greeks Seek Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_20' data-id='JN12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks. </span>
<span class='v JN12_21' data-id='JN12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So these came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_22' data-id='JN12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN12_23' data-id='JN12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span>
<span class='v JN12_24' data-id='JN12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. </span>
<span class='v JN12_25' data-id='JN12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Whoever loves his life loses it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. </span>
<span class='v JN12_26' data-id='JN12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there will my servant be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Son of Man Must Be Lifted Up </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_27' data-id='JN12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>“Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But for this purpose I have come to this hour. </span>
<span class='v JN12_28' data-id='JN12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven: “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_29' data-id='JN12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_30' data-id='JN12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not mine. </span>
<span class='v JN12_31' data-id='JN12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Now is the judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be cast out. </span>
<span class='v JN12_32' data-id='JN12_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_33' data-id='JN12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die. </span>
<span class='v JN12_34' data-id='JN12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever. How can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?” </span>
<span class='v JN12_35' data-id='JN12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>So Jesus said to them, “The light is among you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. </span>
<span class='v JN12_36' data-id='JN12_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v JN12_36' data-id='JN12_36'>The Unbelief of the People </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_36' data-id='JN12_36'>When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. </span>
<span class='v JN12_37' data-id='JN12_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, </span>
<span class='v JN12_38' data-id='JN12_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN12_38' data-id='JN12_38'>“Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN12_38' data-id='JN12_38'>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN12_39' data-id='JN12_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN12_40' data-id='JN12_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span> “He has blinded their eyes </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN12_40' data-id='JN12_40'>and hardened their heart, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JN12_40' data-id='JN12_40'>lest they see with their eyes, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN12_40' data-id='JN12_40'>and understand with their heart, and turn, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JN12_40' data-id='JN12_40'>and I would heal them.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v JN12_41' data-id='JN12_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke of him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_42' data-id='JN12_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue; </span>
<span class='v JN12_43' data-id='JN12_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>for they loved the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Came to Save the World </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_44' data-id='JN12_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me. </span>
<span class='v JN12_45' data-id='JN12_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And whoever sees me sees him who sent me. </span>
<span class='v JN12_46' data-id='JN12_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>I have come into the world as light, so that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. </span>
<span class='v JN12_47' data-id='JN12_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. </span>
<span class='v JN12_48' data-id='JN12_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. </span>
<span class='v JN12_49' data-id='JN12_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>For I have not spoken on my own authority, but the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment—what to say and what to speak. </span>
<span class='v JN12_50' data-id='JN12_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has told me.” </span></div></div>
