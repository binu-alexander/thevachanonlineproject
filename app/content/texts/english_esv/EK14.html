<span class='v EK14_2' data-id='EK14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK14_3' data-id='EK14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their hearts, and set the stumbling block of their iniquity before their faces. Should I indeed let myself be consulted by them? </span>
<span class='v EK14_4' data-id='EK14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Therefore speak to them and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Any one of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart and sets the stumbling block of his iniquity before his face, and yet comes to the prophet, I the LORD will answer him as he comes with the multitude of his idols, </span>
<span class='v EK14_5' data-id='EK14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>that I may lay hold of the hearts of the house of Israel, who are all estranged from me through their idols. </span></div>
