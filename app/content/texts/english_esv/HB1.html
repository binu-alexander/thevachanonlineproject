<span class='v HB1_2' data-id='HB1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. </span>

After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, </span>
<span class='v HB1_4' data-id='HB1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs. </span></div>
