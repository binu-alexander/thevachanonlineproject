<div class='s'>The Throne in Heaven </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV4_1' data-id='RV4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.” </span>
<span class='v RV4_2' data-id='RV4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. </span>
<span class='v RV4_3' data-id='RV4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald. </span>
<span class='v RV4_4' data-id='RV4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads. </span>
<span class='v RV4_5' data-id='RV4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God, </span>
<span class='v RV4_6' data-id='RV4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV4_6' data-id='RV4_6'>And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: </span>
<span class='v RV4_7' data-id='RV4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight. </span>
<span class='v RV4_8' data-id='RV4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV4_8' data-id='RV4_8'>“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV4_8' data-id='RV4_8'>who was and is and is to come!” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV4_9' data-id='RV4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, </span>
<span class='v RV4_10' data-id='RV4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV4_11' data-id='RV4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Worthy are you, our Lord and God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV4_11' data-id='RV4_11'>to receive glory and honor and power, </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV4_11' data-id='RV4_11'>and by your will they existed and were created.” </span></div></div>
