<div class='s'>Bear One Another's Burdens </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_1' data-id='GL6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. </span>
<span class='v GL6_2' data-id='GL6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL6_3' data-id='GL6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself. </span>
<span class='v GL6_4' data-id='GL6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor. </span>
<span class='v GL6_5' data-id='GL6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For each will have to bear his own load. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_6' data-id='GL6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches. </span>
<span class='v GL6_7' data-id='GL6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap. </span>
<span class='v GL6_8' data-id='GL6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. </span>
<span class='v GL6_9' data-id='GL6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. </span>
<span class='v GL6_10' data-id='GL6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Warning and Benediction </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_11' data-id='GL6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand. </span>
<span class='v GL6_12' data-id='GL6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL6_13' data-id='GL6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh. </span>
<span class='v GL6_14' data-id='GL6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world. </span>
<span class='v GL6_15' data-id='GL6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. </span>
<span class='v GL6_16' data-id='GL6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_17' data-id='GL6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL6_18' data-id='GL6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. </span></div></div>
