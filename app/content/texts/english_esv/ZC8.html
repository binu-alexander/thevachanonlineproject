<div class='s'>The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_1' data-id='ZC8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD of hosts came, saying, </span>
<span class='v ZC8_2' data-id='ZC8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_3' data-id='ZC8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD: I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the LORD of hosts, the holy mountain. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_4' data-id='ZC8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD of hosts: Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_5' data-id='ZC8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_6' data-id='ZC8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD of hosts: If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the LORD of hosts? </span>
<span class='v ZC8_7' data-id='ZC8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD of hosts: behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, </span>
<span class='v ZC8_8' data-id='ZC8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_9' data-id='ZC8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD of hosts: “Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_10' data-id='ZC8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_11' data-id='ZC8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the LORD of hosts. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_12' data-id='ZC8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_13' data-id='ZC8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_14' data-id='ZC8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For thus says the LORD of hosts: “As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the LORD of hosts, </span>
<span class='v ZC8_15' data-id='ZC8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_16' data-id='ZC8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>These are the things that you shall do: Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace; </span>
<span class='v ZC8_17' data-id='ZC8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_18' data-id='ZC8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v ZC8_19' data-id='ZC8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC8_20' data-id='ZC8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD of hosts: Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_21' data-id='ZC8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the LORD and to seek the LORD of hosts; I myself am going.’ </span>
<span class='v ZC8_22' data-id='ZC8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v ZC8_23' data-id='ZC8_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD of hosts: In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, ‘Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.’ ” </span></div></div>
