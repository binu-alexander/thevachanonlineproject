<div class='s'>Samuel's Farewell Address </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_1' data-id='S112_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have obeyed your voice in all that you have said to me and have made a king over you. </span>
<span class='v S112_2' data-id='S112_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And now, behold, the king walks before you, and I am old and gray; and behold, my sons are with you. I have walked before you from my youth until this day. </span>
<span class='v S112_3' data-id='S112_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me and I will restore it to you.” </span>
<span class='v S112_4' data-id='S112_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>They said, “You have not defrauded us or oppressed us or taken anything from any man's hand.” </span>
<span class='v S112_5' data-id='S112_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they said, “He is witness.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_6' data-id='S112_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to the people, “The LORD is witness, who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. </span>
<span class='v S112_7' data-id='S112_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now therefore stand still that I may plead with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous deeds of the LORD that he performed for you and for your fathers. </span>
<span class='v S112_8' data-id='S112_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Jacob went into Egypt, and the Egyptians oppressed them, then your fathers cried out to the LORD and the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your fathers out of Egypt and made them dwell in this place. </span>
<span class='v S112_9' data-id='S112_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But they forgot the LORD their God. And he sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab. And they fought against them. </span>
<span class='v S112_10' data-id='S112_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And they cried out to the LORD and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. But now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, that we may serve you.’ </span>
<span class='v S112_11' data-id='S112_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the LORD sent Jerubbaal and Barak and Jephthah and Samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in safety. </span>
<span class='v S112_12' data-id='S112_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us,’ when the LORD your God was your king. </span>
<span class='v S112_13' data-id='S112_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And now behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you. </span>
<span class='v S112_14' data-id='S112_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If you will fear the LORD and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, and if both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the LORD your God, it will be well. </span>
<span class='v S112_15' data-id='S112_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then the hand of the LORD will be against you and your king. </span>
<span class='v S112_16' data-id='S112_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing that the LORD will do before your eyes. </span>
<span class='v S112_17' data-id='S112_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the LORD, that he may send thunder and rain. And you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking for yourselves a king.” </span>
<span class='v S112_18' data-id='S112_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Samuel called upon the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S112_19' data-id='S112_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we may not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.” </span>
<span class='v S112_20' data-id='S112_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid; you have done all this evil. Yet do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. </span>
<span class='v S112_21' data-id='S112_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And do not turn aside after empty things that cannot profit or deliver, for they are empty. </span>
<span class='v S112_22' data-id='S112_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For the LORD will not forsake his people, for his great name's sake, because it has pleased the LORD to make you a people for himself. </span>
<span class='v S112_23' data-id='S112_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you, and I will instruct you in the good and the right way. </span>
<span class='v S112_24' data-id='S112_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you. </span>
<span class='v S112_25' data-id='S112_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.” </span></div></div>
