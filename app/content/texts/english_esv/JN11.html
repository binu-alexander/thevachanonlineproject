<div class='s'>The Death of Lazarus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_1' data-id='JN11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. </span>
<span class='v JN11_2' data-id='JN11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill. </span>
<span class='v JN11_3' data-id='JN11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, he whom you love is ill.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_4' data-id='JN11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But when Jesus heard it he said, “This illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_5' data-id='JN11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. </span>
<span class='v JN11_6' data-id='JN11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was. </span>
<span class='v JN11_7' data-id='JN11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then after this he said to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_8' data-id='JN11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_9' data-id='JN11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. </span>
<span class='v JN11_10' data-id='JN11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_11' data-id='JN11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>After saying these things, he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_12' data-id='JN11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_13' data-id='JN11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep. </span>
<span class='v JN11_14' data-id='JN11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, </span>
<span class='v JN11_15' data-id='JN11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_16' data-id='JN11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, that we may die with him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>I Am the Resurrection and the Life </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_17' data-id='JN11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb four days. </span>
<span class='v JN11_18' data-id='JN11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off, </span>
<span class='v JN11_19' data-id='JN11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother. </span>
<span class='v JN11_20' data-id='JN11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house. </span>
<span class='v JN11_21' data-id='JN11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. </span>
<span class='v JN11_22' data-id='JN11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_23' data-id='JN11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_24' data-id='JN11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_25' data-id='JN11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, </span>
<span class='v JN11_26' data-id='JN11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_27' data-id='JN11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>She said to him, “Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Wept </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_28' data-id='JN11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_29' data-id='JN11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him. </span>
<span class='v JN11_30' data-id='JN11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him. </span>
<span class='v JN11_31' data-id='JN11_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there. </span>
<span class='v JN11_32' data-id='JN11_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_33' data-id='JN11_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in his spirit and greatly troubled. </span>
<span class='v JN11_34' data-id='JN11_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_35' data-id='JN11_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus wept. </span>
<span class='v JN11_36' data-id='JN11_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>So the Jews said, “See how he loved him!” </span>
<span class='v JN11_37' data-id='JN11_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But some of them said, “Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man also have kept this man from dying?” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Raises Lazarus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_38' data-id='JN11_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it. </span>
<span class='v JN11_39' data-id='JN11_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_40' data-id='JN11_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of God?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_41' data-id='JN11_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you have heard me. </span>
<span class='v JN11_42' data-id='JN11_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this on account of the people standing around, that they may believe that you sent me.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_43' data-id='JN11_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_44' data-id='JN11_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>The man who had died came out, his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, and let him go.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Plot to Kill Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_45' data-id='JN11_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him, </span>
<span class='v JN11_46' data-id='JN11_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. </span>
<span class='v JN11_47' data-id='JN11_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Council and said, “What are we to do? For this man performs many signs. </span>
<span class='v JN11_48' data-id='JN11_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_49' data-id='JN11_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all. </span>
<span class='v JN11_50' data-id='JN11_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>Nor do you understand that it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.” </span>
<span class='v JN11_51' data-id='JN11_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, </span>
<span class='v JN11_52' data-id='JN11_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad. </span>
<span class='v JN11_53' data-id='JN11_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>So from that day on they made plans to put him to death. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_54' data-id='JN11_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN11_55' data-id='JN11_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves. </span>
<span class='v JN11_56' data-id='JN11_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?” </span>
<span class='v JN11_57' data-id='JN11_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him. </span></div></div>
