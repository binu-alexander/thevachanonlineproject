<div class='s'>Our Heavenly Dwelling </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C25_1' data-id='C25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For we know that if the tent, which is our earthly home, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. </span>
<span class='v C25_2' data-id='C25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling, </span>
<span class='v C25_3' data-id='C25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked. </span>
<span class='v C25_4' data-id='C25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened—not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. </span>
<span class='v C25_5' data-id='C25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C25_6' data-id='C25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord, </span>
<span class='v C25_7' data-id='C25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>for we walk by faith, not by sight. </span>
<span class='v C25_8' data-id='C25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord. </span>
<span class='v C25_9' data-id='C25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him. </span>
<span class='v C25_10' data-id='C25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ministry of Reconciliation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C25_11' data-id='C25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience. </span>
<span class='v C25_12' data-id='C25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart. </span>
<span class='v C25_13' data-id='C25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you. </span>
<span class='v C25_14' data-id='C25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died; </span>
<span class='v C25_15' data-id='C25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C25_16' data-id='C25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer. </span>
<span class='v C25_17' data-id='C25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. </span>
<span class='v C25_18' data-id='C25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; </span>
<span class='v C25_19' data-id='C25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation. </span>
<span class='v C25_20' data-id='C25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. </span>
<span class='v C25_21' data-id='C25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. </span></div></div>
