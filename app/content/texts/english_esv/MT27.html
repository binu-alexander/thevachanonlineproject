<div class='s'>Jesus Delivered to Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_1' data-id='MT27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. </span>
<span class='v MT27_2' data-id='MT27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Judas Hangs Himself </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_3' data-id='MT27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, </span>
<span class='v MT27_4' data-id='MT27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_5' data-id='MT27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. </span>
<span class='v MT27_6' data-id='MT27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_7' data-id='MT27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. </span>
<span class='v MT27_8' data-id='MT27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. </span>
<span class='v MT27_9' data-id='MT27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, </span>
<span class='v MT27_10' data-id='MT27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Before Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_11' data-id='MT27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You have said so.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_12' data-id='MT27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. </span>
<span class='v MT27_13' data-id='MT27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_14' data-id='MT27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crowd Chooses Barabbas </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_15' data-id='MT27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. </span>
<span class='v MT27_16' data-id='MT27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. </span>
<span class='v MT27_17' data-id='MT27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_18' data-id='MT27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. </span>
<span class='v MT27_19' data-id='MT27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_20' data-id='MT27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_21' data-id='MT27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_22' data-id='MT27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_23' data-id='MT27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_24' data-id='MT27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_25' data-id='MT27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_26' data-id='MT27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Mocked </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_27' data-id='MT27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span> Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_28' data-id='MT27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, </span>
<span class='v MT27_29' data-id='MT27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” </span>
<span class='v MT27_30' data-id='MT27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. </span>
<span class='v MT27_31' data-id='MT27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_32' data-id='MT27_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. </span>
<span class='v MT27_33' data-id='MT27_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span> And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), </span>
<span class='v MT27_34' data-id='MT27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. </span>
<span class='v MT27_35' data-id='MT27_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. </span>
<span class='v MT27_36' data-id='MT27_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. </span>
<span class='v MT27_37' data-id='MT27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_38' data-id='MT27_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. </span>
<span class='v MT27_39' data-id='MT27_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads </span>
<span class='v MT27_40' data-id='MT27_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_41' data-id='MT27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, </span>
<span class='v MT27_42' data-id='MT27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_43' data-id='MT27_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” </span>
<span class='v MT27_44' data-id='MT27_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_45' data-id='MT27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. </span>
<span class='v MT27_46' data-id='MT27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” </span>
<span class='v MT27_47' data-id='MT27_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_48' data-id='MT27_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. </span>
<span class='v MT27_49' data-id='MT27_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_50' data-id='MT27_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_51' data-id='MT27_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. </span>
<span class='v MT27_52' data-id='MT27_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, </span>
<span class='v MT27_53' data-id='MT27_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. </span>
<span class='v MT27_54' data-id='MT27_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span> When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, “Truly this was the Son of God!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_55' data-id='MT27_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, </span>
<span class='v MT27_56' data-id='MT27_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_57' data-id='MT27_57'><span class='v-num v-57'>57&nbsp;</span> When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v MT27_58' data-id='MT27_58'><span class='v-num v-58'>58&nbsp;</span>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. </span>
<span class='v MT27_59' data-id='MT27_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud </span>
<span class='v MT27_60' data-id='MT27_60'><span class='v-num v-60'>60&nbsp;</span>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. </span>
<span class='v MT27_61' data-id='MT27_61'><span class='v-num v-61'>61&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Guard at the Tomb </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT27_62' data-id='MT27_62'><span class='v-num v-62'>62&nbsp;</span>Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate </span>
<span class='v MT27_63' data-id='MT27_63'><span class='v-num v-63'>63&nbsp;</span>and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, ‘After three days I will rise.’ </span>
<span class='v MT27_64' data-id='MT27_64'><span class='v-num v-64'>64&nbsp;</span>Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_65' data-id='MT27_65'><span class='v-num v-65'>65&nbsp;</span>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.” </span>
<span class='v MT27_66' data-id='MT27_66'><span class='v-num v-66'>66&nbsp;</span>So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard. </span></div></div>
