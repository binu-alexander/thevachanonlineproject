<div class='s'>The Angel and the Little Scroll </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV10_1' data-id='RV10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire. </span>
<span class='v RV10_2' data-id='RV10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land, </span>
<span class='v RV10_3' data-id='RV10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded. </span>
<span class='v RV10_4' data-id='RV10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.” </span>
<span class='v RV10_5' data-id='RV10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven </span>
<span class='v RV10_6' data-id='RV10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay, </span>
<span class='v RV10_7' data-id='RV10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV10_8' data-id='RV10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” </span>
<span class='v RV10_9' data-id='RV10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, “Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” </span>
<span class='v RV10_10' data-id='RV10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter. </span>
<span class='v RV10_11' data-id='RV10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And I was told, “You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.” </span></div></div>
