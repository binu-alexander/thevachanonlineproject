<div class='p'>
<span class='v J15_1' data-id='J15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him. </span>
<span class='v J15_2' data-id='J15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments. </span>
<span class='v J15_3' data-id='J15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome. </span>
<span class='v J15_4' data-id='J15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. </span>

<span class='v J15_7' data-id='J15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For there are three that testify: </span>
<span class='v J15_8' data-id='J15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. </span>
<span class='v J15_9' data-id='J15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_10' data-id='J15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son. </span>
<span class='v J15_11' data-id='J15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. </span>

<span class='v J15_16' data-id='J15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life—to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that. </span>
<span class='v J15_17' data-id='J15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death. </span></div>
