<span class='v J15_4' data-id='J15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. </span>

<span class='v J15_7' data-id='J15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For there are three that testify: </span>
<span class='v J15_8' data-id='J15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree. </span>
<span class='v J15_9' data-id='J15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son. </span>
