<span class='v EP6_3' data-id='EP6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.” </span>
<span class='v EP6_4' data-id='EP6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord. </span></div>

<span class='v EP6_12' data-id='EP6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. </span>
