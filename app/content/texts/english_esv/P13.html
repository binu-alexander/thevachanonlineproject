<div class='s'>Wives and Husbands </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_1' data-id='P13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives— </span>
<span class='v P13_2' data-id='P13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>when they see your respectful and pure conduct. </span>
<span class='v P13_3' data-id='P13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair, the wearing of gold, or the putting on of clothing— </span>
<span class='v P13_4' data-id='P13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. </span>
<span class='v P13_5' data-id='P13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their husbands, </span>
<span class='v P13_6' data-id='P13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_7' data-id='P13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_8' data-id='P13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind. </span>
<span class='v P13_9' data-id='P13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing. </span>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>“Whoever desires to love life </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>and see good days, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>let him keep his tongue from evil </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_10' data-id='P13_10'>and his lips from speaking deceit; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_11' data-id='P13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>let him turn away from evil and do good; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_11' data-id='P13_11'>let him seek peace and pursue it. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'>and his ears are open to their prayer. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v P13_12' data-id='P13_12'>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_13' data-id='P13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good? </span>
<span class='v P13_14' data-id='P13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled, </span>
<span class='v P13_15' data-id='P13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>but in your hearts regard Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; </span>
<span class='v P13_16' data-id='P13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. </span>
<span class='v P13_17' data-id='P13_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P13_18' data-id='P13_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit, </span>
<span class='v P13_19' data-id='P13_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison, </span>
<span class='v P13_20' data-id='P13_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. </span>
<span class='v P13_21' data-id='P13_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v P13_22' data-id='P13_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him. </span></div></div>
