<div class='s'>Jesus Before Pilate </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_1' data-id='LK23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_2' data-id='LK23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation and forbidding us to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_3' data-id='LK23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, “You have said so.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_4' data-id='LK23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no guilt in this man.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_5' data-id='LK23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, from Galilee even to this place.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Before Herod </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_6' data-id='LK23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. </span>
<span class='v LK23_7' data-id='LK23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And when he learned that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time. </span>
<span class='v LK23_8' data-id='LK23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him, and he was hoping to see some sign done by him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_9' data-id='LK23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer. </span>
<span class='v LK23_10' data-id='LK23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_11' data-id='LK23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate. </span>
<span class='v LK23_12' data-id='LK23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_13' data-id='LK23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Pilate then called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, </span>
<span class='v LK23_14' data-id='LK23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. And after examining him before you, behold, I did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_15' data-id='LK23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_16' data-id='LK23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I will therefore punish and release him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_18' data-id='LK23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> But they all cried out together, “Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas”— </span>
<span class='v LK23_19' data-id='LK23_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and for murder. </span>
<span class='v LK23_20' data-id='LK23_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus, </span>
<span class='v LK23_21' data-id='LK23_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_22' data-id='LK23_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>A third time he said to them, “Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no guilt deserving death. I will therefore punish and release him.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_23' data-id='LK23_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed. </span>
<span class='v LK23_24' data-id='LK23_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. </span>
<span class='v LK23_25' data-id='LK23_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>He released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus over to their will. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Crucifixion </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_26' data-id='LK23_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK23_27' data-id='LK23_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were mourning and lamenting for him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_28' data-id='LK23_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But turning to them Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. </span>
<span class='v LK23_29' data-id='LK23_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’ </span>
<span class='v LK23_30' data-id='LK23_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’ </span>
<span class='v LK23_31' data-id='LK23_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_32' data-id='LK23_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him. </span>
<span class='v LK23_33' data-id='LK23_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. </span>
<span class='v LK23_34' data-id='LK23_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And they cast lots to divide his garments. </span>
<span class='v LK23_35' data-id='LK23_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And the people stood by, watching, but the rulers scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, his Chosen One!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_36' data-id='LK23_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine </span>
<span class='v LK23_37' data-id='LK23_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_38' data-id='LK23_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_39' data-id='LK23_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>One of the criminals who were hanged railed at him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_40' data-id='LK23_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? </span>
<span class='v LK23_41' data-id='LK23_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_42' data-id='LK23_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.” </span>
<span class='v LK23_43' data-id='LK23_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_44' data-id='LK23_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour, </span>
<span class='v LK23_45' data-id='LK23_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>while the sun's light failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two. </span>
<span class='v LK23_46' data-id='LK23_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” And having said this he breathed his last. </span>
<span class='v LK23_47' data-id='LK23_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>Now when the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!” </span>
<span class='v LK23_48' data-id='LK23_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. </span>
<span class='v LK23_49' data-id='LK23_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>And all his acquaintances and the women who had followed him from Galilee stood at a distance watching these things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Is Buried </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_50' data-id='LK23_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span> Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man, </span>
<span class='v LK23_51' data-id='LK23_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>who had not consented to their decision and action; and he was looking for the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v LK23_52' data-id='LK23_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK23_53' data-id='LK23_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span>Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and laid him in a tomb cut in stone, where no one had ever yet been laid. </span>
<span class='v LK23_54' data-id='LK23_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>It was the day of Preparation, and the Sabbath was beginning. </span>
<span class='v LK23_55' data-id='LK23_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was laid. </span>
<span class='v LK23_56' data-id='LK23_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK23_56' data-id='LK23_56'>On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. </span></div></div>
