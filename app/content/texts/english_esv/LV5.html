<span class='v LV5_2' data-id='LV5_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>or if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether a carcass of an unclean wild animal or a carcass of unclean livestock or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him and he has become unclean, and he realizes his guilt; </span>
<span class='v LV5_3' data-id='LV5_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and realizes his guilt; </span>
<span class='v LV5_4' data-id='LV5_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>or if anyone utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that people swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it, and he realizes his guilt in any of these; </span>
<span class='v LV5_5' data-id='LV5_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>when he realizes his guilt in any of these and confesses the sin he has committed, </span>
<span class='v LV5_6' data-id='LV5_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin. </span></div>

<span class='v LV5_7' data-id='LV5_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring to the LORD as his compensation for the sin that he has committed two turtledoves or two pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. </span>
<span class='v LV5_8' data-id='LV5_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering. He shall wring its head from its neck but shall not sever it completely, </span>
<span class='v LV5_9' data-id='LV5_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. </span>
<span class='v LV5_10' data-id='LV5_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the rule. And the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin that he has committed, and he shall be forgiven. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LV5_11' data-id='LV5_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for the sin that he has committed a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.

<span class='v LV5_12' data-id='LV5_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, on the LORD's food offerings; it is a sin offering. </span>
<span class='v LV5_13' data-id='LV5_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the grain offering.” </span></div>

<span class='v LV5_16' data-id='LV5_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest.
