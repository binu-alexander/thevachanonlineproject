<div class='s'>The Visit of the Wise Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_1' data-id='MT2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v MT2_2' data-id='MT2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_3' data-id='MT2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; </span>
<span class='v MT2_4' data-id='MT2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. </span>
<span class='v MT2_5' data-id='MT2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span> “ ‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>for from you shall come a ruler </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_6' data-id='MT2_6'>who will shepherd my people Israel.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_7' data-id='MT2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. </span>
<span class='v MT2_8' data-id='MT2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_9' data-id='MT2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. </span>
<span class='v MT2_10' data-id='MT2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. </span>
<span class='v MT2_11' data-id='MT2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. </span>
<span class='v MT2_12' data-id='MT2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Flight to Egypt </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_13' data-id='MT2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_14' data-id='MT2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt </span>
<span class='v MT2_15' data-id='MT2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my son.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Herod Kills the Children </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_16' data-id='MT2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. </span>
<span class='v MT2_17' data-id='MT2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span> “A voice was heard in Ramah, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>weeping and loud lamentation, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>Rachel weeping for her children; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT2_18' data-id='MT2_18'>she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Return to Nazareth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT2_19' data-id='MT2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, </span>
<span class='v MT2_20' data-id='MT2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead.” </span>
<span class='v MT2_21' data-id='MT2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. </span>
<span class='v MT2_22' data-id='MT2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MT2_23' data-id='MT2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: “He shall be called a Nazarene.” </span></div></div>
