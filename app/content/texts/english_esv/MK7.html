<div class='s'>Traditions and Commandments </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_1' data-id='MK7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v MK7_2' data-id='MK7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. </span>
<span class='v MK7_3' data-id='MK7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, holding to the tradition of the elders, </span>
<span class='v MK7_4' data-id='MK7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches.) </span>
<span class='v MK7_5' data-id='MK7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands?” </span>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'>“ ‘This people honors me with their lips, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK7_6' data-id='MK7_6'>but their heart is far from me; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MK7_7' data-id='MK7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>in vain do they worship me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MK7_7' data-id='MK7_7'>teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MK7_8' data-id='MK7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_9' data-id='MK7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! </span>
<span class='v MK7_10' data-id='MK7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother’; and, ‘Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.’ </span>
<span class='v MK7_11' data-id='MK7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban’ (that is, given to God) — </span>
<span class='v MK7_12' data-id='MK7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, </span>
<span class='v MK7_13' data-id='MK7_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>What Defiles a Person </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_14' data-id='MK7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he called the people to him again and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand: </span>
<span class='v MK7_15' data-id='MK7_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him.” </span>
<span class='v MK7_17' data-id='MK7_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. </span>
<span class='v MK7_18' data-id='MK7_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, </span>
<span class='v MK7_19' data-id='MK7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled?” (Thus he declared all foods clean.) </span>
<span class='v MK7_20' data-id='MK7_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he said, “What comes out of a person is what defiles him. </span>
<span class='v MK7_21' data-id='MK7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, </span>
<span class='v MK7_22' data-id='MK7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. </span>
<span class='v MK7_23' data-id='MK7_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Syrophoenician Woman's Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_24' data-id='MK7_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. </span>
<span class='v MK7_25' data-id='MK7_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But immediately a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. </span>
<span class='v MK7_26' data-id='MK7_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. </span>
<span class='v MK7_27' data-id='MK7_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.” </span>
<span class='v MK7_28' data-id='MK7_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.” </span>
<span class='v MK7_29' data-id='MK7_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, “For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.” </span>
<span class='v MK7_30' data-id='MK7_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals a Deaf Man </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK7_31' data-id='MK7_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. </span>
<span class='v MK7_32' data-id='MK7_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. </span>
<span class='v MK7_33' data-id='MK7_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. </span>
<span class='v MK7_34' data-id='MK7_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.” </span>
<span class='v MK7_35' data-id='MK7_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. </span>
<span class='v MK7_36' data-id='MK7_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. </span>
<span class='v MK7_37' data-id='MK7_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.” </span></div></div>
