<span class='v EK40_2' data-id='EK40_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>In visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain, on which was a structure like a city to the south. </span>
<span class='v EK40_3' data-id='EK40_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>When he brought me there, behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring reed in his hand. And he was standing in the gateway. </span>
<span class='v EK40_4' data-id='EK40_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the man said to me, “Son of man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart upon all that I shall show you, for you were brought here in order that I might show it to you. Declare all that you see to the house of Israel.” </span></div>
