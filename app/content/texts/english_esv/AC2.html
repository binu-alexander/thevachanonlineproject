<div class='s'>The Coming of the Holy Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_1' data-id='AC2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. </span>
<span class='v AC2_2' data-id='AC2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. </span>
<span class='v AC2_3' data-id='AC2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. </span>
<span class='v AC2_4' data-id='AC2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_5' data-id='AC2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. </span>
<span class='v AC2_6' data-id='AC2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. </span>
<span class='v AC2_7' data-id='AC2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And they were amazed and astonished, saying, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? </span>
<span class='v AC2_8' data-id='AC2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? </span>
<span class='v AC2_9' data-id='AC2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, </span>
<span class='v AC2_10' data-id='AC2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, </span>
<span class='v AC2_11' data-id='AC2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians—we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God.” </span>
<span class='v AC2_12' data-id='AC2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” </span>
<span class='v AC2_13' data-id='AC2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But others mocking said, “They are filled with new wine.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter's Sermon at Pentecost </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_14' data-id='AC2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them, “Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. </span>
<span class='v AC2_15' data-id='AC2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. </span>
<span class='v AC2_16' data-id='AC2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> “ ‘And in the last days it shall be, God declares, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>and your young men shall see visions, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_17' data-id='AC2_17'>and your old men shall dream dreams; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>even on my male servants and female servants </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_18' data-id='AC2_18'>in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. </span></div>

<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I will show wonders in the heavens above </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'>and signs on the earth below, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_19' data-id='AC2_19'>blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>the sun shall be turned to darkness </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'>and the moon to blood, </span></div>
<div class='q3'>
<span class='v AC2_20' data-id='AC2_20'>before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_21' data-id='AC2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_22' data-id='AC2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>“Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know— </span>
<span class='v AC2_23' data-id='AC2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. </span>
<span class='v AC2_24' data-id='AC2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. </span>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>For David says concerning him, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'>“ ‘I saw the Lord always before me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_25' data-id='AC2_25'>for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_26' data-id='AC2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_26' data-id='AC2_26'>my flesh also will dwell in hope. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_27' data-id='AC2_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_27' data-id='AC2_27'>or let your Holy One see corruption. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_28' data-id='AC2_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You have made known to me the paths of life; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_28' data-id='AC2_28'>you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_29' data-id='AC2_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>“Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. </span>
<span class='v AC2_30' data-id='AC2_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, </span>
<span class='v AC2_31' data-id='AC2_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. </span>
<span class='v AC2_32' data-id='AC2_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. </span>
<span class='v AC2_33' data-id='AC2_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. </span>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'>“ ‘The Lord said to my Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v AC2_34' data-id='AC2_34'>Sit at my right hand, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v AC2_35' data-id='AC2_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>until I make your enemies your footstool.’ </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v AC2_36' data-id='AC2_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_37' data-id='AC2_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?” </span>
<span class='v AC2_38' data-id='AC2_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v AC2_39' data-id='AC2_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.” </span>
<span class='v AC2_40' data-id='AC2_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, “Save yourselves from this crooked generation.” </span>
<span class='v AC2_41' data-id='AC2_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Fellowship of the Believers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC2_42' data-id='AC2_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. </span>
<span class='v AC2_43' data-id='AC2_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. </span>
<span class='v AC2_44' data-id='AC2_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And all who believed were together and had all things in common. </span>
<span class='v AC2_45' data-id='AC2_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. </span>
<span class='v AC2_46' data-id='AC2_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, </span>
<span class='v AC2_47' data-id='AC2_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. </span></div></div>
