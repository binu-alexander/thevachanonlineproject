<div class='s'>Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB8_1' data-id='HB8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, </span>
<span class='v HB8_2' data-id='HB8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man. </span>
<span class='v HB8_3' data-id='HB8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer. </span>
<span class='v HB8_4' data-id='HB8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law. </span>
<span class='v HB8_5' data-id='HB8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, “See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.” </span>
<span class='v HB8_6' data-id='HB8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises. </span>
<span class='v HB8_7' data-id='HB8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For he finds fault with them when he says: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'>when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_8' data-id='HB8_8'>and with the house of Judah, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>not like the covenant that I made with their fathers </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>For they did not continue in my covenant, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_9' data-id='HB8_9'>and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>after those days, declares the Lord: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>I will put my laws into their minds, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>and write them on their hearts, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>and I will be their God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_10' data-id='HB8_10'>and they shall be my people. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>for they shall all know me, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_11' data-id='HB8_11'>from the least of them to the greatest. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB8_12' data-id='HB8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB8_12' data-id='HB8_12'>and I will remember their sins no more.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB8_13' data-id='HB8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away. </span></div></div>
