<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='s'>Greeting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_1' data-id='RM1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God, </span>
<span class='v RM1_2' data-id='RM1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures, </span>
<span class='v RM1_3' data-id='RM1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh </span>
<span class='v RM1_4' data-id='RM1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, </span>
<span class='v RM1_5' data-id='RM1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations, </span>
<span class='v RM1_6' data-id='RM1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_7' data-id='RM1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_7' data-id='RM1_7'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Longing to Go to Rome </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_8' data-id='RM1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world. </span>
<span class='v RM1_9' data-id='RM1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you </span>
<span class='v RM1_10' data-id='RM1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you. </span>
<span class='v RM1_11' data-id='RM1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you— </span>
<span class='v RM1_12' data-id='RM1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. </span>
<span class='v RM1_13' data-id='RM1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v RM1_14' data-id='RM1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. </span>
<span class='v RM1_15' data-id='RM1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Righteous Shall Live by Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_16' data-id='RM1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. </span>
<span class='v RM1_17' data-id='RM1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The righteous shall live by faith.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>God's Wrath on Unrighteousness </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_18' data-id='RM1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. </span>
<span class='v RM1_19' data-id='RM1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. </span>
<span class='v RM1_20' data-id='RM1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. </span>
<span class='v RM1_21' data-id='RM1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. </span>
<span class='v RM1_22' data-id='RM1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Claiming to be wise, they became fools, </span>
<span class='v RM1_23' data-id='RM1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_24' data-id='RM1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, </span>
<span class='v RM1_25' data-id='RM1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_26' data-id='RM1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; </span>
<span class='v RM1_27' data-id='RM1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM1_28' data-id='RM1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. </span>
<span class='v RM1_29' data-id='RM1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, </span>
<span class='v RM1_30' data-id='RM1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, </span>
<span class='v RM1_31' data-id='RM1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. </span>
<span class='v RM1_32' data-id='RM1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. </span></div></div>
