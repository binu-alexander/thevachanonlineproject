<div class='s'>Job's Confession and Repentance </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_1' data-id='JB42_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then Job answered the LORD and said: </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_2' data-id='JB42_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“I know that you can do all things, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_2' data-id='JB42_2'>and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>‘Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?’ </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_3' data-id='JB42_3'>things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>‘Hear, and I will speak; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_4' data-id='JB42_4'>I will question you, and you make it known to me.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_5' data-id='JB42_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_5' data-id='JB42_5'>but now my eye sees you; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JB42_6' data-id='JB42_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>therefore I despise myself, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JB42_6' data-id='JB42_6'>and repent in dust and ashes.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The LORD Rebukes Job's Friends </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_7' data-id='JB42_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: “My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. </span>
<span class='v JB42_8' data-id='JB42_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.” </span>
<span class='v JB42_9' data-id='JB42_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The LORD Restores Job's Fortunes </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_10' data-id='JB42_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. </span>
<span class='v JB42_11' data-id='JB42_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JB42_12' data-id='JB42_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. </span>
<span class='v JB42_13' data-id='JB42_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He had also seven sons and three daughters. </span>
<span class='v JB42_14' data-id='JB42_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. </span>
<span class='v JB42_15' data-id='JB42_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. </span>
<span class='v JB42_16' data-id='JB42_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations. </span>
<span class='v JB42_17' data-id='JB42_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And Job died, an old man, and full of days. </span></div></div>
