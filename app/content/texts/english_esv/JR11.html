<div class='s'>The Broken Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_1' data-id='JR11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD: </span>
<span class='v JR11_2' data-id='JR11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR11_3' data-id='JR11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You shall say to them, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant </span>
<span class='v JR11_4' data-id='JR11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. So shall you be my people, and I will be your God, </span>
<span class='v JR11_5' data-id='JR11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_6' data-id='JR11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: Hear the words of this covenant and do them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_7' data-id='JR11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, Obey my voice. </span>
<span class='v JR11_8' data-id='JR11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_9' data-id='JR11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Again the LORD said to me, “A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR11_10' data-id='JR11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. They have gone after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers. </span>
<span class='v JR11_11' data-id='JR11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore, thus says the LORD, behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them. </span>
<span class='v JR11_12' data-id='JR11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble. </span>
<span class='v JR11_13' data-id='JR11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, altars to make offerings to Baal. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_14' data-id='JR11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“Therefore do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble. </span>
<span class='v JR11_15' data-id='JR11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>What right has my beloved in my house, when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? Can you then exult? </span>
<span class='v JR11_16' data-id='JR11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The LORD once called you ‘a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.’ But with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and its branches will be consumed. </span>
<span class='v JR11_17' data-id='JR11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The LORD of hosts, who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_18' data-id='JR11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The LORD made it known to me and I knew; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_18' data-id='JR11_18'>then you showed me their deeds. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I was like a gentle lamb </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>led to the slaughter. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>I did not know it was against me </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>they devised schemes, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>“Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>let us cut him off from the land of the living, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_19' data-id='JR11_19'>that his name be remembered no more.” </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But, O LORD of hosts, who judges righteously, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>who tests the heart and the mind, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>let me see your vengeance upon them, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v JR11_20' data-id='JR11_20'>for to you have I committed my cause. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR11_21' data-id='JR11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the men of Anathoth, who seek your life, and say, “Do not prophesy in the name of the LORD, or you will die by our hand”— </span>
<span class='v JR11_22' data-id='JR11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine, </span>
<span class='v JR11_23' data-id='JR11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of Anathoth, the year of their punishment.” </span></div></div>
