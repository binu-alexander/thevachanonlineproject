<div class='s'>Zedekiah to Die in Babylon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR34_1' data-id='JR34_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities: </span>
<span class='v JR34_2' data-id='JR34_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. </span>
<span class='v JR34_3' data-id='JR34_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’ </span>
<span class='v JR34_4' data-id='JR34_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the LORD concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. </span>
<span class='v JR34_5' data-id='JR34_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>You shall die in peace. And as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so people shall burn spices for you and lament for you, saying, “Alas, lord!” ’ For I have spoken the word, declares the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR34_6' data-id='JR34_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v JR34_7' data-id='JR34_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, Lachish and Azekah, for these were the only fortified cities of Judah that remained. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR34_8' data-id='JR34_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them, </span>
<span class='v JR34_9' data-id='JR34_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves, male and female, so that no one should enslave a Jew, his brother. </span>
<span class='v JR34_10' data-id='JR34_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free. </span>
<span class='v JR34_11' data-id='JR34_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves. </span>
<span class='v JR34_12' data-id='JR34_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD: </span>
<span class='v JR34_13' data-id='JR34_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR34_14' data-id='JR34_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>‘At the end of seven years each of you must set free the fellow Hebrew who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you must set him free from your service.’ But your fathers did not listen to me or incline their ears to me. </span>
<span class='v JR34_15' data-id='JR34_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name, </span>
<span class='v JR34_16' data-id='JR34_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>but then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR34_17' data-id='JR34_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, thus says the LORD: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; behold, I proclaim to you liberty to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the LORD. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JR34_18' data-id='JR34_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the men who transgressed my covenant and did not keep the terms of the covenant that they made before me, I will make them like the calf that they cut in two and passed between its parts— </span>
<span class='v JR34_19' data-id='JR34_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf. </span>
<span class='v JR34_20' data-id='JR34_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And I will give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives. Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. </span>
<span class='v JR34_21' data-id='JR34_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives, into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you. </span>
<span class='v JR34_22' data-id='JR34_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Behold, I will command, declares the LORD, and will bring them back to this city. And they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire. I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.” </span></div></div>
