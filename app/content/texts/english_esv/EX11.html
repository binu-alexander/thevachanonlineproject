<div class='s'>A Final Plague Threatened </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX11_1' data-id='EX11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The LORD said to Moses, “Yet one plague more I will bring upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt. Afterward he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will drive you away completely. </span>
<span class='v EX11_2' data-id='EX11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Speak now in the hearing of the people, that they ask, every man of his neighbor and every woman of her neighbor, for silver and gold jewelry.” </span>
<span class='v EX11_3' data-id='EX11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the sight of the people. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX11_4' data-id='EX11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>So Moses said, “Thus says the LORD: About midnight I will go out in the midst of Egypt, </span>
<span class='v EX11_5' data-id='EX11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the handmill, and all the firstborn of the cattle. </span>
<span class='v EX11_6' data-id='EX11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been, nor ever will be again. </span>
<span class='v EX11_7' data-id='EX11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But not a dog shall growl against any of the people of Israel, either man or beast, that you may know that the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. </span>
<span class='v EX11_8' data-id='EX11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And all these your servants shall come down to me and bow down to me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you.’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger. </span>
<span class='v EX11_9' data-id='EX11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EX11_10' data-id='EX11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the people of Israel go out of his land. </span></div></div>
