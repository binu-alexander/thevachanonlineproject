<div class='s'>Qualifications for Overseers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T13_1' data-id='T13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task. </span>
<span class='v T13_2' data-id='T13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, </span>
<span class='v T13_3' data-id='T13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. </span>
<span class='v T13_4' data-id='T13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, </span>
<span class='v T13_5' data-id='T13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? </span>
<span class='v T13_6' data-id='T13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. </span>
<span class='v T13_7' data-id='T13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Qualifications for Deacons </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T13_8' data-id='T13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain. </span>
<span class='v T13_9' data-id='T13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. </span>
<span class='v T13_10' data-id='T13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless. </span>
<span class='v T13_11' data-id='T13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. </span>
<span class='v T13_12' data-id='T13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. </span>
<span class='v T13_13' data-id='T13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Mystery of Godliness </div>

<span class='v T13_14' data-id='T13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that, </span>
<span class='v T13_15' data-id='T13_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of truth. </span>
<span class='v T13_16' data-id='T13_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v T13_16' data-id='T13_16'>He was manifested in the flesh, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
