<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='s'>Greeting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_1' data-id='GL1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul, an apostle—not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— </span>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and all the brothers who are with me, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_2' data-id='GL1_2'>To the churches of Galatia: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_3' data-id='GL1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, </span>
<span class='v GL1_4' data-id='GL1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father, </span>
<span class='v GL1_5' data-id='GL1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>No Other Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_6' data-id='GL1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel— </span>
<span class='v GL1_7' data-id='GL1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_8' data-id='GL1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. </span>
<span class='v GL1_9' data-id='GL1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_10' data-id='GL1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul Called by God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_11' data-id='GL1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. </span>
<span class='v GL1_12' data-id='GL1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_13' data-id='GL1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it. </span>
<span class='v GL1_14' data-id='GL1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers. </span>
<span class='v GL1_15' data-id='GL1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace, </span>
<span class='v GL1_16' data-id='GL1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone; </span>
<span class='v GL1_17' data-id='GL1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GL1_18' data-id='GL1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days. </span>
<span class='v GL1_19' data-id='GL1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. </span>
<span class='v GL1_20' data-id='GL1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>(In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!) </span>
<span class='v GL1_21' data-id='GL1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. </span>
<span class='v GL1_22' data-id='GL1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. </span>
<span class='v GL1_23' data-id='GL1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>They only were hearing it said, “He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.” </span>
<span class='v GL1_24' data-id='GL1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And they glorified God because of me. </span></div></div>
