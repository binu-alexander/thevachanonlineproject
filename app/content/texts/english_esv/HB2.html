<div class='s'>Warning Against Neglecting Salvation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_1' data-id='HB2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it. </span>
<span class='v HB2_2' data-id='HB2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, </span>
<span class='v HB2_3' data-id='HB2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, </span>
<span class='v HB2_4' data-id='HB2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Founder of Salvation </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_5' data-id='HB2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. </span>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>It has been testified somewhere, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>“What is man, that you are mindful of him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_6' data-id='HB2_6'>or the son of man, that you care for him? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>You made him for a little while lower than the angels; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_7' data-id='HB2_7'>you have crowned him with glory and honor, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>putting everything in subjection under his feet.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_8' data-id='HB2_8'>Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. </span>
<span class='v HB2_9' data-id='HB2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_10' data-id='HB2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering. </span>
<span class='v HB2_11' data-id='HB2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, </span>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'>“I will tell of your name to my brothers; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB2_12' data-id='HB2_12'>in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And again, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'>“I will put my trust in him.” And again, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB2_13' data-id='HB2_13'>“Behold, I and the children God has given me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB2_14' data-id='HB2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, </span>
<span class='v HB2_15' data-id='HB2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. </span>
<span class='v HB2_16' data-id='HB2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. </span>
<span class='v HB2_17' data-id='HB2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. </span>
<span class='v HB2_18' data-id='HB2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. </span></div></div>
