<div class='s'>The Ruined Loincloth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_1' data-id='JR13_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.” </span>
<span class='v JR13_2' data-id='JR13_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the LORD, and put it around my waist. </span>
<span class='v JR13_3' data-id='JR13_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And the word of the LORD came to me a second time, </span>
<span class='v JR13_4' data-id='JR13_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>“Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.” </span>
<span class='v JR13_5' data-id='JR13_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. </span>
<span class='v JR13_6' data-id='JR13_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And after many days the LORD said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.” </span>
<span class='v JR13_7' data-id='JR13_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was spoiled; it was good for nothing. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_8' data-id='JR13_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v JR13_9' data-id='JR13_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Thus says the LORD: Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR13_10' data-id='JR13_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is good for nothing. </span>
<span class='v JR13_11' data-id='JR13_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the LORD, that they might be for me a people, a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Jars Filled with Wine </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR13_12' data-id='JR13_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.” ’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?’ </span>
<span class='v JR13_13' data-id='JR13_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the LORD: Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR13_14' data-id='JR13_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And I will dash them one against another, fathers and sons together, declares the LORD. I will not pity or spare or have compassion, that I should not destroy them.’ ” </span></div>
