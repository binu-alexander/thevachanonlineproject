<div class='s'>The Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_1' data-id='JN20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. </span>
<span class='v JN20_2' data-id='JN20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_3' data-id='JN20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb. </span>
<span class='v JN20_4' data-id='JN20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first. </span>
<span class='v JN20_5' data-id='JN20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. </span>
<span class='v JN20_6' data-id='JN20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there, </span>
<span class='v JN20_7' data-id='JN20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and the face cloth, which had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself. </span>
<span class='v JN20_8' data-id='JN20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; </span>
<span class='v JN20_9' data-id='JN20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>for as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN20_10' data-id='JN20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then the disciples went back to their homes. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_11' data-id='JN20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb. </span>
<span class='v JN20_12' data-id='JN20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet. </span>
<span class='v JN20_13' data-id='JN20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_14' data-id='JN20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN20_15' data-id='JN20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_16' data-id='JN20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni!” (which means Teacher). </span>
<span class='v JN20_17' data-id='JN20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’ ” </span>
<span class='v JN20_18' data-id='JN20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”—and that he had said these things to her. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Appears to the Disciples </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_19' data-id='JN20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_20' data-id='JN20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. </span>
<span class='v JN20_21' data-id='JN20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_22' data-id='JN20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. </span>
<span class='v JN20_23' data-id='JN20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>If you forgive the sins of anyone, they are forgiven; if you withhold forgiveness from anyone, it is withheld.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus and Thomas </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_24' data-id='JN20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Now Thomas, one of the Twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came. </span>
<span class='v JN20_25' data-id='JN20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_26' data-id='JN20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_27' data-id='JN20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe.” </span>
<span class='v JN20_28' data-id='JN20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!” </span>
<span class='v JN20_29' data-id='JN20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Purpose of This Book </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN20_30' data-id='JN20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; </span>
<span class='v JN20_31' data-id='JN20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. </span></div></div>
