<span class='v DT15_1' data-id='DT15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release. </span>
<span class='v DT15_2' data-id='DT15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And this is the manner of the release: every creditor shall release what he has lent to his neighbor. He shall not exact it of his neighbor, his brother, because the LORD'S release has been proclaimed. </span>
<span class='v DT15_3' data-id='DT15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Of a foreigner you may exact it, but whatever of yours is with your brother your hand shall release. </span>
<span class='v DT15_4' data-id='DT15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But there will be no poor among you; for the LORD will bless you in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance to possess— </span>
<span class='v DT15_5' data-id='DT15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>if only you will strictly obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all this commandment that I command you today. </span>
<span class='v DT15_6' data-id='DT15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For the LORD your God will bless you, as he promised you, and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow, and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over you. </span></div>

<span class='v DT15_7' data-id='DT15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“If among you, one of your brothers should become poor, in any of your towns within your land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not harden your heart or shut your hand against your poor brother, </span>
<span class='v DT15_8' data-id='DT15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>but you shall open your hand to him and lend him sufficient for his need, whatever it may be. </span>
<span class='v DT15_9' data-id='DT15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Take care lest there be an unworthy thought in your heart and you say, ‘The seventh year, the year of release is near,’ and your eye look grudgingly on your poor brother, and you give him nothing, and he cry to the LORD against you, and you be guilty of sin. </span>
<span class='v DT15_10' data-id='DT15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>You shall give to him freely, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake. </span>
<span class='v DT15_11' data-id='DT15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For there will never cease to be poor in the land. Therefore I command you, ‘You shall open wide your hand to your brother, to the needy and to the poor, in your land.’ </span></div>

<span class='v DT15_13' data-id='DT15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And when you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty-handed. </span>
<span class='v DT15_14' data-id='DT15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock, out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress. As the LORD your God has blessed you, you shall give to him. </span>
<span class='v DT15_15' data-id='DT15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore I command you this today. </span>
<span class='v DT15_16' data-id='DT15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But if he says to you, ‘I will not go out from you,’ because he loves you and your household, since he is well-off with you, </span>
<span class='v DT15_17' data-id='DT15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>then you shall take an awl, and put it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your slave forever. And to your female slave you shall do the same. </span>
<span class='v DT15_18' data-id='DT15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>It shall not seem hard to you when you let him go free from you, for at half the cost of a hired servant he has served you six years. So the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do. </span></div>
