<span class='v DT4_2' data-id='DT4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God that I command you. </span>
<span class='v DT4_3' data-id='DT4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor, for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Baal of Peor. </span>
<span class='v DT4_4' data-id='DT4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive today. </span>
<span class='v DT4_5' data-id='DT4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>See, I have taught you statutes and rules, as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do them in the land that you are entering to take possession of it. </span>
<span class='v DT4_6' data-id='DT4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Keep them and do them, for that will be your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who, when they hear all these statutes, will say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ </span>
<span class='v DT4_7' data-id='DT4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God is to us, whenever we call upon him? </span>
<span class='v DT4_8' data-id='DT4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And what great nation is there, that has statutes and rules so righteous as all this law that I set before you today? </span></div>

<span class='v DT4_9' data-id='DT4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Only take care, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things that your eyes have seen, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your children's children— </span>
<span class='v DT4_10' data-id='DT4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>how on the day that you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb, the LORD said to me, ‘Gather the people to me, that I may let them hear my words, so that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children so.’ </span>
<span class='v DT4_11' data-id='DT4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while the mountain burned with fire to the heart of heaven, wrapped in darkness, cloud, and gloom. </span>
<span class='v DT4_12' data-id='DT4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD spoke to you out of the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but saw no form; there was only a voice. </span>
<span class='v DT4_13' data-id='DT4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone. </span>
<span class='v DT4_14' data-id='DT4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land that you are going over to possess. </span></div>

<span class='v DT4_20' data-id='DT4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of his own inheritance, as you are this day. </span>
<span class='v DT4_21' data-id='DT4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, the LORD was angry with me because of you, and he swore that I should not cross the Jordan, and that I should not enter the good land that the LORD your God is giving you for an inheritance. </span>

<span class='v DT4_24' data-id='DT4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For the LORD your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. </span></div>

<span class='v DT4_26' data-id='DT4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>I call heaven and earth to witness against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. You will not live long in it, but will be utterly destroyed. </span>
<span class='v DT4_27' data-id='DT4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD will drive you. </span>
<span class='v DT4_28' data-id='DT4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And there you will serve gods of wood and stone, the work of human hands, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. </span>
<span class='v DT4_29' data-id='DT4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But from there you will seek the LORD your God and you will find him, if you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul. </span>
<span class='v DT4_30' data-id='DT4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>When you are in tribulation, and all these things come upon you in the latter days, you will return to the LORD your God and obey his voice. </span>
<span class='v DT4_31' data-id='DT4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>For the LORD your God is a merciful God. He will not leave you or destroy you or forget the covenant with your fathers that he swore to them. </span></div>

<span class='v DT4_32' data-id='DT4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>“For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of heaven to the other, whether such a great thing as this has ever happened or was ever heard of. </span>
<span class='v DT4_33' data-id='DT4_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Did any people ever hear the voice of a god speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and still live? </span>

<span class='v DT4_35' data-id='DT4_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>To you it was shown, that you might know that the LORD is God; there is no other besides him. </span>
<span class='v DT4_36' data-id='DT4_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Out of heaven he let you hear his voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire. </span>
<span class='v DT4_37' data-id='DT4_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And because he loved your fathers and chose their offspring after them and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence, by his great power, </span>
<span class='v DT4_38' data-id='DT4_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>driving out before you nations greater and mightier than yourselves, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as it is this day, </span>
<span class='v DT4_39' data-id='DT4_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>know therefore today, and lay it to your heart, that the LORD is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is no other. </span>
<span class='v DT4_40' data-id='DT4_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>Therefore you shall keep his statutes and his commandments, which I command you today, that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land that the LORD your God is giving you for all time.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Cities of Refuge </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DT4_41' data-id='DT4_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Then Moses set apart three cities in the east beyond the Jordan, </span>

<span class='v DT4_47' data-id='DT4_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And they took possession of his land and the land of Og, the king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who lived to the east beyond the Jordan; </span>
