<div class='s'>Nathan Rebukes David </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S212_1' data-id='S212_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him and said to him, “There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor. </span>
<span class='v S212_2' data-id='S212_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The rich man had very many flocks and herds, </span>
<span class='v S212_3' data-id='S212_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children. It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup and lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him. </span>
<span class='v S212_4' data-id='S212_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the guest who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to him.” </span>
<span class='v S212_5' data-id='S212_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die, </span>
<span class='v S212_6' data-id='S212_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S212_7' data-id='S212_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul. </span>
<span class='v S212_8' data-id='S212_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And I gave you your master's house and your master's wives into your arms and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah. And if this were too little, I would add to you as much more. </span>
<span class='v S212_9' data-id='S212_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife and have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. </span>
<span class='v S212_10' data-id='S212_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ </span>
<span class='v S212_11' data-id='S212_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house. And I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun. </span>
<span class='v S212_12' data-id='S212_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.’ ” </span>
<span class='v S212_13' data-id='S212_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. </span>
<span class='v S212_14' data-id='S212_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child who is born to you shall die.” </span>
<span class='v S212_15' data-id='S212_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Nathan went to his house. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v S212_15' data-id='S212_15'>David's Child Dies </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S212_15' data-id='S212_15'>And the LORD afflicted the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and he became sick. </span>
<span class='v S212_16' data-id='S212_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>David therefore sought God on behalf of the child. And David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. </span>
<span class='v S212_17' data-id='S212_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground, but he would not, nor did he eat food with them. </span>
<span class='v S212_18' data-id='S212_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us. How then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm.” </span>
<span class='v S212_19' data-id='S212_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, “Is the child dead?” They said, “He is dead.” </span>
<span class='v S212_20' data-id='S212_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. </span>
<span class='v S212_21' data-id='S212_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.” </span>
<span class='v S212_22' data-id='S212_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>He said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?’ </span>
<span class='v S212_23' data-id='S212_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Solomon's Birth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S212_24' data-id='S212_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him </span>
<span class='v S212_25' data-id='S212_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet. So he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Rabbah Is Captured </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S212_26' data-id='S212_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and took the royal city. </span>
<span class='v S212_27' data-id='S212_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters. </span>
<span class='v S212_28' data-id='S212_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Now then gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it, lest I take the city and it be called by my name.” </span>
<span class='v S212_29' data-id='S212_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it. </span>
<span class='v S212_30' data-id='S212_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And he took the crown of their king from his head. The weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone, and it was placed on David's head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount. </span>
<span class='v S212_31' data-id='S212_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he brought out the people who were in it and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes and made them toil at the brick kilns. And thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. </span></div></div>
