<div class='s'>Temptations to Sin </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_1' data-id='LK17_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And he said to his disciples, “Temptations to sin are sure to come, but woe to the one through whom they come! </span>
<span class='v LK17_2' data-id='LK17_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to sin. </span>
<span class='v LK17_3' data-id='LK17_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, </span>
<span class='v LK17_4' data-id='LK17_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Increase Our Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_5' data-id='LK17_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!” </span>
<span class='v LK17_6' data-id='LK17_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the Lord said, “If you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Unworthy Servants </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_7' data-id='LK17_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>“Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and recline at table’? </span>
<span class='v LK17_8' data-id='LK17_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink’? </span>
<span class='v LK17_9' data-id='LK17_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? </span>
<span class='v LK17_10' data-id='LK17_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Cleanses Ten Lepers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_11' data-id='LK17_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. </span>
<span class='v LK17_12' data-id='LK17_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance </span>
<span class='v LK17_13' data-id='LK17_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” </span>
<span class='v LK17_14' data-id='LK17_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. </span>
<span class='v LK17_15' data-id='LK17_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; </span>
<span class='v LK17_16' data-id='LK17_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. </span>
<span class='v LK17_17' data-id='LK17_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? </span>
<span class='v LK17_18' data-id='LK17_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” </span>
<span class='v LK17_19' data-id='LK17_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Coming of the Kingdom </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_20' data-id='LK17_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, </span>
<span class='v LK17_21' data-id='LK17_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK17_22' data-id='LK17_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. </span>
<span class='v LK17_23' data-id='LK17_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And they will say to you, ‘Look, there!’ or ‘Look, here!’ Do not go out or follow them. </span>
<span class='v LK17_24' data-id='LK17_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. </span>
<span class='v LK17_25' data-id='LK17_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. </span>
<span class='v LK17_26' data-id='LK17_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Just as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man. </span>
<span class='v LK17_27' data-id='LK17_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>They were eating and drinking and marrying and being given in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. </span>
<span class='v LK17_28' data-id='LK17_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, </span>
<span class='v LK17_29' data-id='LK17_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but on the day when Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed them all— </span>
<span class='v LK17_30' data-id='LK17_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>so will it be on the day when the Son of Man is revealed. </span>
<span class='v LK17_31' data-id='LK17_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>On that day, let the one who is on the housetop, with his goods in the house, not come down to take them away, and likewise let the one who is in the field not turn back. </span>
<span class='v LK17_32' data-id='LK17_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Remember Lot's wife. </span>
<span class='v LK17_33' data-id='LK17_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will keep it. </span>
<span class='v LK17_34' data-id='LK17_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>I tell you, in that night there will be two in one bed. One will be taken and the other left. </span>
<span class='v LK17_35' data-id='LK17_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>There will be two women grinding together. One will be taken and the other left.” </span>
<span class='v LK17_37' data-id='LK17_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And they said to him, “Where, Lord?” He said to them, “Where the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.” </span></div></div>
