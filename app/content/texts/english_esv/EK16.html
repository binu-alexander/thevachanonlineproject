<span class='v EK16_1' data-id='EK16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Again the word of the LORD came to me: </span>
<span class='v EK16_2' data-id='EK16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations, </span>
<span class='v EK16_3' data-id='EK16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and say, Thus says the Lord GOD to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth are of the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. </span>
<span class='v EK16_4' data-id='EK16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And as for your birth, on the day you were born your cord was not cut, nor were you washed with water to cleanse you, nor rubbed with salt, nor wrapped in swaddling cloths. </span>
<span class='v EK16_5' data-id='EK16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>No eye pitied you, to do any of these things to you out of compassion for you, but you were cast out on the open field, for you were abhorred, on the day that you were born. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_6' data-id='EK16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“And when I passed by you and saw you wallowing in your blood, I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ I said to you in your blood, ‘Live!’ </span>
<span class='v EK16_7' data-id='EK16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>I made you flourish like a plant of the field. And you grew up and became tall and arrived at full adornment. Your breasts were formed, and your hair had grown; yet you were naked and bare. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_8' data-id='EK16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“When I passed by you again and saw you, behold, you were at the age for love, and I spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness; I made my vow to you and entered into a covenant with you, declares the Lord GOD, and you became mine. </span>
<span class='v EK16_9' data-id='EK16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then I bathed you with water and washed off your blood from you and anointed you with oil. </span>
<span class='v EK16_10' data-id='EK16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I clothed you also with embroidered cloth and shod you with fine leather. I wrapped you in fine linen and covered you with silk. </span>
<span class='v EK16_11' data-id='EK16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And I adorned you with ornaments and put bracelets on your wrists and a chain on your neck. </span>
<span class='v EK16_12' data-id='EK16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And I put a ring on your nose and earrings in your ears and a beautiful crown on your head. </span>
<span class='v EK16_13' data-id='EK16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour and honey and oil. You grew exceedingly beautiful and advanced to royalty. </span>
<span class='v EK16_14' data-id='EK16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And your renown went forth among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through the splendor that I had bestowed on you, declares the Lord GOD. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_15' data-id='EK16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“But you trusted in your beauty and played the whore because of your renown and lavished your whorings on any passerby; your beauty became his. </span>
<span class='v EK16_16' data-id='EK16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You took some of your garments and made for yourself colorful shrines, and on them played the whore. The like has never been, nor ever shall be. </span>
<span class='v EK16_17' data-id='EK16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>You also took your beautiful jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself images of men, and with them played the whore. </span>
<span class='v EK16_18' data-id='EK16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And you took your embroidered garments to cover them, and set my oil and my incense before them. </span>
<span class='v EK16_19' data-id='EK16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Also my bread that I gave you—I fed you with fine flour and oil and honey—you set before them for a pleasing aroma; and so it was, declares the Lord GOD. </span>
<span class='v EK16_20' data-id='EK16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And you took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your whorings so small a matter </span>
<span class='v EK16_21' data-id='EK16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>that you slaughtered my children and delivered them up as an offering by fire to them? </span>
<span class='v EK16_22' data-id='EK16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And in all your abominations and your whorings you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, wallowing in your blood. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_23' data-id='EK16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>“And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord GOD), </span>
<span class='v EK16_24' data-id='EK16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>you built yourself a vaulted chamber and made yourself a lofty place in every square. </span>
<span class='v EK16_25' data-id='EK16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>At the head of every street you built your lofty place and made your beauty an abomination, offering yourself to any passerby and multiplying your whoring. </span>
<span class='v EK16_26' data-id='EK16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>You also played the whore with the Egyptians, your lustful neighbors, multiplying your whoring, to provoke me to anger. </span>
<span class='v EK16_27' data-id='EK16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Behold, therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and diminished your allotted portion and delivered you to the greed of your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your lewd behavior. </span>
<span class='v EK16_28' data-id='EK16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>You played the whore also with the Assyrians, because you were not satisfied; yes, you played the whore with them, and still you were not satisfied. </span>
<span class='v EK16_29' data-id='EK16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>You multiplied your whoring also with the trading land of Chaldea, and even with this you were not satisfied. </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_30' data-id='EK16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>“How lovesick is your heart, declares the Lord GOD, because you did all these things, the deeds of a brazen prostitute, </span>
<span class='v EK16_31' data-id='EK16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>building your vaulted chamber at the head of every street, and making your lofty place in every square. Yet you were not like a prostitute, because you scorned payment. </span>
<span class='v EK16_32' data-id='EK16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! </span>
<span class='v EK16_33' data-id='EK16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave your gifts to all your lovers, bribing them to come to you from every side with your whorings. </span>
<span class='v EK16_34' data-id='EK16_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>So you were different from other women in your whorings. No one solicited you to play the whore, and you gave payment, while no payment was given to you; therefore you were different. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EK16_35' data-id='EK16_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>“Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of the LORD: </span>
<span class='v EK16_36' data-id='EK16_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Thus says the Lord GOD, Because your lust was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your whorings with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children that you gave to them, </span>
<span class='v EK16_37' data-id='EK16_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>therefore, behold, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved and all those you hated. I will gather them against you from every side and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness. </span>
<span class='v EK16_38' data-id='EK16_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And I will judge you as women who commit adultery and shed blood are judged, and bring upon you the blood of wrath and jealousy. </span>
<span class='v EK16_39' data-id='EK16_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And I will give you into their hands, and they shall throw down your vaulted chamber and break down your lofty places. They shall strip you of your clothes and take your beautiful jewels and leave you naked and bare. </span>
<span class='v EK16_40' data-id='EK16_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>They shall bring up a crowd against you, and they shall stone you and cut you to pieces with their swords. </span>
<span class='v EK16_41' data-id='EK16_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And they shall burn your houses and execute judgments upon you in the sight of many women. I will make you stop playing the whore, and you shall also give payment no more. </span>
<span class='v EK16_42' data-id='EK16_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>So will I satisfy my wrath on you, and my jealousy shall depart from you. I will be calm and will no more be angry. </span>
<span class='v EK16_43' data-id='EK16_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have enraged me with all these things, therefore, behold, I have returned your deeds upon your head, declares the Lord GOD. “Have you not committed lewdness in addition to all your abominations? </span></div>

<span class='v EK16_44' data-id='EK16_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>“Behold, everyone who uses proverbs will use this proverb about you: ‘Like mother, like daughter.’ </span>
<span class='v EK16_45' data-id='EK16_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>You are the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their children.

<span class='v EK16_49' data-id='EK16_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>Behold, this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy. </span>
<span class='v EK16_50' data-id='EK16_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>They were haughty and did an abomination before me. So I removed them, when I saw it. </span>
<span class='v EK16_51' data-id='EK16_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>Samaria has not committed half your sins. You have committed more abominations than they, and have made your sisters appear righteous by all the abominations that you have committed. </span>
<span class='v EK16_52' data-id='EK16_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>Bear your disgrace, you also, for you have intervened on behalf of your sisters.
