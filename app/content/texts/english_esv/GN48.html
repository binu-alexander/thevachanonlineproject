<div class='s'>Jacob Blesses Ephraim and Manasseh </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_1' data-id='GN48_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this, Joseph was told, “Behold, your father is ill.” So he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. </span>
<span class='v GN48_2' data-id='GN48_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And it was told to Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed. </span>
<span class='v GN48_3' data-id='GN48_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me, </span>
<span class='v GN48_4' data-id='GN48_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting possession.’ </span>
<span class='v GN48_5' data-id='GN48_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are. </span>
<span class='v GN48_6' data-id='GN48_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And the children that you fathered after them shall be yours. They shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. </span>
<span class='v GN48_7' data-id='GN48_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>As for me, when I came from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath, and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_8' data-id='GN48_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, “Who are these?” </span>
<span class='v GN48_9' data-id='GN48_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” And he said, “Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.” </span>
<span class='v GN48_10' data-id='GN48_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him, and he kissed them and embraced them. </span>
<span class='v GN48_11' data-id='GN48_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face; and behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” </span>
<span class='v GN48_12' data-id='GN48_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN48_13' data-id='GN48_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him. </span>
<span class='v GN48_14' data-id='GN48_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, crossing his hands (for Manasseh was the firstborn). </span>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And he blessed Joseph and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_15' data-id='GN48_15'>the God who has been my shepherd all my life long to this day, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>and in them let my name be carried on, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN48_16' data-id='GN48_16'>and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN48_17' data-id='GN48_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him, and he took his father's hand to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. </span>
<span class='v GN48_18' data-id='GN48_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Joseph said to his father, “Not this way, my father; since this one is the firstborn, put your right hand on his head.” </span>
<span class='v GN48_19' data-id='GN48_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. Nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations.” </span>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>So he blessed them that day, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>“By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>‘God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GN48_20' data-id='GN48_20'>Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh. </span>
<span class='v GN48_21' data-id='GN48_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you again to the land of your fathers. </span>
<span class='v GN48_22' data-id='GN48_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Moreover, I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope that I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.” </span></div></div>
