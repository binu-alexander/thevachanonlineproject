<div class='s'>Rejoicing in Heaven </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_1' data-id='RV19_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_1' data-id='RV19_1'>“Hallelujah! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_1' data-id='RV19_1'>Salvation and glory and power belong to our God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_2' data-id='RV19_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>for his judgments are true and just; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_2' data-id='RV19_2'>for he has judged the great prostitute </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_2' data-id='RV19_2'>who corrupted the earth with her immorality, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_2' data-id='RV19_2'>and has avenged on her the blood of his servants.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_3' data-id='RV19_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Once more they cried out, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_3' data-id='RV19_3'>“Hallelujah! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_3' data-id='RV19_3'>The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV19_4' data-id='RV19_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, “Amen. Hallelujah!” </span>
<span class='v RV19_5' data-id='RV19_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And from the throne came a voice saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_5' data-id='RV19_5'>“Praise our God, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_5' data-id='RV19_5'>all you his servants, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_5' data-id='RV19_5'>you who fear him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_5' data-id='RV19_5'>small and great.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Marriage Supper of the Lamb </div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV19_6' data-id='RV19_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_6' data-id='RV19_6'>“Hallelujah! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_6' data-id='RV19_6'>For the Lord our God </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_6' data-id='RV19_6'>the Almighty reigns. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_7' data-id='RV19_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Let us rejoice and exult </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_7' data-id='RV19_7'>and give him the glory, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_7' data-id='RV19_7'>for the marriage of the Lamb has come, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_7' data-id='RV19_7'>and his Bride has made herself ready; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV19_8' data-id='RV19_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>it was granted her to clothe herself </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV19_8' data-id='RV19_8'>with fine linen, bright and pure”— </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV19_8' data-id='RV19_8'>for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_9' data-id='RV19_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.” </span>
<span class='v RV19_10' data-id='RV19_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God.” For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Rider on a White Horse </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_11' data-id='RV19_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. </span>
<span class='v RV19_12' data-id='RV19_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. </span>
<span class='v RV19_13' data-id='RV19_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God. </span>
<span class='v RV19_14' data-id='RV19_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. </span>
<span class='v RV19_15' data-id='RV19_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. </span>
<span class='v RV19_16' data-id='RV19_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV19_17' data-id='RV19_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, </span>
<span class='v RV19_18' data-id='RV19_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” </span>
<span class='v RV19_19' data-id='RV19_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. </span>
<span class='v RV19_20' data-id='RV19_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. </span>
<span class='v RV19_21' data-id='RV19_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh. </span></div></div>
