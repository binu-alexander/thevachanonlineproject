<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL2_1' data-id='CL2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face, </span>
<span class='v CL2_2' data-id='CL2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ, </span>
<span class='v CL2_3' data-id='CL2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. </span>
<span class='v CL2_4' data-id='CL2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments. </span>
<span class='v CL2_5' data-id='CL2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Alive in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL2_6' data-id='CL2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, </span>
<span class='v CL2_7' data-id='CL2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL2_8' data-id='CL2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. </span>
<span class='v CL2_9' data-id='CL2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily, </span>
<span class='v CL2_10' data-id='CL2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority. </span>
<span class='v CL2_11' data-id='CL2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, </span>
<span class='v CL2_12' data-id='CL2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. </span>
<span class='v CL2_13' data-id='CL2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, </span>
<span class='v CL2_14' data-id='CL2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross. </span>
<span class='v CL2_15' data-id='CL2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Let No One Disqualify You </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL2_16' data-id='CL2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. </span>
<span class='v CL2_17' data-id='CL2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ. </span>
<span class='v CL2_18' data-id='CL2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind, </span>
<span class='v CL2_19' data-id='CL2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v CL2_20' data-id='CL2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations— </span>
<span class='v CL2_21' data-id='CL2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>“Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch” </span>
<span class='v CL2_22' data-id='CL2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>(referring to things that all perish as they are used)—according to human precepts and teachings? </span>
<span class='v CL2_23' data-id='CL2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh. </span></div></div>
