<div class='s'>Paul and Barnabas at Iconium </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC14_1' data-id='AC14_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed. </span>
<span class='v AC14_2' data-id='AC14_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. </span>
<span class='v AC14_3' data-id='AC14_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. </span>
<span class='v AC14_4' data-id='AC14_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles. </span>
<span class='v AC14_5' data-id='AC14_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, </span>
<span class='v AC14_6' data-id='AC14_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country, </span>
<span class='v AC14_7' data-id='AC14_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and there they continued to preach the gospel. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul and Barnabas at Lystra </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC14_8' data-id='AC14_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked. </span>
<span class='v AC14_9' data-id='AC14_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, </span>
<span class='v AC14_10' data-id='AC14_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>said in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And he sprang up and began walking. </span>
<span class='v AC14_11' data-id='AC14_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, “The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!” </span>
<span class='v AC14_12' data-id='AC14_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. </span>
<span class='v AC14_13' data-id='AC14_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. </span>
<span class='v AC14_14' data-id='AC14_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, </span>
<span class='v AC14_15' data-id='AC14_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. </span>
<span class='v AC14_16' data-id='AC14_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. </span>
<span class='v AC14_17' data-id='AC14_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.” </span>
<span class='v AC14_18' data-id='AC14_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul Stoned at Lystra </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC14_19' data-id='AC14_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. </span>
<span class='v AC14_20' data-id='AC14_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. </span>
<span class='v AC14_21' data-id='AC14_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, </span>
<span class='v AC14_22' data-id='AC14_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. </span>
<span class='v AC14_23' data-id='AC14_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch in Syria </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC14_24' data-id='AC14_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. </span>
<span class='v AC14_25' data-id='AC14_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, </span>
<span class='v AC14_26' data-id='AC14_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled. </span>
<span class='v AC14_27' data-id='AC14_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. </span>
<span class='v AC14_28' data-id='AC14_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And they remained no little time with the disciples. </span></div></div>
