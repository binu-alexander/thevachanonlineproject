<div class='s'>A Vision of a Man with a Measuring Line </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC2_1' data-id='ZC2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand! </span>
<span class='v ZC2_2' data-id='ZC2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Then I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.” </span>
<span class='v ZC2_3' data-id='ZC2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him </span>
<span class='v ZC2_4' data-id='ZC2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and said to him, “Run, say to that young man, ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_5' data-id='ZC2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory in her midst.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v ZC2_6' data-id='ZC2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the LORD. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the LORD. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_7' data-id='ZC2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_8' data-id='ZC2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For thus said the LORD of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye: </span>
<span class='v ZC2_9' data-id='ZC2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>“Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the LORD of hosts has sent me. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_10' data-id='ZC2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the LORD. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_11' data-id='ZC2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. </span>
<span class='v ZC2_12' data-id='ZC2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the LORD will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.” </span></div>
