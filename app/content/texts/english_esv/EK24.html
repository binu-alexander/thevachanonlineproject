<span class='v EK24_6' data-id='EK24_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose corrosion is in it, and whose corrosion has not gone out of it! Take out of it piece after piece, without making any choice. </span>
<span class='v EK24_7' data-id='EK24_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For the blood she has shed is in her midst; she put it on the bare rock; she did not pour it out on the ground to cover it with dust. </span>
<span class='v EK24_8' data-id='EK24_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>To rouse my wrath, to take vengeance, I have set on the bare rock the blood she has shed, that it may not be covered. </span>

<span class='v EK24_18' data-id='EK24_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died. And on the next morning I did as I was commanded. </span></div>
