<div class='s'>Jesus Rejected at Nazareth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_1' data-id='MK6_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. </span>
<span class='v MK6_2' data-id='MK6_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? </span>
<span class='v MK6_3' data-id='MK6_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. </span>
<span class='v MK6_4' data-id='MK6_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_5' data-id='MK6_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. </span>
<span class='v MK6_6' data-id='MK6_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he marveled because of their unbelief. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_6' data-id='MK6_6'>And he went about among the villages teaching. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Sends Out the Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_7' data-id='MK6_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span> And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. </span>
<span class='v MK6_8' data-id='MK6_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts— </span>
<span class='v MK6_9' data-id='MK6_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. </span>
<span class='v MK6_10' data-id='MK6_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. </span>
<span class='v MK6_11' data-id='MK6_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_12' data-id='MK6_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. </span>
<span class='v MK6_13' data-id='MK6_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Death of John the Baptist </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_14' data-id='MK6_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span> King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_15' data-id='MK6_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_16' data-id='MK6_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_17' data-id='MK6_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. </span>
<span class='v MK6_18' data-id='MK6_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_19' data-id='MK6_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, </span>
<span class='v MK6_20' data-id='MK6_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_21' data-id='MK6_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. </span>
<span class='v MK6_22' data-id='MK6_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_23' data-id='MK6_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_24' data-id='MK6_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And she went out and said to her mother, “For what should I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_25' data-id='MK6_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_26' data-id='MK6_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. </span>
<span class='v MK6_27' data-id='MK6_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison </span>
<span class='v MK6_28' data-id='MK6_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. </span>
<span class='v MK6_29' data-id='MK6_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_30' data-id='MK6_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. </span>
<span class='v MK6_31' data-id='MK6_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. </span>
<span class='v MK6_32' data-id='MK6_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span> And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. </span>
<span class='v MK6_33' data-id='MK6_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. </span>
<span class='v MK6_34' data-id='MK6_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. </span>
<span class='v MK6_35' data-id='MK6_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. </span>
<span class='v MK6_36' data-id='MK6_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_37' data-id='MK6_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?” </span>
<span class='v MK6_38' data-id='MK6_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they had found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_39' data-id='MK6_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. </span>
<span class='v MK6_40' data-id='MK6_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. </span>
<span class='v MK6_41' data-id='MK6_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. </span>
<span class='v MK6_42' data-id='MK6_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>And they all ate and were satisfied. </span>
<span class='v MK6_43' data-id='MK6_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. </span>
<span class='v MK6_44' data-id='MK6_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Walks on the Water </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_45' data-id='MK6_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span> Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. </span>
<span class='v MK6_46' data-id='MK6_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. </span>
<span class='v MK6_47' data-id='MK6_47'><span class='v-num v-47'>47&nbsp;</span>And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. </span>
<span class='v MK6_48' data-id='MK6_48'><span class='v-num v-48'>48&nbsp;</span>And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, </span>
<span class='v MK6_49' data-id='MK6_49'><span class='v-num v-49'>49&nbsp;</span>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, </span>
<span class='v MK6_50' data-id='MK6_50'><span class='v-num v-50'>50&nbsp;</span>for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.” </span>
<span class='v MK6_51' data-id='MK6_51'><span class='v-num v-51'>51&nbsp;</span>And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, </span>
<span class='v MK6_52' data-id='MK6_52'><span class='v-num v-52'>52&nbsp;</span>for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals the Sick in Gennesaret </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK6_53' data-id='MK6_53'><span class='v-num v-53'>53&nbsp;</span> When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. </span>
<span class='v MK6_54' data-id='MK6_54'><span class='v-num v-54'>54&nbsp;</span>And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him </span>
<span class='v MK6_55' data-id='MK6_55'><span class='v-num v-55'>55&nbsp;</span>and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. </span>
<span class='v MK6_56' data-id='MK6_56'><span class='v-num v-56'>56&nbsp;</span>And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well. </span></div></div>
