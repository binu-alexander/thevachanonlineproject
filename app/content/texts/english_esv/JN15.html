<div class='s'>I Am the True Vine </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN15_1' data-id='JN15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser. </span>
<span class='v JN15_2' data-id='JN15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Every branch of mine that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. </span>
<span class='v JN15_3' data-id='JN15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_4' data-id='JN15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. </span>
<span class='v JN15_5' data-id='JN15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. </span>
<span class='v JN15_6' data-id='JN15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned. </span>
<span class='v JN15_7' data-id='JN15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_8' data-id='JN15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. </span>
<span class='v JN15_9' data-id='JN15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love. </span>
<span class='v JN15_10' data-id='JN15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love. </span>
<span class='v JN15_11' data-id='JN15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN15_12' data-id='JN15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_13' data-id='JN15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends. </span>
<span class='v JN15_14' data-id='JN15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>You are my friends if you do what I command you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_15' data-id='JN15_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_16' data-id='JN15_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_17' data-id='JN15_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>These things I command you, so that you will love one another. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Hatred of the World </div>

<span class='v JN15_18' data-id='JN15_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_19' data-id='JN15_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. </span>
<span class='v JN15_20' data-id='JN15_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Remember the word that I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. </span>
<span class='v JN15_21' data-id='JN15_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. </span>
<span class='v JN15_22' data-id='JN15_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. </span>
<span class='v JN15_23' data-id='JN15_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Whoever hates me hates my Father also. </span>
<span class='v JN15_24' data-id='JN15_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. </span>
<span class='v JN15_25' data-id='JN15_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: ‘They hated me without a cause.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN15_26' data-id='JN15_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>“But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. </span>
<span class='v JN15_27' data-id='JN15_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning. </span></div></div>
