<div class='s'>John the Baptist Prepares the Way </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_1' data-id='MT3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, </span>
<span class='v MT3_2' data-id='MT3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” </span>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>“The voice of one crying in the wilderness: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>‘Prepare the way of the Lord; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT3_3' data-id='MT3_3'>make his paths straight.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT3_4' data-id='MT3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. </span>
<span class='v MT3_5' data-id='MT3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, </span>
<span class='v MT3_6' data-id='MT3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_7' data-id='MT3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? </span>
<span class='v MT3_8' data-id='MT3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. </span>
<span class='v MT3_9' data-id='MT3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And do not presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. </span>
<span class='v MT3_10' data-id='MT3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_11' data-id='MT3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. </span>
<span class='v MT3_12' data-id='MT3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Baptism of Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT3_13' data-id='MT3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. </span>
<span class='v MT3_14' data-id='MT3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?” </span>
<span class='v MT3_15' data-id='MT3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented. </span>
<span class='v MT3_16' data-id='MT3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; </span>
<span class='v MT3_17' data-id='MT3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and behold, a voice from heaven said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.” </span></div></div>
