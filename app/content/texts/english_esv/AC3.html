<div class='s'>The Lame Beggar Healed </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC3_1' data-id='AC3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. </span>
<span class='v AC3_2' data-id='AC3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. </span>
<span class='v AC3_3' data-id='AC3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. </span>
<span class='v AC3_4' data-id='AC3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, “Look at us.” </span>
<span class='v AC3_5' data-id='AC3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. </span>
<span class='v AC3_6' data-id='AC3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Peter said, “I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!” </span>
<span class='v AC3_7' data-id='AC3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. </span>
<span class='v AC3_8' data-id='AC3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. </span>
<span class='v AC3_9' data-id='AC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And all the people saw him walking and praising God, </span>
<span class='v AC3_10' data-id='AC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Peter Speaks in Solomon's Portico </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC3_11' data-id='AC3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>While he clung to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's, astounded. </span>
<span class='v AC3_12' data-id='AC3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: “Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? </span>
<span class='v AC3_13' data-id='AC3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. </span>
<span class='v AC3_14' data-id='AC3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, </span>
<span class='v AC3_15' data-id='AC3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. </span>
<span class='v AC3_16' data-id='AC3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And his name—by faith in his name—has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC3_17' data-id='AC3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. </span>
<span class='v AC3_18' data-id='AC3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. </span>
<span class='v AC3_19' data-id='AC3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, </span>
<span class='v AC3_20' data-id='AC3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, </span>
<span class='v AC3_21' data-id='AC3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. </span>
<span class='v AC3_22' data-id='AC3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Moses said, ‘The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. </span>
<span class='v AC3_23' data-id='AC3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.’ </span>
<span class='v AC3_24' data-id='AC3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. </span>
<span class='v AC3_25' data-id='AC3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’ </span>
<span class='v AC3_26' data-id='AC3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness.” </span></div></div>
