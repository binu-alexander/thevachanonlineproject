<span class='v JN16_2' data-id='JN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>They will put you out of the synagogues. Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God. </span>
<span class='v JN16_3' data-id='JN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me. </span>
<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But I have said these things to you, that when their hour comes you may remember that I told them to you. </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_4' data-id='JN16_4'>“I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_5' data-id='JN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ </span>
<span class='v JN16_6' data-id='JN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. </span>
<span class='v JN16_7' data-id='JN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_8' data-id='JN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: </span>
<span class='v JN16_9' data-id='JN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; </span>
<span class='v JN16_10' data-id='JN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; </span>
<span class='v JN16_11' data-id='JN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged. </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_12' data-id='JN16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. </span>
<span class='v JN16_13' data-id='JN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. </span>
<span class='v JN16_14' data-id='JN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_15' data-id='JN16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you. </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_16' data-id='JN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“A little while, and you will see me no longer; and again a little while, and you will see me.” </span>
<span class='v JN16_17' data-id='JN16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me’; and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?” </span>
<span class='v JN16_18' data-id='JN16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So they were saying, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We do not know what he is talking about.” </span>
<span class='v JN16_19' data-id='JN16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, “Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by saying, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’? </span>
<span class='v JN16_20' data-id='JN16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. </span>
<span class='v JN16_21' data-id='JN16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. </span>
<span class='v JN16_22' data-id='JN16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_23' data-id='JN16_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. </span>
<span class='v JN16_24' data-id='JN16_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full. </span></div>

<span class='v JN16_25' data-id='JN16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“I have said these things to you in figures of speech. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech but will tell you plainly about the Father. </span>
<span class='v JN16_26' data-id='JN16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf; </span>
<span class='v JN16_27' data-id='JN16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God. </span>
<span class='v JN16_28' data-id='JN16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>I came from the Father and have come into the world, and now I am leaving the world and going to the Father.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN16_29' data-id='JN16_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>His disciples said, “Ah, now you are speaking plainly and not using figurative speech! </span>
<span class='v JN16_30' data-id='JN16_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Now we know that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you; this is why we believe that you came from God.” </span>
<span class='v JN16_31' data-id='JN16_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, “Do you now believe? </span>
<span class='v JN16_32' data-id='JN16_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Behold, the hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be scattered, each to his own home, and will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. </span>
<span class='v JN16_33' data-id='JN16_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” </span></div></div>
