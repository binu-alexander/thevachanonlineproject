<div class='s'>The Parable of the Ten Virgins </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT25_1' data-id='MT25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. </span>
<span class='v MT25_2' data-id='MT25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. </span>
<span class='v MT25_3' data-id='MT25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, </span>
<span class='v MT25_4' data-id='MT25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. </span>
<span class='v MT25_5' data-id='MT25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. </span>
<span class='v MT25_6' data-id='MT25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_7' data-id='MT25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. </span>
<span class='v MT25_8' data-id='MT25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_9' data-id='MT25_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_10' data-id='MT25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. </span>
<span class='v MT25_11' data-id='MT25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_12' data-id='MT25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_13' data-id='MT25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Parable of the Talents </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT25_14' data-id='MT25_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. </span>
<span class='v MT25_15' data-id='MT25_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. </span>
<span class='v MT25_16' data-id='MT25_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_17' data-id='MT25_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. </span>
<span class='v MT25_18' data-id='MT25_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. </span>
<span class='v MT25_19' data-id='MT25_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. </span>
<span class='v MT25_20' data-id='MT25_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_21' data-id='MT25_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_22' data-id='MT25_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_23' data-id='MT25_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_24' data-id='MT25_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, </span>
<span class='v MT25_25' data-id='MT25_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_26' data-id='MT25_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? </span>
<span class='v MT25_27' data-id='MT25_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. </span>
<span class='v MT25_28' data-id='MT25_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. </span>
<span class='v MT25_29' data-id='MT25_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. </span>
<span class='v MT25_30' data-id='MT25_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Final Judgment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT25_31' data-id='MT25_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>“When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. </span>
<span class='v MT25_32' data-id='MT25_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. </span>
<span class='v MT25_33' data-id='MT25_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. </span>
<span class='v MT25_34' data-id='MT25_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. </span>
<span class='v MT25_35' data-id='MT25_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, </span>
<span class='v MT25_36' data-id='MT25_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_37' data-id='MT25_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? </span>
<span class='v MT25_38' data-id='MT25_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? </span>
<span class='v MT25_39' data-id='MT25_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_40' data-id='MT25_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT25_41' data-id='MT25_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. </span>
<span class='v MT25_42' data-id='MT25_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, </span>
<span class='v MT25_43' data-id='MT25_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_44' data-id='MT25_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_45' data-id='MT25_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ </span>
<span class='v MT25_46' data-id='MT25_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.” </span></div></div>
