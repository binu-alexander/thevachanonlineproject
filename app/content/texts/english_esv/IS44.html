<div class='s'>The Folly of Idolatry </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS44_9' data-id='IS44_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>All who fashion idols are nothing, and the things they delight in do not profit. Their witnesses neither see nor know, that they may be put to shame. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS44_12' data-id='IS44_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The ironsmith takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals. He fashions it with hammers and works it with his strong arm. He becomes hungry, and his strength fails; he drinks no water and is faint. </span>
<span class='v IS44_13' data-id='IS44_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The carpenter stretches a line; he marks it out with a pencil. He shapes it with planes and marks it with a compass. He shapes it into the figure of a man, with the beauty of a man, to dwell in a house. </span>
<span class='v IS44_14' data-id='IS44_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>He cuts down cedars, or he chooses a cypress tree or an oak and lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest. He plants a cedar and the rain nourishes it. </span>
<span class='v IS44_15' data-id='IS44_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then it becomes fuel for a man. He takes a part of it and warms himself; he kindles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a god and worships it; he makes it an idol and falls down before it. </span>
<span class='v IS44_16' data-id='IS44_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Half of it he burns in the fire. Over the half he eats meat; he roasts it and is satisfied. Also he warms himself and says, “Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire!” </span>
<span class='v IS44_17' data-id='IS44_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the rest of it he makes into a god, his idol, and falls down to it and worships it. He prays to it and says, “Deliver me, for you are my god!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS44_18' data-id='IS44_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They know not, nor do they discern, for he has shut their eyes, so that they cannot see, and their hearts, so that they cannot understand. </span>
<span class='v IS44_19' data-id='IS44_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>No one considers, nor is there knowledge or discernment to say, “Half of it I burned in the fire; I also baked bread on its coals; I roasted meat and have eaten. And shall I make the rest of it an abomination? Shall I fall down before a block of wood?” </span>
<span class='v IS44_20' data-id='IS44_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>He feeds on ashes; a deluded heart has led him astray, and he cannot deliver himself or say, “Is there not a lie in my right hand?” </span></div>
