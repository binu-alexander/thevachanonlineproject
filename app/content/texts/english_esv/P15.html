<div class='s'>Shepherd the Flock of God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P15_1' data-id='P15_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed: </span>
<span class='v P15_2' data-id='P15_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; </span>
<span class='v P15_3' data-id='P15_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. </span>
<span class='v P15_4' data-id='P15_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. </span>
<span class='v P15_5' data-id='P15_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P15_6' data-id='P15_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, </span>
<span class='v P15_7' data-id='P15_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. </span>
<span class='v P15_8' data-id='P15_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. </span>
<span class='v P15_9' data-id='P15_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. </span>
<span class='v P15_10' data-id='P15_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. </span>
<span class='v P15_11' data-id='P15_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Final Greetings </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P15_12' data-id='P15_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. </span>
<span class='v P15_13' data-id='P15_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son. </span>
<span class='v P15_14' data-id='P15_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Greet one another with the kiss of love. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v P15_14' data-id='P15_14'>Peace to all of you who are in Christ. </span></div></div>
