<div class='s'>Daniel's Vision of the Four Beasts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DN7_1' data-id='DN7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. </span>
<span class='v DN7_2' data-id='DN7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Daniel declared, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. </span>
<span class='v DN7_3' data-id='DN7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. </span>
<span class='v DN7_4' data-id='DN7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. </span>
<span class='v DN7_5' data-id='DN7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ </span>
<span class='v DN7_6' data-id='DN7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. </span>
<span class='v DN7_7' data-id='DN7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. </span>
<span class='v DN7_8' data-id='DN7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ancient of Days Reigns </div>

<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As I looked, </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>thrones were placed, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>and the Ancient of days took his seat; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>his clothing was white as snow, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>and the hair of his head like pure wool; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>his throne was fiery flames; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>its wheels were burning fire. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>A stream of fire issued </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>a thousand thousands served him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>the court sat in judgment, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>and the books were opened. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DN7_11' data-id='DN7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. </span>
<span class='v DN7_12' data-id='DN7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_13' data-id='DN7_13'>and behold, with the clouds of heaven </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_13' data-id='DN7_13'>there came one like a son of man, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_13' data-id='DN7_13'>and he came to the Ancient of Days </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_13' data-id='DN7_13'>and was presented before him. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_14' data-id='DN7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And to him was given dominion </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_16' data-id='DN7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things. </span>

<span class='v DN7_19' data-id='DN7_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>“Then I desired to know the truth about the fourth beast, which was different from all the rest, exceedingly terrifying, with its teeth of iron and claws of bronze, and which devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet, </span>

<span class='v DN7_21' data-id='DN7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, </span>
<span class='v DN7_22' data-id='DN7_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>until the Ancient of Days came, and judgment was given for the saints of the Most High, and the time came when the saints possessed the kingdom. </span></div>
