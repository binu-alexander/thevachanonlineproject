<div class='s'>Daniel's Vision of the Four Beasts </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DN7_1' data-id='DN7_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter. </span>
<span class='v DN7_2' data-id='DN7_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Daniel declared, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the four winds of heaven were stirring up the great sea. </span>
<span class='v DN7_3' data-id='DN7_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And four great beasts came up out of the sea, different from one another. </span>
<span class='v DN7_4' data-id='DN7_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The first was like a lion and had eagles' wings. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and the mind of a man was given to it. </span>
<span class='v DN7_5' data-id='DN7_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And behold, another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’ </span>
<span class='v DN7_6' data-id='DN7_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>After this I looked, and behold, another, like a leopard, with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and dominion was given to it. </span>
<span class='v DN7_7' data-id='DN7_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a fourth beast, terrifying and dreadful and exceedingly strong. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten horns. </span>
<span class='v DN7_8' data-id='DN7_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Ancient of Days Reigns </div>

<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>As I looked, </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'></span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>thrones were placed, </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>and the Ancient of days took his seat; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>his clothing was white as snow, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>and the hair of his head like pure wool; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>his throne was fiery flames; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_9' data-id='DN7_9'>its wheels were burning fire. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>A stream of fire issued </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>a thousand thousands served him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>the court sat in judgment, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_10' data-id='DN7_10'>and the books were opened. </span></div>
<div class='b'> &nbsp; </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v DN7_11' data-id='DN7_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was killed, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire. </span>
<span class='v DN7_12' data-id='DN7_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time. </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v DN7_13' data-id='DN7_13'>there came one like a son of man, </span></div>

<div class='q'>
<span class='v DN7_14' data-id='DN7_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And to him was given dominion </span></div>

<span class='v DN7_16' data-id='DN7_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>I approached one of those who stood there and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me and made known to me the interpretation of the things. </span>

<span class='v DN7_21' data-id='DN7_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>As I looked, this horn made war with the saints and prevailed over them, </span>
