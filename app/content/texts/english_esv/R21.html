<span class='v R21_3' data-id='R21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there. </span>
<span class='v R21_4' data-id='R21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>(But David had brought up the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.) </span>
<span class='v R21_5' data-id='R21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Moreover, the bronze altar that Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly resorted to it. </span>
<span class='v R21_6' data-id='R21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it. </span></div>

<span class='v R21_7' data-id='R21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, “Ask what I shall give you.” </span>
<span class='v R21_8' data-id='R21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Solomon said to God, “You have shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and have made me king in his place. </span>
<span class='v R21_9' data-id='R21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>O LORD God, let your word to David my father be now fulfilled, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. </span>
<span class='v R21_10' data-id='R21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can govern this people of yours, which is so great?” </span>
<span class='v R21_11' data-id='R21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>God answered Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may govern my people over whom I have made you king, </span>
<span class='v R21_12' data-id='R21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like.” </span>
<span class='v R21_13' data-id='R21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel. </span></div>

<span class='v R21_15' data-id='R21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. </span>
