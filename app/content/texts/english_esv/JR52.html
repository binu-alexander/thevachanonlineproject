<div class='s'>The Fall of Jerusalem Recounted </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_1' data-id='JR52_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_2' data-id='JR52_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </span>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For because of the anger of the LORD things came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_3' data-id='JR52_3'>And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR52_4' data-id='JR52_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it. </span>
<span class='v JR52_5' data-id='JR52_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_6' data-id='JR52_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land. </span>
<span class='v JR52_7' data-id='JR52_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, while the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_8' data-id='JR52_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. And all his army was scattered from him. </span>
<span class='v JR52_9' data-id='JR52_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him. </span>
<span class='v JR52_10' data-id='JR52_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at Riblah. </span>
<span class='v JR52_11' data-id='JR52_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. </span></div>

<span class='v JR52_12' data-id='JR52_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month—that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR52_13' data-id='JR52_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down. </span>
<span class='v JR52_14' data-id='JR52_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. </span>
<span class='v JR52_15' data-id='JR52_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans. </span>
<span class='v JR52_16' data-id='JR52_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR52_17' data-id='JR52_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon. </span>
<span class='v JR52_18' data-id='JR52_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And they took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service; </span>

<span class='v JR52_25' data-id='JR52_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city. </span>
<span class='v JR52_26' data-id='JR52_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. </span>
