<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC3_9' data-id='EC3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What gain has the worker from his toil? </span>
<span class='v EC3_10' data-id='EC3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. </span>
<span class='v EC3_11' data-id='EC3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. </span>
<span class='v EC3_12' data-id='EC3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; </span>
<span class='v EC3_13' data-id='EC3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil—this is God's gift to man. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC3_14' data-id='EC3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him. </span>
<span class='v EC3_15' data-id='EC3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>That which is, already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God seeks what has been driven away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>From Dust to Dust </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EC3_16' data-id='EC3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Moreover, I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness. </span>
<span class='v EC3_17' data-id='EC3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and for every work. </span>
<span class='v EC3_18' data-id='EC3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts. </span>
<span class='v EC3_19' data-id='EC3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity. </span>
<span class='v EC3_20' data-id='EC3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return. </span>
<span class='v EC3_21' data-id='EC3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth? </span>
<span class='v EC3_22' data-id='EC3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot. Who can bring him to see what will be after him? </span></div></div>
