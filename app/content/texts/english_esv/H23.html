<span class='v H23_1' data-id='H23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored, as happened among you, </span>
<span class='v H23_2' data-id='H23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For not all have faith. </span>
<span class='v H23_3' data-id='H23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one. </span>
<span class='v H23_4' data-id='H23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command. </span>

<span class='v H23_6' data-id='H23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us. </span>
<span class='v H23_7' data-id='H23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you, </span>
<span class='v H23_8' data-id='H23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you. </span>
<span class='v H23_9' data-id='H23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate. </span>
<span class='v H23_10' data-id='H23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. </span>
<span class='v H23_11' data-id='H23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies. </span>
<span class='v H23_12' data-id='H23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living. </span></div>

<span class='v H23_13' data-id='H23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. </span>
<span class='v H23_14' data-id='H23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. </span>
<span class='v H23_15' data-id='H23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Benediction </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v H23_16' data-id='H23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all. </span></div>
