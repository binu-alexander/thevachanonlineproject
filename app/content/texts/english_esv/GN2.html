<div class='s'>The Seventh Day, God Rests </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN2_1' data-id='GN2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. </span>
<span class='v GN2_2' data-id='GN2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. </span>
<span class='v GN2_3' data-id='GN2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Creation of Man and Woman </div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN2_4' data-id='GN2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>These are the generations </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN2_4' data-id='GN2_4'>of the heavens and the earth when they were created, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN2_4' data-id='GN2_4'>in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN2_5' data-id='GN2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, </span>
<span class='v GN2_6' data-id='GN2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground— </span>
<span class='v GN2_7' data-id='GN2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. </span>
<span class='v GN2_8' data-id='GN2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. </span>
<span class='v GN2_9' data-id='GN2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN2_10' data-id='GN2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. </span>
<span class='v GN2_11' data-id='GN2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. </span>
<span class='v GN2_12' data-id='GN2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. </span>
<span class='v GN2_13' data-id='GN2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. </span>
<span class='v GN2_14' data-id='GN2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN2_15' data-id='GN2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. </span>
<span class='v GN2_16' data-id='GN2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, </span>
<span class='v GN2_17' data-id='GN2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN2_18' data-id='GN2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then the LORD God said, “It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him.” </span>
<span class='v GN2_19' data-id='GN2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name. </span>
<span class='v GN2_20' data-id='GN2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>The man gave names to all livestock and to the birds of the heavens and to every beast of the field. But for Adam there was not found a helper fit for him. </span>
<span class='v GN2_21' data-id='GN2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. </span>
<span class='v GN2_22' data-id='GN2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. </span>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then the man said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'>“This at last is bone of my bones </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'>and flesh of my flesh; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'>she shall be called Woman, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN2_23' data-id='GN2_23'>because she was taken out of Man.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GN2_24' data-id='GN2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. </span>
<span class='v GN2_25' data-id='GN2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed. </span></div></div>
