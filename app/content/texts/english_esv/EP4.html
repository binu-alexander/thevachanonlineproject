<div class='s'>Unity in the Body of Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP4_1' data-id='EP4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, </span>
<span class='v EP4_2' data-id='EP4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, </span>
<span class='v EP4_3' data-id='EP4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. </span>
<span class='v EP4_4' data-id='EP4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>There is one body and one Spirit—just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call— </span>
<span class='v EP4_5' data-id='EP4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>one Lord, one faith, one baptism, </span>
<span class='v EP4_6' data-id='EP4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. </span>
<span class='v EP4_7' data-id='EP4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift. </span>
<span class='v EP4_8' data-id='EP4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore it says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v EP4_8' data-id='EP4_8'>“When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v EP4_8' data-id='EP4_8'>and he gave gifts to men.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v EP4_9' data-id='EP4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>(In saying, “He ascended,” what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth? </span>
<span class='v EP4_10' data-id='EP4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.) </span>
<span class='v EP4_11' data-id='EP4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, </span>
<span class='v EP4_12' data-id='EP4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP4_13' data-id='EP4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP4_14' data-id='EP4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes. </span>
<span class='v EP4_15' data-id='EP4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, </span>
<span class='v EP4_16' data-id='EP4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The New Life </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP4_17' data-id='EP4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. </span>
<span class='v EP4_18' data-id='EP4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart. </span>
<span class='v EP4_19' data-id='EP4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity. </span>
<span class='v EP4_20' data-id='EP4_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But that is not the way you learned Christ!— </span>
<span class='v EP4_21' data-id='EP4_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus, </span>
<span class='v EP4_22' data-id='EP4_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires, </span>
<span class='v EP4_23' data-id='EP4_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, </span>
<span class='v EP4_24' data-id='EP4_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP4_25' data-id='EP4_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another. </span>
<span class='v EP4_26' data-id='EP4_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, </span>
<span class='v EP4_27' data-id='EP4_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and give no opportunity to the devil. </span>
<span class='v EP4_28' data-id='EP4_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. </span>
<span class='v EP4_29' data-id='EP4_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. </span>
<span class='v EP4_30' data-id='EP4_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. </span>
<span class='v EP4_31' data-id='EP4_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. </span>
<span class='v EP4_32' data-id='EP4_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you. </span></div></div>
