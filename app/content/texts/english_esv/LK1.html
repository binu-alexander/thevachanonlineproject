<span class='v LK1_3' data-id='LK1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, </span>

<div class='s'>Birth of John the Baptist Foretold </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_5' data-id='LK1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, of the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_6' data-id='LK1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And they were both righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord. </span>
<span class='v LK1_7' data-id='LK1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in years. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_8' data-id='LK1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now while he was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, </span>
<span class='v LK1_9' data-id='LK1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense. </span>
<span class='v LK1_10' data-id='LK1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense. </span>
<span class='v LK1_11' data-id='LK1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. </span>
<span class='v LK1_12' data-id='LK1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. </span>
<span class='v LK1_13' data-id='LK1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. </span>
<span class='v LK1_14' data-id='LK1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth, </span>
<span class='v LK1_15' data-id='LK1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>for he will be great before the Lord. And he must not drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. </span>
<span class='v LK1_16' data-id='LK1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God, </span>
<span class='v LK1_17' data-id='LK1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_18' data-id='LK1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And Zechariah said to the angel, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.” </span>
<span class='v LK1_19' data-id='LK1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And the angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. </span>
<span class='v LK1_20' data-id='LK1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.” </span>
<span class='v LK1_21' data-id='LK1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in the temple. </span>
<span class='v LK1_22' data-id='LK1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them and remained mute. </span>
<span class='v LK1_23' data-id='LK1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And when his time of service was ended, he went to his home. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_24' data-id='LK1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying, </span>
<span class='v LK1_25' data-id='LK1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Birth of Jesus Foretold </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_26' data-id='LK1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, </span>
<span class='v LK1_27' data-id='LK1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. </span>
<span class='v LK1_28' data-id='LK1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he came to her and said, “Greetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!” </span>
<span class='v LK1_29' data-id='LK1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. </span>
<span class='v LK1_30' data-id='LK1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_31' data-id='LK1_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. </span>
<span class='v LK1_32' data-id='LK1_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, </span>
<span class='v LK1_33' data-id='LK1_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_34' data-id='LK1_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_35' data-id='LK1_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And the angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy—the Son of God. </span>
<span class='v LK1_36' data-id='LK1_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. </span>
<span class='v LK1_37' data-id='LK1_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>For nothing will be impossible with God.” </span>
<span class='v LK1_38' data-id='LK1_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Mary Visits Elizabeth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_39' data-id='LK1_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, </span>
<span class='v LK1_40' data-id='LK1_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. </span>
<span class='v LK1_41' data-id='LK1_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, </span>
<span class='v LK1_42' data-id='LK1_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>and she ex claimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! </span>
<span class='v LK1_43' data-id='LK1_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? </span>
<span class='v LK1_44' data-id='LK1_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. </span>
<span class='v LK1_45' data-id='LK1_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Magnificat </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v LK1_46' data-id='LK1_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And Mary said, </span></div>

<span class='v LK1_59' data-id='LK1_59'><span class='v-num v-59'>59&nbsp;</span>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, </span>
