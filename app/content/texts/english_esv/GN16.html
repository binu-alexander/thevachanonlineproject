<div class='s'>Sarai and Hagar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_1' data-id='GN16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. </span>
<span class='v GN16_2' data-id='GN16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And Sarai said to Abram, “Behold now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Go in to my servant; it may be that I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai. </span>
<span class='v GN16_3' data-id='GN16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife. </span>
<span class='v GN16_4' data-id='GN16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress. </span>
<span class='v GN16_5' data-id='GN16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant to your embrace, and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me!” </span>
<span class='v GN16_6' data-id='GN16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your servant is in your power; do to her as you please.” Then Sarai dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_7' data-id='GN16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, the spring on the way to Shur. </span>
<span class='v GN16_8' data-id='GN16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_9' data-id='GN16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>The angel of the LORD said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_10' data-id='GN16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The angel of the LORD also said to her, “I will surely multiply your offspring so that they cannot be numbered for multitude.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD said to her, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'>“Behold, you are pregnant </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'>and shall bear a son. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'>You shall call his name Ishmael, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN16_11' data-id='GN16_11'>because the LORD has listened to your affliction. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN16_12' data-id='GN16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He shall be a wild donkey of a man, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN16_12' data-id='GN16_12'>his hand against everyone </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN16_12' data-id='GN16_12'>and everyone's hand against him, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN16_12' data-id='GN16_12'>and he shall dwell over against all his kinsmen.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v GN16_13' data-id='GN16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>So she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are a God of seeing,” for she said, “Truly here I have seen him who looks after me.” </span>
<span class='v GN16_14' data-id='GN16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it lies between Kadesh and Bered. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN16_15' data-id='GN16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bore, Ishmael. </span>
<span class='v GN16_16' data-id='GN16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram. </span></div></div>
