<div class='s'>Exhortation, Encouragement, and Prayer </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_2' data-id='PP4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v PP4_3' data-id='PP4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women, who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_4' data-id='PP4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice. </span>
<span class='v PP4_5' data-id='PP4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; </span>
<span class='v PP4_6' data-id='PP4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. </span>
<span class='v PP4_7' data-id='PP4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP4_8' data-id='PP4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. </span>
<span class='v PP4_9' data-id='PP4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me—practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. </span></div>

<span class='v PP4_10' data-id='PP4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. </span>
<span class='v PP4_11' data-id='PP4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. </span>
<span class='v PP4_12' data-id='PP4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. </span>

<span class='v PP4_14' data-id='PP4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble. </span>
<span class='v PP4_15' data-id='PP4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only. </span>
<span class='v PP4_16' data-id='PP4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again. </span>
<span class='v PP4_17' data-id='PP4_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit. </span>
<span class='v PP4_18' data-id='PP4_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. </span>
<span class='v PP4_19' data-id='PP4_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus. </span>
