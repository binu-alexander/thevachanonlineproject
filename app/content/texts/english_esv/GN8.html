<div class='s'>The Flood Subsides </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN8_1' data-id='GN8_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>But God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the livestock that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided. </span>
<span class='v GN8_2' data-id='GN8_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>The fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained, </span>
<span class='v GN8_3' data-id='GN8_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and the waters receded from the earth continually. At the end of 150 days the waters had abated, </span>
<span class='v GN8_4' data-id='GN8_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. </span>
<span class='v GN8_5' data-id='GN8_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN8_6' data-id='GN8_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made </span>
<span class='v GN8_7' data-id='GN8_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>and sent forth a raven. It went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN8_8' data-id='GN8_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. </span>
<span class='v GN8_9' data-id='GN8_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took her and brought her into the ark with him. </span>
<span class='v GN8_10' data-id='GN8_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>He waited another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. </span>
<span class='v GN8_11' data-id='GN8_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the dove came back to him in the evening, and behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. </span>
<span class='v GN8_12' data-id='GN8_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then he waited another seven days and sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him anymore. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN8_13' data-id='GN8_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of the ground was dry. </span>
<span class='v GN8_14' data-id='GN8_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth had dried out. </span>
<span class='v GN8_15' data-id='GN8_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then God said to Noah, </span>
<span class='v GN8_16' data-id='GN8_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>“Go out from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you. </span>
<span class='v GN8_17' data-id='GN8_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh—birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth—that they may swarm on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” </span>
<span class='v GN8_18' data-id='GN8_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So Noah went out, and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him. </span>
<span class='v GN8_19' data-id='GN8_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out by families from the ark. </span></div>
<div class='s'>God's Covenant with Noah </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN8_20' data-id='GN8_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Noah built an altar to the LORD and took some of every clean animal and some of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. </span>
<span class='v GN8_21' data-id='GN8_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And when the LORD smelled the pleasing aroma, the LORD said in his heart, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intention of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I ever again strike down every living creature as I have done. </span>
<span class='v GN8_22' data-id='GN8_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.” </span></div></div>
