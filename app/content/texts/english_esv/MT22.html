<div class='s'>The Parable of the Wedding Feast </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_1' data-id='MT22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, </span>
<span class='v MT22_2' data-id='MT22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, </span>
<span class='v MT22_3' data-id='MT22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. </span>
<span class='v MT22_4' data-id='MT22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.’ </span>
<span class='v MT22_5' data-id='MT22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, </span>
<span class='v MT22_6' data-id='MT22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span>
<span class='v MT22_7' data-id='MT22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. </span>
<span class='v MT22_8' data-id='MT22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. </span>
<span class='v MT22_9' data-id='MT22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ </span>
<span class='v MT22_10' data-id='MT22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_11' data-id='MT22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. </span>
<span class='v MT22_12' data-id='MT22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless. </span>
<span class='v MT22_13' data-id='MT22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’ </span>
<span class='v MT22_14' data-id='MT22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For many are called, but few are chosen.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Paying Taxes to Caesar </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_15' data-id='MT22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span> Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his talk. </span>
<span class='v MT22_16' data-id='MT22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. </span>
<span class='v MT22_17' data-id='MT22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” </span>
<span class='v MT22_18' data-id='MT22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? </span>
<span class='v MT22_19' data-id='MT22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Show me the coin for the tax.” And they brought him a denarius. </span>
<span class='v MT22_20' data-id='MT22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And Jesus said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” </span>
<span class='v MT22_21' data-id='MT22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>They said, “Caesar's.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” </span>
<span class='v MT22_22' data-id='MT22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Sadducees Ask About the Resurrection </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_23' data-id='MT22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, </span>
<span class='v MT22_24' data-id='MT22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.’ </span>
<span class='v MT22_25' data-id='MT22_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. </span>
<span class='v MT22_26' data-id='MT22_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>So too the second and third, down to the seventh. </span>
<span class='v MT22_27' data-id='MT22_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>After them all, the woman died. </span>
<span class='v MT22_28' data-id='MT22_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_29' data-id='MT22_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>But Jesus answered them, “You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. </span>
<span class='v MT22_30' data-id='MT22_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. </span>
<span class='v MT22_31' data-id='MT22_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: </span>
<span class='v MT22_32' data-id='MT22_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not God of the dead, but of the living.” </span>
<span class='v MT22_33' data-id='MT22_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Great Commandment </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_34' data-id='MT22_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span> But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. </span>
<span class='v MT22_35' data-id='MT22_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. </span>
<span class='v MT22_36' data-id='MT22_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” </span>
<span class='v MT22_37' data-id='MT22_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. </span>
<span class='v MT22_38' data-id='MT22_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>This is the great and first commandment. </span>
<span class='v MT22_39' data-id='MT22_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. </span>
<span class='v MT22_40' data-id='MT22_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Whose Son Is the Christ? </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT22_41' data-id='MT22_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, </span>
<span class='v MT22_42' data-id='MT22_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “The son of David.” </span>
<span class='v MT22_43' data-id='MT22_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT22_44' data-id='MT22_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span> “ ‘The Lord said to my Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v MT22_44' data-id='MT22_44'>Sit at my right hand, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v MT22_44' data-id='MT22_44'>until I put your enemies under your feet’? </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v MT22_45' data-id='MT22_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?” </span>
<span class='v MT22_46' data-id='MT22_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions. </span></div></div>
