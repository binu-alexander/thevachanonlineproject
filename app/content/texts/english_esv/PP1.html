<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='s'>Greeting </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_1' data-id='PP1_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_1' data-id='PP1_1'>To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons: </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_2' data-id='PP1_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Thanksgiving and Prayer </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_3' data-id='PP1_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, </span>
<span class='v PP1_4' data-id='PP1_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, </span>
<span class='v PP1_5' data-id='PP1_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. </span>
<span class='v PP1_6' data-id='PP1_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP1_7' data-id='PP1_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP1_8' data-id='PP1_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v PP1_9' data-id='PP1_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, </span>
<span class='v PP1_10' data-id='PP1_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, </span>
<span class='v PP1_11' data-id='PP1_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Advance of the Gospel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_12' data-id='PP1_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel, </span>
<span class='v PP1_13' data-id='PP1_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ. </span>
<span class='v PP1_14' data-id='PP1_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_15' data-id='PP1_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will. </span>
<span class='v PP1_16' data-id='PP1_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. </span>
<span class='v PP1_17' data-id='PP1_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment. </span>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. </span></div>
<div class='s'>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'>To Live Is Christ </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_18' data-id='PP1_18'>Yes, and I will rejoice, </span>
<span class='v PP1_19' data-id='PP1_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, </span>
<span class='v PP1_20' data-id='PP1_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. </span>
<span class='v PP1_21' data-id='PP1_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. </span>
<span class='v PP1_22' data-id='PP1_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. </span>
<span class='v PP1_23' data-id='PP1_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. </span>
<span class='v PP1_24' data-id='PP1_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. </span>
<span class='v PP1_25' data-id='PP1_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, </span>
<span class='v PP1_26' data-id='PP1_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v PP1_27' data-id='PP1_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, </span>
<span class='v PP1_28' data-id='PP1_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. </span>
<span class='v PP1_29' data-id='PP1_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, </span>
<span class='v PP1_30' data-id='PP1_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have. </span></div></div>
