<div class='s'>Peter Reports to the Church </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_1' data-id='AC11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. </span>
<span class='v AC11_2' data-id='AC11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, </span>
<span class='v AC11_3' data-id='AC11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.” </span>
<span class='v AC11_4' data-id='AC11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But Peter began and explained it to them in order: </span>
<span class='v AC11_5' data-id='AC11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. </span>
<span class='v AC11_6' data-id='AC11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. </span>
<span class='v AC11_7' data-id='AC11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Rise, Peter; kill and eat.’ </span>
<span class='v AC11_8' data-id='AC11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But I said, ‘By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ </span>
<span class='v AC11_9' data-id='AC11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But the voice answered a second time from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, do not call common.’ </span>
<span class='v AC11_10' data-id='AC11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. </span>
<span class='v AC11_11' data-id='AC11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. </span>
<span class='v AC11_12' data-id='AC11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house. </span>
<span class='v AC11_13' data-id='AC11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; </span>
<span class='v AC11_14' data-id='AC11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’ </span>
<span class='v AC11_15' data-id='AC11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. </span>
<span class='v AC11_16' data-id='AC11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ </span>
<span class='v AC11_17' data-id='AC11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?” </span>
<span class='v AC11_18' data-id='AC11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Church in Antioch </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_19' data-id='AC11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. </span>
<span class='v AC11_20' data-id='AC11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. </span>
<span class='v AC11_21' data-id='AC11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC11_22' data-id='AC11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_23' data-id='AC11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, </span>
<span class='v AC11_24' data-id='AC11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. </span>
<span class='v AC11_25' data-id='AC11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, </span>
<span class='v AC11_26' data-id='AC11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v AC11_27' data-id='AC11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. </span>
<span class='v AC11_28' data-id='AC11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius). </span>
<span class='v AC11_29' data-id='AC11_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. </span>
<span class='v AC11_30' data-id='AC11_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. </span></div></div>
