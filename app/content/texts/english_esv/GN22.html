<div class='s'>The Sacrifice of Isaac </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN22_1' data-id='GN22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After these things God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_2' data-id='GN22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_3' data-id='GN22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>So Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and his son Isaac. And he cut the wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. </span>
<span class='v GN22_4' data-id='GN22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place from afar. </span>
<span class='v GN22_5' data-id='GN22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; I and the boy will go over there and worship and come again to you.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_6' data-id='GN22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. </span>
<span class='v GN22_7' data-id='GN22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” </span>
<span class='v GN22_8' data-id='GN22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Abraham said, “God will provide for himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN22_9' data-id='GN22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. </span>
<span class='v GN22_10' data-id='GN22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to slaughter his son. </span>
<span class='v GN22_11' data-id='GN22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_12' data-id='GN22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>He said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him, for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_13' data-id='GN22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. </span>
<span class='v GN22_14' data-id='GN22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So Abraham called the name of that place, “The LORD will provide”; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN22_15' data-id='GN22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham a second time from heaven </span>
<span class='v GN22_16' data-id='GN22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, </span>
<span class='v GN22_17' data-id='GN22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is on the seashore. And your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, </span>
<span class='v GN22_18' data-id='GN22_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_19' data-id='GN22_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they arose and went together to Beersheba. And Abraham lived at Beersheba. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN22_20' data-id='GN22_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now after these things it was told to Abraham, “Behold, Milcah also has borne children to your brother Nahor: </span>
<span class='v GN22_21' data-id='GN22_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram, </span>
<span class='v GN22_22' data-id='GN22_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” </span>
<span class='v GN22_23' data-id='GN22_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>(Bethuel fathered Rebekah.) These eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham's brother. </span>
<span class='v GN22_24' data-id='GN22_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>Moreover, his concubine, whose name was Reumah, bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah. </span></div></div>
