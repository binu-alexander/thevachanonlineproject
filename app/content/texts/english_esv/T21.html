<span class='v T21_2' data-id='T21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>To Timothy, my beloved child: </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<span class='v T21_3' data-id='T21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day. </span>
<span class='v T21_4' data-id='T21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy. </span>
<span class='v T21_5' data-id='T21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well. </span>
<span class='v T21_6' data-id='T21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands, </span>
<span class='v T21_7' data-id='T21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v T21_8' data-id='T21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, </span>
<span class='v T21_9' data-id='T21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, </span>
<span class='v T21_10' data-id='T21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel, </span>
<span class='v T21_11' data-id='T21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher, </span>
<span class='v T21_12' data-id='T21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me. </span>
<span class='v T21_13' data-id='T21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. </span>

<span class='v T21_16' data-id='T21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains, </span>
<span class='v T21_17' data-id='T21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me— </span>
<span class='v T21_18' data-id='T21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day!—and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus. </span></div></div>
