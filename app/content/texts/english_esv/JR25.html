<span class='v JR25_1' data-id='JR25_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), </span>
<span class='v JR25_2' data-id='JR25_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: </span>
<span class='v JR25_3' data-id='JR25_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>“For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, to this day, the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken persistently to you, but you have not listened. </span>
<span class='v JR25_4' data-id='JR25_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>You have neither listened nor inclined your ears to hear, although the LORD persistently sent to you all his servants the prophets, </span>
<span class='v JR25_5' data-id='JR25_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>saying, ‘Turn now, every one of you, from his evil way and evil deeds, and dwell upon the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers from of old and forever. </span>
<span class='v JR25_6' data-id='JR25_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Do not go after other gods to serve and worship them, or provoke me to anger with the work of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’ </span>
<span class='v JR25_7' data-id='JR25_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Yet you have not listened to me, declares the LORD, that you might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR25_8' data-id='JR25_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>“Therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words, </span>

<span class='v JR25_10' data-id='JR25_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Moreover, I will banish from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the grinding of the millstones and the light of the lamp. </span>
<span class='v JR25_11' data-id='JR25_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. </span>
<span class='v JR25_12' data-id='JR25_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Then after seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the LORD, making the land an everlasting waste. </span>
<span class='v JR25_13' data-id='JR25_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>I will bring upon that land all the words that I have uttered against it, everything written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. </span>
