<span class='v R129_1' data-id='R129_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for the palace will not be for man but for the LORD God. </span>
<span class='v R129_2' data-id='R129_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble. </span>
<span class='v R129_3' data-id='R129_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God: </span>
<span class='v R129_4' data-id='R129_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>3,000 talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house, </span>
<span class='v R129_5' data-id='R129_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to the LORD?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_6' data-id='R129_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Then the leaders of fathers' houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and the officers over the king's work. </span>
<span class='v R129_7' data-id='R129_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron. </span>
<span class='v R129_8' data-id='R129_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the LORD, in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite. </span>
<span class='v R129_9' data-id='R129_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a whole heart they had offered freely to the LORD. David the king also rejoiced greatly. </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_10' data-id='R129_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Therefore David blessed the LORD in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: “Blessed are you, O LORD, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever. </span>
<span class='v R129_11' data-id='R129_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours.

<span class='v R129_12' data-id='R129_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all. </span>
<span class='v R129_13' data-id='R129_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_14' data-id='R129_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>“But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you. </span>
<span class='v R129_15' data-id='R129_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no abiding. </span>
<span class='v R129_16' data-id='R129_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>O LORD our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own. </span>
<span class='v R129_17' data-id='R129_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you. </span>
<span class='v R129_18' data-id='R129_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>O LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you. </span>
<span class='v R129_19' data-id='R129_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may build the palace for which I have made provision.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_20' data-id='R129_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then David said to all the assembly, “Bless the LORD your God.” And all the assembly blessed the LORD, the God of their fathers, and bowed their heads and paid homage to the LORD and to the king. </span>
<span class='v R129_21' data-id='R129_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And they offered sacrifices to the LORD, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the LORD, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel. </span>
<span class='v R129_22' data-id='R129_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And they ate and drank before the LORD on that day with great gladness. </span></div>

<span class='v R129_22' data-id='R129_22'>And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and they anointed him as prince for the LORD, and Zadok as priest. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v R129_23' data-id='R129_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him. </span>
<span class='v R129_24' data-id='R129_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. </span>
<span class='v R129_25' data-id='R129_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the LORD made Solomon very great in the sight of all Israel and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. </span></div>

<span class='v R129_28' data-id='R129_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Then he died at a good age, full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place. </span>
