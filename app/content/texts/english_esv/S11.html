<div class='c'>1</div>
<div class='s'>The Birth of Samuel </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_1' data-id='S11_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. </span>
<span class='v S11_2' data-id='S11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_3' data-id='S11_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v S11_4' data-id='S11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. </span>
<span class='v S11_5' data-id='S11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the LORD had closed her womb. </span>
<span class='v S11_6' data-id='S11_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb. </span>
<span class='v S11_7' data-id='S11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. </span>
<span class='v S11_8' data-id='S11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, “Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_9' data-id='S11_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD. </span>
<span class='v S11_10' data-id='S11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD and wept bitterly. </span>
<span class='v S11_11' data-id='S11_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And she vowed a vow and said, “O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_12' data-id='S11_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth. </span>
<span class='v S11_13' data-id='S11_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. </span>
<span class='v S11_14' data-id='S11_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And Eli said to her, “How long will you go on being drunk? Put away your wine from you.” </span>
<span class='v S11_15' data-id='S11_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD. </span>
<span class='v S11_16' data-id='S11_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.” </span>
<span class='v S11_17' data-id='S11_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.” </span>
<span class='v S11_18' data-id='S11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And she said, “Let your servant find favor in your eyes.” Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_19' data-id='S11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her. </span>
<span class='v S11_20' data-id='S11_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, “I have asked for him from the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Samuel Given to the LORD </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_21' data-id='S11_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. </span>
<span class='v S11_22' data-id='S11_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the LORD and dwell there forever.” </span>
<span class='v S11_23' data-id='S11_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word.” So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. </span>
<span class='v S11_24' data-id='S11_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. And the child was young. </span>
<span class='v S11_25' data-id='S11_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. </span>
<span class='v S11_26' data-id='S11_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And she said, “Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD. </span>
<span class='v S11_27' data-id='S11_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my petition that I made to him. </span>
<span class='v S11_28' data-id='S11_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore I have lent him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v S11_28' data-id='S11_28'>And he worshiped the LORD there. </span></div></div>
