<div class='s'>Laborers in the Vineyard </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_1' data-id='MT20_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>“For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. </span>
<span class='v MT20_2' data-id='MT20_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span>
<span class='v MT20_3' data-id='MT20_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, </span>
<span class='v MT20_4' data-id='MT20_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and to them he said, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_5' data-id='MT20_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. </span>
<span class='v MT20_6' data-id='MT20_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, ‘Why do you stand here idle all day?’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_7' data-id='MT20_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_8' data-id='MT20_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_9' data-id='MT20_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. </span>
<span class='v MT20_10' data-id='MT20_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. </span>
<span class='v MT20_11' data-id='MT20_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, </span>
<span class='v MT20_12' data-id='MT20_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>saying, ‘These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_13' data-id='MT20_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? </span>
<span class='v MT20_14' data-id='MT20_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. </span>
<span class='v MT20_15' data-id='MT20_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?’ </span>
<span class='v MT20_16' data-id='MT20_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So the last will be first, and the first last.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Foretells His Death a Third Time </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_17' data-id='MT20_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span> And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, </span>
<span class='v MT20_18' data-id='MT20_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death </span>
<span class='v MT20_19' data-id='MT20_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Mother's Request </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_20' data-id='MT20_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span> Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. </span>
<span class='v MT20_21' data-id='MT20_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” </span>
<span class='v MT20_22' data-id='MT20_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.” </span>
<span class='v MT20_23' data-id='MT20_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>He said to them, “You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.” </span>
<span class='v MT20_24' data-id='MT20_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. </span>
<span class='v MT20_25' data-id='MT20_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>But Jesus called them to him and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span>
<span class='v MT20_26' data-id='MT20_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, </span>
<span class='v MT20_27' data-id='MT20_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, </span>
<span class='v MT20_28' data-id='MT20_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus Heals Two Blind Men </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MT20_29' data-id='MT20_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span> And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. </span>
<span class='v MT20_30' data-id='MT20_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” </span>
<span class='v MT20_31' data-id='MT20_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” </span>
<span class='v MT20_32' data-id='MT20_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And stopping, Jesus called them and said, “What do you want me to do for you?” </span>
<span class='v MT20_33' data-id='MT20_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.” </span>
<span class='v MT20_34' data-id='MT20_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him. </span></div></div>
