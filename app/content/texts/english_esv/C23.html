<div class='s'>Ministers of the New Covenant </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_1' data-id='C23_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you? </span>
<span class='v C23_2' data-id='C23_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all. </span>
<span class='v C23_3' data-id='C23_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_4' data-id='C23_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. </span>
<span class='v C23_5' data-id='C23_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God, </span>
<span class='v C23_6' data-id='C23_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_7' data-id='C23_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, </span>
<span class='v C23_8' data-id='C23_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory? </span>
<span class='v C23_9' data-id='C23_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory. </span>
<span class='v C23_10' data-id='C23_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it. </span>
<span class='v C23_11' data-id='C23_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C23_12' data-id='C23_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, </span>
<span class='v C23_13' data-id='C23_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end. </span>
<span class='v C23_14' data-id='C23_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away. </span>
<span class='v C23_15' data-id='C23_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts. </span>
<span class='v C23_16' data-id='C23_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. </span>
<span class='v C23_17' data-id='C23_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. </span>
<span class='v C23_18' data-id='C23_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit. </span></div></div>
