<span class='v P11_2' data-id='P11_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: </span></div>

<span class='v P11_4' data-id='P11_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you, </span>
<span class='v P11_5' data-id='P11_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. </span>

<span class='v P11_7' data-id='P11_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>so that the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. </span>
<span class='v P11_8' data-id='P11_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory, </span>

<span class='v P11_10' data-id='P11_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, </span>

<span class='v P11_18' data-id='P11_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, </span>
<span class='v P11_19' data-id='P11_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. </span>
