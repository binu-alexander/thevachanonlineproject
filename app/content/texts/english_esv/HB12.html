<div class='c'>12</div>
<div class='s'>Jesus, Founder and Perfecter of Our Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_1' data-id='HB12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, </span>
<span class='v HB12_2' data-id='HB12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Do Not Grow Weary </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_3' data-id='HB12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted. </span>
<span class='v HB12_4' data-id='HB12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. </span>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'>“My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB12_5' data-id='HB12_5'>nor be weary when reproved by him. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB12_6' data-id='HB12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB12_6' data-id='HB12_6'>and chastises every son whom he receives.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB12_7' data-id='HB12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline? </span>
<span class='v HB12_8' data-id='HB12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. </span>
<span class='v HB12_9' data-id='HB12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live? </span>
<span class='v HB12_10' data-id='HB12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness. </span>
<span class='v HB12_11' data-id='HB12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_12' data-id='HB12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees, </span>
<span class='v HB12_13' data-id='HB12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed. </span>
<span class='v HB12_14' data-id='HB12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. </span>
<span class='v HB12_15' data-id='HB12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no “root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled; </span>
<span class='v HB12_16' data-id='HB12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. </span>
<span class='v HB12_17' data-id='HB12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Kingdom That Cannot Be Shaken </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_18' data-id='HB12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest </span>
<span class='v HB12_19' data-id='HB12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them. </span>
<span class='v HB12_20' data-id='HB12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>For they could not endure the order that was given, “If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.” </span>
<span class='v HB12_21' data-id='HB12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.” </span>
<span class='v HB12_22' data-id='HB12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, </span>
<span class='v HB12_23' data-id='HB12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect, </span>
<span class='v HB12_24' data-id='HB12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB12_25' data-id='HB12_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven. </span>
<span class='v HB12_26' data-id='HB12_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.” </span>
<span class='v HB12_27' data-id='HB12_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of things that are shaken—that is, things that have been made—in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain. </span>
<span class='v HB12_28' data-id='HB12_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, </span>
<span class='v HB12_29' data-id='HB12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>for our God is a consuming fire. </span></div></div>
