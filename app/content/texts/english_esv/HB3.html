<div class='s'>Jesus Greater Than Moses </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB3_1' data-id='HB3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, </span>
<span class='v HB3_2' data-id='HB3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house. </span>
<span class='v HB3_3' data-id='HB3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. </span>
<span class='v HB3_4' data-id='HB3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.) </span>
<span class='v HB3_5' data-id='HB3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, </span>
<span class='v HB3_6' data-id='HB3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Rest for the People of God </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_7' data-id='HB3_7'>“Today, if you hear his voice, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_8' data-id='HB3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_8' data-id='HB3_8'>on the day of testing in the wilderness, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_9' data-id='HB3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>where your fathers put me to the test </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_9' data-id='HB3_9'>and saw my works </span>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for forty years. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'>Therefore I was provoked with that generation, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'>and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_10' data-id='HB3_10'>they have not known my ways.’ </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_11' data-id='HB3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>As I swore in my wrath, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_11' data-id='HB3_11'>‘They shall not enter my rest.’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB3_12' data-id='HB3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God. </span>
<span class='v HB3_13' data-id='HB3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. </span>
<span class='v HB3_14' data-id='HB3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For we share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end. </span>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>As it is said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'>“Today, if you hear his voice, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB3_15' data-id='HB3_15'>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB3_16' data-id='HB3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses? </span>
<span class='v HB3_17' data-id='HB3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? </span>
<span class='v HB3_18' data-id='HB3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient? </span>
<span class='v HB3_19' data-id='HB3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief. </span></div></div>
