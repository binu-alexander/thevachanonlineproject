<div class='s'>The Fall of Babylon </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV18_1' data-id='RV18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory. </span>
<span class='v RV18_2' data-id='RV18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he called out with a mighty voice, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV18_2' data-id='RV18_2'>“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV18_2' data-id='RV18_2'>She has become a dwelling place for demons, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV18_2' data-id='RV18_2'>a haunt for every unclean spirit, </span></div>

<span class='v RV18_3' data-id='RV18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For all nations have drunk </span></div>

<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV18_3' data-id='RV18_3'>and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV18_4' data-id='RV18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, </span></div>
