<div class='c'>21</div>
<div class='s'>The New Heaven and the New Earth </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_1' data-id='RV21_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more. </span>
<span class='v RV21_2' data-id='RV21_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. </span>
<span class='v RV21_3' data-id='RV21_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. </span>
<span class='v RV21_4' data-id='RV21_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning nor crying nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_5' data-id='RV21_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” </span>
<span class='v RV21_6' data-id='RV21_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment. </span>
<span class='v RV21_7' data-id='RV21_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son. </span>
<span class='v RV21_8' data-id='RV21_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>The New Jerusalem </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_9' data-id='RV21_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.” </span>
<span class='v RV21_10' data-id='RV21_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, </span>
<span class='v RV21_11' data-id='RV21_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. </span>
<span class='v RV21_12' data-id='RV21_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed— </span>
<span class='v RV21_13' data-id='RV21_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates. </span>
<span class='v RV21_14' data-id='RV21_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_15' data-id='RV21_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls. </span>
<span class='v RV21_16' data-id='RV21_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>The city lies foursquare; its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal. </span>
<span class='v RV21_17' data-id='RV21_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel's measurement. </span>
<span class='v RV21_18' data-id='RV21_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass. </span>
<span class='v RV21_19' data-id='RV21_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, </span>
<span class='v RV21_20' data-id='RV21_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. </span>
<span class='v RV21_21' data-id='RV21_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV21_22' data-id='RV21_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. </span>
<span class='v RV21_23' data-id='RV21_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb. </span>
<span class='v RV21_24' data-id='RV21_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, </span>
<span class='v RV21_25' data-id='RV21_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. </span>
<span class='v RV21_26' data-id='RV21_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations. </span>
<span class='v RV21_27' data-id='RV21_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life. </span></div></div>
