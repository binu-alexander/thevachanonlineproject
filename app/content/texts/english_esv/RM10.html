<div class='chapter section RM10 engESV eng RM latin' dir='ltr' data-id='RM10' data-nextid='RM11' data-previd='RM9' lang='en-US'>
<div class='c'>10</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM10_1' data-id='RM10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved. </span>
<span class='v RM10_2' data-id='RM10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge. </span>
<span class='v RM10_3' data-id='RM10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For, being ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. </span>
<span class='v RM10_4' data-id='RM10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Message of Salvation to All </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM10_5' data-id='RM10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. </span>
<span class='v RM10_6' data-id='RM10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But the righteousness based on faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ down) </span>
<span class='v RM10_7' data-id='RM10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>or “ ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ ” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). </span>
<span class='v RM10_8' data-id='RM10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim); </span>
<span class='v RM10_9' data-id='RM10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. </span>
<span class='v RM10_10' data-id='RM10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. </span>
<span class='v RM10_11' data-id='RM10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” </span>
<span class='v RM10_12' data-id='RM10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. </span>
<span class='v RM10_13' data-id='RM10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM10_14' data-id='RM10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But how are they to call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? </span>
<span class='v RM10_15' data-id='RM10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” </span>
<span class='v RM10_16' data-id='RM10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?” </span>
<span class='v RM10_17' data-id='RM10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM10_18' data-id='RM10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM10_18' data-id='RM10_18'>“Their voice has gone out to all the earth, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM10_18' data-id='RM10_18'>and their words to the ends of the world.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM10_19' data-id='RM10_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM10_19' data-id='RM10_19'>“I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM10_19' data-id='RM10_19'>with a foolish nation I will make you angry.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM10_20' data-id='RM10_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RM10_20' data-id='RM10_20'>“I have been found by those who did not seek me; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RM10_20' data-id='RM10_20'>I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RM10_21' data-id='RM10_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>But of Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.” </span></div></div>
