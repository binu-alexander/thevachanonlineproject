<span class='v JG10_1' data-id='JG10_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. </span>
<span class='v JG10_2' data-id='JG10_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG10_3' data-id='JG10_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. </span>
<span class='v JG10_4' data-id='JG10_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. </span>
<span class='v JG10_5' data-id='JG10_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And Jair died and was buried in Kamon. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Further Disobedience and Oppression </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG10_6' data-id='JG10_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook the LORD and did not serve him. </span>
<span class='v JG10_7' data-id='JG10_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites, </span>
<span class='v JG10_8' data-id='JG10_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. </span>
<span class='v JG10_9' data-id='JG10_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG10_10' data-id='JG10_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And the people of Israel cried out to the LORD, saying, “We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals.” </span>
<span class='v JG10_11' data-id='JG10_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And the LORD said to the people of Israel, “Did I not save you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines? </span>
<span class='v JG10_12' data-id='JG10_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand. </span>
<span class='v JG10_13' data-id='JG10_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more. </span>
<span class='v JG10_14' data-id='JG10_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.” </span>
<span class='v JG10_15' data-id='JG10_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And the people of Israel said to the LORD, “We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day.” </span>
<span class='v JG10_16' data-id='JG10_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD, and he became impatient over the misery of Israel. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JG10_17' data-id='JG10_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah. </span>
<span class='v JG10_18' data-id='JG10_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” </span></div></div>
