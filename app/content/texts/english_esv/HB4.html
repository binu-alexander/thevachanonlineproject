<div class='c'>4</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB4_1' data-id='HB4_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it. </span>
<span class='v HB4_2' data-id='HB4_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened. </span>
<span class='v HB4_3' data-id='HB4_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB4_3' data-id='HB4_3'>“As I swore in my wrath, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB4_3' data-id='HB4_3'>‘They shall not enter my rest,’ ” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB4_3' data-id='HB4_3'>although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. </span>
<span class='v HB4_4' data-id='HB4_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.” </span>
<span class='v HB4_5' data-id='HB4_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And again in this passage he said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB4_5' data-id='HB4_5'>“They shall not enter my rest.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB4_6' data-id='HB4_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, </span>
<span class='v HB4_7' data-id='HB4_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v HB4_7' data-id='HB4_7'>“Today, if you hear his voice, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v HB4_7' data-id='HB4_7'>do not harden your hearts.” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v HB4_8' data-id='HB4_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. </span>
<span class='v HB4_9' data-id='HB4_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, </span>
<span class='v HB4_10' data-id='HB4_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB4_11' data-id='HB4_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience. </span>
<span class='v HB4_12' data-id='HB4_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. </span>
<span class='v HB4_13' data-id='HB4_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus the Great High Priest </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v HB4_14' data-id='HB4_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. </span>
<span class='v HB4_15' data-id='HB4_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. </span>
<span class='v HB4_16' data-id='HB4_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. </span></div></div>
