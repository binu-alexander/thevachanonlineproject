<div class='c'>2</div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_1' data-id='C22_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you. </span>
<span class='v C22_2' data-id='C22_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained? </span>
<span class='v C22_3' data-id='C22_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all. </span>
<span class='v C22_4' data-id='C22_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Forgive the Sinner </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_5' data-id='C22_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure—not to put it too severely—to all of you. </span>
<span class='v C22_6' data-id='C22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough, </span>
<span class='v C22_7' data-id='C22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. </span>
<span class='v C22_8' data-id='C22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him. </span>
<span class='v C22_9' data-id='C22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything. </span>
<span class='v C22_10' data-id='C22_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, </span>
<span class='v C22_11' data-id='C22_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Triumph in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_12' data-id='C22_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, </span>
<span class='v C22_13' data-id='C22_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v C22_14' data-id='C22_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. </span>
<span class='v C22_15' data-id='C22_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, </span>
<span class='v C22_16' data-id='C22_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? </span>
<span class='v C22_17' data-id='C22_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ. </span></div></div>
