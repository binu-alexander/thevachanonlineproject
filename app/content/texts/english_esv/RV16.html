<div class='s'>The Seven Bowls of God's Wrath </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_1' data-id='RV16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_2' data-id='RV16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_3' data-id='RV16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_4' data-id='RV16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. </span>
<span class='v RV16_5' data-id='RV16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV16_5' data-id='RV16_5'>“Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV16_5' data-id='RV16_5'>for you brought these judgments. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV16_6' data-id='RV16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV16_6' data-id='RV16_6'>and you have given them blood to drink. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV16_6' data-id='RV16_6'>It is what they deserve!” </span></div>
<div class='m'>
<span class='v RV16_7' data-id='RV16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>And I heard the altar saying, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v RV16_7' data-id='RV16_7'>“Yes, Lord God the Almighty, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v RV16_7' data-id='RV16_7'>true and just are your judgments!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_8' data-id='RV16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire. </span>
<span class='v RV16_9' data-id='RV16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_10' data-id='RV16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish </span>
<span class='v RV16_11' data-id='RV16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_12' data-id='RV16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east. </span>
<span class='v RV16_13' data-id='RV16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs. </span>
<span class='v RV16_14' data-id='RV16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty. </span>
<span class='v RV16_15' data-id='RV16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>(“Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!”) </span>
<span class='v RV16_16' data-id='RV16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Seventh Bowl </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RV16_17' data-id='RV16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, “It is done!” </span>
<span class='v RV16_18' data-id='RV16_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake. </span>
<span class='v RV16_19' data-id='RV16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. </span>
<span class='v RV16_20' data-id='RV16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. </span>
<span class='v RV16_21' data-id='RV16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe. </span></div></div>
