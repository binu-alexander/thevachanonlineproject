<div class='s'>A Living Sacrifice </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_1' data-id='RM12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. </span>
<span class='v RM12_2' data-id='RM12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Gifts of Grace </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_3' data-id='RM12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. </span>
<span class='v RM12_4' data-id='RM12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, </span>
<span class='v RM12_5' data-id='RM12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. </span>
<span class='v RM12_6' data-id='RM12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; </span>
<span class='v RM12_7' data-id='RM12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; </span>
<span class='v RM12_8' data-id='RM12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness. </span></div>
<div class='s'>Marks of the True Christian </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_9' data-id='RM12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. </span>
<span class='v RM12_10' data-id='RM12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. </span>
<span class='v RM12_11' data-id='RM12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. </span>
<span class='v RM12_12' data-id='RM12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. </span>
<span class='v RM12_13' data-id='RM12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. </span></div>
<div class='p'>

<span class='v RM12_16' data-id='RM12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be conceited. </span>
<span class='v RM12_17' data-id='RM12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. </span>
<span class='v RM12_18' data-id='RM12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. </span>
<span class='v RM12_19' data-id='RM12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” </span>
<span class='v RM12_20' data-id='RM12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” </span>
<span class='v RM12_21' data-id='RM12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. </span></div></div>
