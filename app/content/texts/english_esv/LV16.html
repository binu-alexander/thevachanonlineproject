<span class='v LV16_1' data-id='LV16_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before the LORD and died, </span>
<span class='v LV16_2' data-id='LV16_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>and the LORD said to Moses, “Tell Aaron your brother not to come at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil, before the mercy seat that is on the ark, so that he may not die. For I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. </span>
<span class='v LV16_3' data-id='LV16_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>But in this way Aaron shall come into the Holy Place: with a bull from the herd for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering. </span>
<span class='v LV16_4' data-id='LV16_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>He shall put on the holy linen coat and shall have the linen undergarment on his body, and he shall tie the linen sash around his waist, and wear the linen turban; these are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water and then put them on. </span>
<span class='v LV16_5' data-id='LV16_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he shall take from the congregation of the people of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. </span></div>

<span class='v LV16_6' data-id='LV16_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. </span>
<span class='v LV16_7' data-id='LV16_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the LORD at the entrance of the tent of meeting. </span>
<span class='v LV16_8' data-id='LV16_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the LORD and the other lot for Azazel. </span>
<span class='v LV16_9' data-id='LV16_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the LORD and use it as a sin offering, </span>
<span class='v LV16_10' data-id='LV16_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel. </span></div>

<span class='v LV16_11' data-id='LV16_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Aaron shall present the bull as a sin offering for himself, and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall kill the bull as a sin offering for himself. </span>
<span class='v LV16_12' data-id='LV16_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he shall take a censer full of coals of fire from the altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and he shall bring it inside the veil </span>
<span class='v LV16_13' data-id='LV16_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>and put the incense on the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is over the testimony, so that he does not die. </span>
<span class='v LV16_14' data-id='LV16_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he shall take some of the blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the mercy seat on the east side, and in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times. </span></div>

<span class='v LV16_15' data-id='LV16_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it over the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. </span>
<span class='v LV16_16' data-id='LV16_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Thus he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleannesses of the people of Israel and because of their transgressions, all their sins.

<span class='v LV16_17' data-id='LV16_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>No one may be in the tent of meeting from the time he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out and has made atonement for himself and for his house and for all the assembly of Israel. </span>

<span class='v LV16_19' data-id='LV16_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>And he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleannesses of the people of Israel. </span></div>

<span class='v LV16_20' data-id='LV16_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>“And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place and the tent of meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat. </span>
<span class='v LV16_21' data-id='LV16_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the iniquities of the people of Israel, and all their transgressions, all their sins.

<span class='v LV16_22' data-id='LV16_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>The goat shall bear all their iniquities on itself to a remote area, and he shall let the goat go free in the wilderness. </span></div>

<span class='v LV16_25' data-id='LV16_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And the fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar. </span>
<span class='v LV16_26' data-id='LV16_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And he who lets the goat go to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. </span>
<span class='v LV16_27' data-id='LV16_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>And the bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be carried outside the camp. Their skin and their flesh and their dung shall be burned up with fire. </span>
<span class='v LV16_28' data-id='LV16_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>And he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. </span></div>
