<div class='s'>By Grace Through Faith </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP2_1' data-id='EP2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>And you were dead in the trespasses and sins </span>
<span class='v EP2_2' data-id='EP2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— </span>
<span class='v EP2_3' data-id='EP2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. </span>
<span class='v EP2_4' data-id='EP2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, </span>
<span class='v EP2_5' data-id='EP2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— </span>
<span class='v EP2_6' data-id='EP2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, </span>
<span class='v EP2_7' data-id='EP2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. </span>
<span class='v EP2_8' data-id='EP2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, </span>
<span class='v EP2_9' data-id='EP2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>not a result of works, so that no one may boast. </span>
<span class='v EP2_10' data-id='EP2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. </span></div>
<div class='s'>One in Christ </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v EP2_11' data-id='EP2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— </span>
<span class='v EP2_12' data-id='EP2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. </span>
<span class='v EP2_13' data-id='EP2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. </span>
<span class='v EP2_14' data-id='EP2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility </span>
<span class='v EP2_15' data-id='EP2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace, </span>
<span class='v EP2_16' data-id='EP2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. </span>
<span class='v EP2_17' data-id='EP2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near. </span>
<span class='v EP2_18' data-id='EP2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. </span>
<span class='v EP2_19' data-id='EP2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, </span>
<span class='v EP2_20' data-id='EP2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, </span>
<span class='v EP2_21' data-id='EP2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. </span>
<span class='v EP2_22' data-id='EP2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit. </span></div></div>
