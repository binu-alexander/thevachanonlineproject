<div class='s'>A Man with a Withered Hand </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_1' data-id='MK3_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span> Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. </span>
<span class='v MK3_2' data-id='MK3_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_3' data-id='MK3_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>And he said to the man with the withered hand, “Come here.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_4' data-id='MK3_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>And he said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent. </span>
<span class='v MK3_5' data-id='MK3_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. </span>
<span class='v MK3_6' data-id='MK3_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him. </span></div>
<div class='s'>A Great Crowd Follows Jesus </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_7' data-id='MK3_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea </span>
<span class='v MK3_8' data-id='MK3_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_9' data-id='MK3_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, </span>
<span class='v MK3_10' data-id='MK3_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_11' data-id='MK3_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_12' data-id='MK3_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>And he strictly ordered them not to make him known. </span></div>
<div class='s'>The Twelve Apostles </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_13' data-id='MK3_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_14' data-id='MK3_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach </span>
<span class='v MK3_15' data-id='MK3_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>and have authority to cast out demons. </span>
<span class='v MK3_16' data-id='MK3_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); </span>
<span class='v MK3_17' data-id='MK3_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); </span>
<span class='v MK3_18' data-id='MK3_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, </span>
<span class='v MK3_19' data-id='MK3_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_20' data-id='MK3_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. </span>
<span class='v MK3_21' data-id='MK3_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_22' data-id='MK3_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_23' data-id='MK3_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span> And he called them to him and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan? </span>
<span class='v MK3_24' data-id='MK3_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. </span>
<span class='v MK3_25' data-id='MK3_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. </span>
<span class='v MK3_26' data-id='MK3_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. </span>
<span class='v MK3_27' data-id='MK3_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_28' data-id='MK3_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span> “Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, </span>
<span class='v MK3_29' data-id='MK3_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”— </span>
<span class='v MK3_30' data-id='MK3_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>for they had said, “He has an unclean spirit.” </span></div>
<div class='s'>Jesus' Mother and Brothers </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v MK3_31' data-id='MK3_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. </span>
<span class='v MK3_32' data-id='MK3_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, “Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you.” </span>
<span class='v MK3_33' data-id='MK3_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>And he an swered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” </span>
<span class='v MK3_34' data-id='MK3_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! </span>
<span class='v MK3_35' data-id='MK3_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother.” </span></div></div>
