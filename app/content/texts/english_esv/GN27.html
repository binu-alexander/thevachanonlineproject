<div class='s'>Isaac Blesses Jacob </div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_1' data-id='GN27_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son”; and he answered, “Here I am.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_2' data-id='GN27_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>He said, “Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death. </span>
<span class='v GN27_3' data-id='GN27_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt game for me, </span>
<span class='v GN27_4' data-id='GN27_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>and prepare for me delicious food, such as I love, and bring it to me so that I may eat, that my soul may bless you before I die.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_5' data-id='GN27_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, </span>
<span class='v GN27_6' data-id='GN27_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “I heard your father speak to your brother Esau, </span>
<span class='v GN27_7' data-id='GN27_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>‘Bring me game and prepare for me delicious food, that I may eat it and bless you before the LORD before I die.’ </span>
<span class='v GN27_8' data-id='GN27_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice as I command you. </span>
<span class='v GN27_9' data-id='GN27_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats, so that I may prepare from them delicious food for your father, such as he loves. </span>
<span class='v GN27_10' data-id='GN27_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>And you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_11' data-id='GN27_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. </span>
<span class='v GN27_12' data-id='GN27_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_13' data-id='GN27_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>His mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_14' data-id='GN27_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared delicious food, such as his father loved. </span>
<span class='v GN27_15' data-id='GN27_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. </span>
<span class='v GN27_16' data-id='GN27_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. </span>
<span class='v GN27_17' data-id='GN27_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>And she put the delicious food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_18' data-id='GN27_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>So he went in to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” </span>
<span class='v GN27_19' data-id='GN27_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that your soul may bless me.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_20' data-id='GN27_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?” He answered, “Because the LORD your God granted me success.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_21' data-id='GN27_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_22' data-id='GN27_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, “The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_23' data-id='GN27_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him. </span>
<span class='v GN27_24' data-id='GN27_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>He said, “Are you really my son Esau?” He answered, “I am.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_25' data-id='GN27_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>Then he said, “Bring it near to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you.” So he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_26' data-id='GN27_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>Then his father Isaac said to him, “Come near and kiss me, my son.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'><span class='v-num v-27'>27&nbsp;</span>So he came near and kissed him. And Isaac smelled the smell of his garments and blessed him and said, </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'>“See, the smell of my son </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_27' data-id='GN27_27'>is as the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed! </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'><span class='v-num v-28'>28&nbsp;</span>May God give you of the dew of heaven </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'>and of the fatness of the earth </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_28' data-id='GN27_28'>and plenty of grain and wine. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Let peoples serve you, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and nations bow down to you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>Be lord over your brothers, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and may your mother's sons bow down to you. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>Cursed be everyone who curses you, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_29' data-id='GN27_29'>and blessed be everyone who blesses you!” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_30' data-id='GN27_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. </span>
<span class='v GN27_31' data-id='GN27_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span>He also prepared delicious food and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_32' data-id='GN27_32'><span class='v-num v-32'>32&nbsp;</span>His father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_33' data-id='GN27_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac trembled very violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be blessed.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_34' data-id='GN27_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>As soon as Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” </span>
<span class='v GN27_35' data-id='GN27_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully, and he has taken away your blessing.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_36' data-id='GN27_36'><span class='v-num v-36'>36&nbsp;</span>Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” </span>
<span class='v GN27_37' data-id='GN27_37'><span class='v-num v-37'>37&nbsp;</span>Isaac answered and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?” </span>
<span class='v GN27_38' data-id='GN27_38'><span class='v-num v-38'>38&nbsp;</span>Esau said to his father, “Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” And Esau lifted up his voice and wept. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'><span class='v-num v-39'>39&nbsp;</span>Then Isaac his father answered and said to him: </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'>“Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_39' data-id='GN27_39'>and away from the dew of heaven on high. </span></div>
<div class='q'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'><span class='v-num v-40'>40&nbsp;</span>By your sword you shall live, </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>and you shall serve your brother; </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>but when you grow restless </span></div>
<div class='q2'>
<span class='v GN27_40' data-id='GN27_40'>you shall break his yoke from your neck.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_41' data-id='GN27_41'><span class='v-num v-41'>41&nbsp;</span>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” </span>
<span class='v GN27_42' data-id='GN27_42'><span class='v-num v-42'>42&nbsp;</span>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah. So she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. </span>
<span class='v GN27_43' data-id='GN27_43'><span class='v-num v-43'>43&nbsp;</span>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran </span>
<span class='v GN27_44' data-id='GN27_44'><span class='v-num v-44'>44&nbsp;</span>and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away— </span>
<span class='v GN27_45' data-id='GN27_45'><span class='v-num v-45'>45&nbsp;</span>until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and bring you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v GN27_46' data-id='GN27_46'><span class='v-num v-46'>46&nbsp;</span>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I loathe my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women like these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?” </span></div></div>
