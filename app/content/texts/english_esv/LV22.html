<span class='v LV22_6' data-id='LV22_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>the person who touches such a thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water. </span>
<span class='v LV22_7' data-id='LV22_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>When the sun goes down he shall be clean, and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because they are his food. </span>
<span class='v LV22_8' data-id='LV22_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>He shall not eat what dies of itself or is torn by beasts, and so make himself unclean by it: I am the LORD.’ </span>
<span class='v LV22_9' data-id='LV22_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it and die thereby when they profane it: I am the LORD who sanctifies them. </span></div>
