<span class='v JN12_1' data-id='JN12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Then six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_2' data-id='JN12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>So they made him a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_3' data-id='JN12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Therefore Mary took a pound<span class='note' id='footnote-957'><a href='#note-957' class='key'>*</a></span> of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed Jesus’s feet and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment. </span>
<span class='v JN12_4' data-id='JN12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, </span>
<span class='v JN12_5' data-id='JN12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>“Why wasn’t this ointment sold for three hundred denarii,<span class='note' id='footnote-958'><a href='#note-958' class='key'>†</a></span> and given to the poor?” </span>
<span class='v JN12_6' data-id='JN12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to steal what was put into it. </span>
<span class='v JN12_7' data-id='JN12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>But Jesus said, <span class='wj'>“Leave her alone. She has kept this for the day of my burial. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN12_8' data-id='JN12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>For you always have the poor with you, but you don’t always have me.”</span> </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_9' data-id='JN12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead. </span>
<span class='v JN12_10' data-id='JN12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also, </span>
<span class='v JN12_11' data-id='JN12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>because on account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus. </span></div>

<span class='v JN12_12' data-id='JN12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, </span>
<span class='v JN12_13' data-id='JN12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him, and cried out, “Hosanna!<span class='note' id='footnote-959'><a href='#note-959' class='key'>‡</a></span> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,<span class='note' id='footnote-960'><a href='#note-960' class='key'>✡</a></span> the King of Israel!” </span></div>

<span class='v JN12_14' data-id='JN12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it. As it is written, </span>

<span class='v JN12_16' data-id='JN12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him, and that they had done these things to him. </span>
<span class='v JN12_17' data-id='JN12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was testifying about it. </span>
<span class='v JN12_18' data-id='JN12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done this sign. </span>
<span class='v JN12_19' data-id='JN12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the world has gone after him.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN12_20' data-id='JN12_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast. </span>
<span class='v JN12_21' data-id='JN12_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>These, therefore, came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.” </span>
<span class='v JN12_22' data-id='JN12_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus. </span>
<span class='v JN12_23' data-id='JN12_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered them, <span class='wj'>“The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN12_24' data-id='JN12_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit. </span> </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_28' data-id='JN12_28'>Then a voice came out of the sky, saying, “I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.” </span></div>

<span class='v JN12_29' data-id='JN12_29'><span class='v-num v-29'>29&nbsp;</span>Therefore the multitude who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_30' data-id='JN12_30'><span class='v-num v-30'>30&nbsp;</span>Jesus answered, <span class='wj'>“This voice hasn’t come for my sake, but for your sakes. </span> </span>
<span class='v JN12_31' data-id='JN12_31'><span class='v-num v-31'>31&nbsp;</span> <span class='wj'>Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be cast out. </span> </span>

<span class='v JN12_33' data-id='JN12_33'><span class='v-num v-33'>33&nbsp;</span>But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die. </span>
<span class='v JN12_34' data-id='JN12_34'><span class='v-num v-34'>34&nbsp;</span>The multitude answered him, “We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<span class='note' id='footnote-962'><a href='#note-962' class='key'>✡</a></span> How do you say, <span class='wj'>‘The Son of Man must be lifted up?’</span> Who is this Son of Man?” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JN12_35' data-id='JN12_35'><span class='v-num v-35'>35&nbsp;</span>Jesus therefore said to them, <span class='wj'>“Yet a little while the light is with you.
