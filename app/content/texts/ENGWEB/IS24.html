<span class='v IS24_10' data-id='IS24_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>The confused city is broken down. Every house is shut up, that no man may come in. </span>
<span class='v IS24_11' data-id='IS24_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>There is a crying in the streets because of the wine. All joy is darkened. The mirth of the land is gone. </span>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v IS24_21' data-id='IS24_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth. </span>
