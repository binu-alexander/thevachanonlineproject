<span class='v JM2_1' data-id='JM2_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>My brothers, don’t hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with partiality. </span>
<span class='v JM2_2' data-id='JM2_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>For if a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, comes into your synagogue,<span class='note' id='footnote-1311'><a href='#note-1311' class='key'>*</a></span> and a poor man in filthy clothing also comes in, </span>
<span class='v JM2_3' data-id='JM2_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing and say, “Sit here in a good place;” and you tell the poor man, “Stand there,” or “Sit by my footstool” </span>
<span class='v JM2_4' data-id='JM2_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>haven’t you shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts? </span>
<span class='v JM2_5' data-id='JM2_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Listen, my beloved brothers. Didn’t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him? </span>
<span class='v JM2_6' data-id='JM2_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>But you have dishonored the poor man. Don’t the rich oppress you, and personally drag you before the courts? </span>
<span class='v JM2_7' data-id='JM2_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>Don’t they blaspheme the honorable name by which you are called? </span>
<span class='v JM2_8' data-id='JM2_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>However, if you fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,”<span class='note' id='footnote-1312'><a href='#note-1312' class='key'>✡</a></span> you do well. </span>
<span class='v JM2_9' data-id='JM2_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors. </span>
<span class='v JM2_10' data-id='JM2_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles in one point, he has become guilty of all. </span>
<span class='v JM2_11' data-id='JM2_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,”<span class='note' id='footnote-1313'><a href='#note-1313' class='key'>✡</a></span> also said, “Do not commit murder.”<span class='note' id='footnote-1314'><a href='#note-1314' class='key'>✡</a></span> Now if you do not commit adultery, but murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. </span>
<span class='v JM2_12' data-id='JM2_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>So speak and so do, as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom. </span>
<span class='v JM2_13' data-id='JM2_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>For judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_14' data-id='JM2_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>What good is it, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but has no works? Can faith save him? </span>
<span class='v JM2_15' data-id='JM2_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>And if a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food, </span>
<span class='v JM2_16' data-id='JM2_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace. Be warmed and filled;” yet you didn’t give them the things the body needs, what good is it? </span>
<span class='v JM2_17' data-id='JM2_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead in itself. </span>
<span class='v JM2_18' data-id='JM2_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Yes, a man will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JM2_19' data-id='JM2_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe, and shudder. </span>
<span class='v JM2_20' data-id='JM2_20'><span class='v-num v-20'>20&nbsp;</span>But do you want to know, vain man, that faith apart from works is dead? </span>
<span class='v JM2_21' data-id='JM2_21'><span class='v-num v-21'>21&nbsp;</span>Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? </span>
<span class='v JM2_22' data-id='JM2_22'><span class='v-num v-22'>22&nbsp;</span>You see that faith worked with his works, and by works faith was perfected. </span>
<span class='v JM2_23' data-id='JM2_23'><span class='v-num v-23'>23&nbsp;</span>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness,”<span class='note' id='footnote-1315'><a href='#note-1315' class='key'>✡</a></span> and he was called the friend of God. </span>
<span class='v JM2_24' data-id='JM2_24'><span class='v-num v-24'>24&nbsp;</span>You see then that by works, a man is justified, and not only by faith. </span>
<span class='v JM2_25' data-id='JM2_25'><span class='v-num v-25'>25&nbsp;</span>In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works, in that she received the messengers and sent them out another way? </span>
<span class='v JM2_26' data-id='JM2_26'><span class='v-num v-26'>26&nbsp;</span>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead. </span></div></div>
