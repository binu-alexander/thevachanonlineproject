<span class='v RM12_1' data-id='RM12_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service. </span>
<span class='v RM12_2' data-id='RM12_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_3' data-id='RM12_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>For I say through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith. </span>
<span class='v RM12_4' data-id='RM12_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function, </span>
<span class='v RM12_5' data-id='RM12_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another, </span>
<span class='v RM12_6' data-id='RM12_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us: if prophecy, let’s prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; </span>
<span class='v RM12_7' data-id='RM12_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>or service, let’s give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching; </span>
<span class='v RM12_8' data-id='RM12_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>or he who exhorts, to his exhorting; he who gives, let him do it with generosity; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v RM12_9' data-id='RM12_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good. </span>
<span class='v RM12_10' data-id='RM12_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate to one another; in honor preferring one another; </span>
<span class='v RM12_11' data-id='RM12_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; </span>
<span class='v RM12_12' data-id='RM12_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer; </span>
<span class='v RM12_13' data-id='RM12_13'><span class='v-num v-13'>13&nbsp;</span>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality. </span>
<span class='v RM12_14' data-id='RM12_14'><span class='v-num v-14'>14&nbsp;</span>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse. </span>
<span class='v RM12_15' data-id='RM12_15'><span class='v-num v-15'>15&nbsp;</span>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. </span>
<span class='v RM12_16' data-id='RM12_16'><span class='v-num v-16'>16&nbsp;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits. </span>
<span class='v RM12_17' data-id='RM12_17'><span class='v-num v-17'>17&nbsp;</span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men. </span>
<span class='v RM12_18' data-id='RM12_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men. </span>
<span class='v RM12_19' data-id='RM12_19'><span class='v-num v-19'>19&nbsp;</span>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” <span class='note' id='footnote-1132'><a href='#note-1132' class='key'>✡</a></span> </span>
