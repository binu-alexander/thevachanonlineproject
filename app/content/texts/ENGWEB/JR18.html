<span class='v JR18_1' data-id='JR18_1'><span class='verse1 v-num v-1'>1&nbsp;</span>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR18_2' data-id='JR18_2'><span class='v-num v-2'>2&nbsp;</span>“Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.” </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_3' data-id='JR18_3'><span class='v-num v-3'>3&nbsp;</span>Then I went down to the potter’s house, and behold, he was making something on the wheels. </span>
<span class='v JR18_4' data-id='JR18_4'><span class='v-num v-4'>4&nbsp;</span>When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter, he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_5' data-id='JR18_5'><span class='v-num v-5'>5&nbsp;</span>Then Yahweh’s word came to me, saying, </span>
<span class='v JR18_6' data-id='JR18_6'><span class='v-num v-6'>6&nbsp;</span>“House of Israel, can’t I do with you as this potter?” says Yahweh. “Behold, as the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, house of Israel. </span>
<span class='v JR18_7' data-id='JR18_7'><span class='v-num v-7'>7&nbsp;</span>At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; </span>
<span class='v JR18_8' data-id='JR18_8'><span class='v-num v-8'>8&nbsp;</span>if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them. </span>
<span class='v JR18_9' data-id='JR18_9'><span class='v-num v-9'>9&nbsp;</span>At the instant I speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; </span>
<span class='v JR18_10' data-id='JR18_10'><span class='v-num v-10'>10&nbsp;</span>if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them. </span></div>
<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_11' data-id='JR18_11'><span class='v-num v-11'>11&nbsp;</span>“Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Yahweh says: “Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a plan against you.

<span class='v JR18_12' data-id='JR18_12'><span class='v-num v-12'>12&nbsp;</span>But they say, ‘It is in vain; for we will walk after our own plans, and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’ ” </span></div>

<div class='p'>
<span class='v JR18_18' data-id='JR18_18'><span class='v-num v-18'>18&nbsp;</span>Then they said, “Come!
